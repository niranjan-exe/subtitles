00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,991
That's a pretty potent mix.

159
00:16:18,992 --> 00:16:22,995
-We have a mission yet?
-Indeed we do.

160
00:16:22,996 --> 00:16:27,999
Our mission is to hunt down and
kill the leader of the Na'vi insurgency.

161
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,003
The one they call "Toruk Makto".

162
00:16:32,004 --> 00:16:34,424
Jake Sully.

163
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:46,016
Attack, attack! Got you!

164
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:48,018
Come on now, Tuk.

165
00:16:48,019 --> 00:16:49,769
I'm definetly faster when I'm blue.

166
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,153
You skawng.

167
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:53,022
Seriously, and the animals respect me more.

168
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:56,943
-They don't think of me as human.
-Wait, you're human?

169
00:16:56,944 --> 00:16:58,028
Ha ha.

170
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:08,037
They are coming!

171
00:17:08,038 --> 00:17:13,041
<b>THE FORTRESS OF THE OMATIKAYAS</b>

172
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:15,042
They're coming! Kiri! Spider!

173
00:17:15,043 --> 00:17:19,046
The war party is coming back. Come on!

174
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:20,751
Come along.

175
00:17:35,062 --> 00:17:38,065
-Mom!
-Tuk, Tuk, Tuk.

176
00:17:40,066 --> 00:17:42,068
Fall in!

177
00:17:43,114 --> 00:17:45,232
You're supposed to be spotters.

178
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:47,156
You spot bogeys and call them in.

179
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:48,703
From a distance!

180
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:52,917
Does that sound familiar? Jesus,
I let you two geniuses fly a mission

181
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:55,079
And you disobey direct orders.

182
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,034
Kiri, can you go help your
grandmother with the wounded.

183
00:17:58,054 --> 00:18:00,084
My brother is wounded

184
00:18:00,086 --> 00:18:04,088
-Tuk, go with her. Go!
-Father, I take full responsibility.

185
00:18:05,892 --> 00:18:10,093
Yes, because you are the
older brother, you gotta act like it.

186
00:18:10,094 --> 00:18:13,585
MaJake, your son is actually bleeding.

187
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:16,184
Mother, it's fine, I -

188
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,990
Go and get patched up.
Go on, dismissed.

189
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:28,444
You do understand that you
almost got your brother killed.

190
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:30,042
-Yes, sir.

191
00:18:31,113 --> 00:18:34,115
You're grounded. No flying for a month.

192
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:35,926
Now see to the Ikrans.

193
00:18:35,927 --> 00:18:40,027
All of them. And get that crap off your face.

194
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:50,740
-Aw! A little kiss on the boo boo.
-Give him this.

195
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:56,135
-I would use yalnabark.
-Oh you would? And who is Tsahik?

196
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,057
You are, grandma, move.

197
00:18:58,058 --> 00:19:00,849
You are, grandma but yalnabark is better.

198
00:19:02,595 --> 00:19:04,904
It stings less.

199
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:07,093
Mighty warriors.

200
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,153
What is it?

201
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:21,158
Neteyam and Lo'ak try to live up to you.

202
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,161
It's very hard for them.

203
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:27,164
I know.

204
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:31,442
You are very hard on them.

205
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:36,172
I am their father. That's my job.

206
00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:40,602
This is not a squad. It is a family.

207
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:53,188
I thought we had lost him.

208
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:04,197
-Hi there.
-Hey, Spider.

209
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:07,200
-Your ass is mine.
-I'm right here.

210
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:11,204
Avatars only. Go around.

211
00:20:11,205 --> 00:20:13,738
The blue stripes don't
make you any bigger bro.

212
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:16,894
I can still kick your ass.

213
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:23,215
-Hell of a day.
-Homerun.

214
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:26,009
Yeah, haha. Real hysterical guys.

215
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,386
You know what really sucks though.

216
00:20:27,387 --> 00:20:29,220
You can breathe Earth air for hours.

217
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:31,222
I can only breathe your
air for like 10 seconds.

218
00:20:31,223 --> 00:20:34,725
Yes, monkey boy. That really sucks,

219
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:36,228
For you.

220
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:44,234
-Hey, Max.
-Hey, kids.

221
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:46,070
Hey, what's up Max.

222
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:47,072
Lo'ak.

223
00:20:52,242 --> 00:20:54,244
Hi Mom.

224
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:08,256
Maybe I'm just losing it out
here but I see real evidence -

225
00:21:08,257 --> 00:21:12,463
of a systemic response on a global level.

226
00:21:12,465 --> 00:21:14,971
I can not...

227
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:18,976
<i><font color="#80ffff">I will not use the word "intelligence".</i></font>

228
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:22,023
<i><font color="#80ffff">"Awareness" is probably a better word.</i></font>

229
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,092
<i><font color="#80ffff">It's as if the entire biosphere on Pandora</i></font>

230
00:21:26,093 --> 00:21:32,098
<i><font color="#80ffff">is aware and capable
of this cognitive response.</i></font>

231
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:38,229
Oh crap, I can't say
that. They'll crucify me.

232
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,106
So, who do you think knocked her up?

233
00:21:41,107 --> 00:21:45,110
-Pretty sure it was Norm.
-Totally.

234
00:21:45,111 --> 00:21:48,113
-You don't deserve to live.
-Think about it.

235
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:52,088
He is the teachers pet. He's
out at the lab with her all the time.

236
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,119
I would kill myself. I would drink acid.

237
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,621
Bro, you're right! He's like in every shot.

238
00:21:57,622 --> 00:22:01,750
Look, he's giving her the looks!
-Hey!

239
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:05,170
See, I'm thinking their two
avatars together out in the woods…

240
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,130
...All alone.
-Gross!

241
00:22:07,131 --> 00:22:12,442
Guys, I mean, Sometimes it's not
so great to know who your father was.

242
00:22:16,139 --> 00:22:19,141
Whatever. I don't even remember him.

243
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:20,267
No, Spider...

244
00:22:20,268 --> 00:22:21,143
Dude.

245
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:23,557
Spider...

246
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:27,149
You are not him.

247
00:22:35,157 --> 00:22:38,159
<b>BRIDGEHEAD CITY</b>

251
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:24,691
Colonel; It's the general.

252
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,211
General Ardmore.

253
00:23:35,212 --> 00:23:37,848
Nice to meet you, Colonel.

254
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,761
I hear good things.

255
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:43,767
But a lot has changed since
your last tour here. Walk with me.

256
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:50,225
The new command center, it's
over here, that just came online.

257
00:23:50,226 --> 00:23:54,228
The sworn assemblers can
put up a building in six days.

258
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:59,233
We have done more here in a
year than in the previous thirty years.

259
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:02,669
We are not here to run a
mine, Colonel. As onworld

260
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:06,240
commander, I have been
charged with a greater mission.

261
00:24:10,244 --> 00:24:12,912
Earth is dying.

262
00:24:12,913 --> 00:24:17,374
Our task here is to tame this frontier.

263
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:22,254
Nothing less than to make
Pandora the new home for humanity.

264
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:27,574
But before we can do that,
we need to pacify the hostiles

265
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:33,264
Sully's raids are becoming
bolder and more frequent.

266
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:35,569
His attacks are well executed. Got tight

267
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,269
coordination between
his ground and air assets.

268
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,090
These forces are hitting our outline sites.

269
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:44,274
Mines, Pipelines, cutting
off our supply chain.

270
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,803
They hit a mag train two days ago.

271
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:57,991
-Any intel on Sully's base of operations?
-Yeah. Bring up the mountains.

272
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:02,391
It's a cave system in the
Hallelujah Mountains somewhere.

273
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:08,213
But every time we send our
forces up there, we take losses.

274
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:12,134
Our hardware really
stirs up the hornets nest.

275
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:16,304
We only get ten minutes in
enemy airspace they are all over us.

276
00:25:18,306 --> 00:25:22,309
Colonel; We believe your blue
team will be perceived as indigenous

277
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:25,312
and will not trigger the immune response.

278
00:25:25,313 --> 00:25:29,315
And how might we test
that hypothesis, General?

279
00:25:29,316 --> 00:25:32,318
The hard way.

280
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:34,850
Outstanding.

281
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:51,336

-Go, monkeyboy!
-Guys! Wait up!

283
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:44,099
Tuk, come on!

284
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:45,385
Okay, okay.

285
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:47,387
Bro why did you bring her anyway?

286
00:26:47,388 --> 00:26:50,161
She's such a crybaby.

287
00:26:50,162 --> 00:26:52,391
"I'm telling. You're not
supposed to go to the battlefield."

288
00:26:52,392 --> 00:26:54,352
"I'll tell mom if you don't let me come."

289
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:56,826
Don't pick on her.

290
00:26:57,397 --> 00:26:59,398
Come on.

291
00:26:59,399 --> 00:27:01,259
Oh sick!

292
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:04,702
Are there any dead bodies up there?

293
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,447
No shit.

294
00:28:01,456 --> 00:28:04,458
Kiri? Kiri.

295
00:28:07,461 --> 00:28:10,554
Kiri. Kiri... Eh, eh

296
00:28:16,469 --> 00:28:18,061
Are you okay?

297
00:28:18,062 --> 00:28:20,472
I was doing that thing again, wasn't I?

298
00:28:20,473 --> 00:28:23,475
Yeah, you were.

299
00:28:23,476 --> 00:28:24,726

Come on.

303
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,361
What is it?

304
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:37,955
We're always supposed to be home by eclipse.

305
00:28:39,821 --> 00:28:43,368
-Way too big for a human.
-Avatars?

306
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:46,372
Maybe, they're for sure not ours.

307
00:28:48,374 --> 00:28:50,979
-What are you doing?
-Shh, I'm tracking.

308
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:11,395
Watch your six.

309
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:16,399
Clear.

310
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:20,403

Damn.

312
00:29:56,436 --> 00:29:59,438
We are never supposed to come here.

313
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:01,440
Dad is going to ground you.

314
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:02,983
-Dad is going to ground you.
-Shhhhh. Stop.

315
00:30:02,984 --> 00:30:04,442
For life.

316
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:08,447
Bro, we have got to check this out, let's go.

317
00:30:24,462 --> 00:30:30,466
Bro, that's where your dad and my dad fought.

318
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:33,395
That's your dads actual suit.

319
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:35,555
Holy shit...

320
00:30:35,556 --> 00:30:40,475
Lyle, see if you can pull
some data off that dashcam.

321
00:30:40,476 --> 00:30:44,479
-Thing is deader than shit, Colonel.
-So were we.

322
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,566
-Better call this in.
-No bro, we're gonna get in trouble.

323
00:30:47,567 --> 00:30:49,269
-Let's go.

324
00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:58,201
-Devil Dog, This is Eagle Eye, over.
-Eagle Eye, send your traffic.

325
00:30:58,202 --> 00:31:00,371
I've got eyes on some guys.

326
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:03,496
They look like avatars

327
00:31:03,497 --> 00:31:08,793
<i><font color="#80ffff">but they're in full camo and carrying
AR's. There are six of them; over.</i></font>

328
00:31:08,794 --> 00:31:11,504
What's your pos; over?

329
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:14,508
We are at the old shack.

330
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:18,510
Who's we?

331
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:22,514
Me, Spider, Kiri...

332
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:24,517
and Tuk.

333
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,232
Son, you listen to me very
carefully. Pull back right now.

334
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:33,524
Do not make a sound.

335
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:37,152
-Get the hell out of there. Move, copy?
-Yes sir, moving out.

336
00:31:37,153 --> 00:31:39,530
-See I told you.

337
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:42,048
Dad, I know a quick way!

338
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:50,665
-You're going to be in so much trouble.
-Kiri, stop.

339
00:31:50,666 --> 00:31:53,420
-Guys, come on.
-It's almost eclipse, come on.

340
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:59,548
-Put it down or I'll shoot you!
-With me.

341
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:01,551
-Drop it!
-Right now!

342
00:32:03,803 --> 00:32:06,212
Put it down, put it down.

343
00:32:08,557 --> 00:32:09,895
Get over here.

344
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:13,561
Down on your knees! Stop fighting.

345
00:32:13,562 --> 00:32:17,381
-Check them for weapons.
-Kiri!

346
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:21,027
Be calm.

347
00:32:21,028 --> 00:32:23,252
Shut up! Don't move!

348
00:32:23,254 --> 00:32:25,255
What have we here?

349
00:32:34,581 --> 00:32:40,044
Look, Colonel. Check it out.
4 fingers. We've a half-breed.

350
00:32:40,045 --> 00:32:41,755
-Shit.

351
00:32:47,635 --> 00:32:50,055
Show me your fingers.

352
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:56,601
You're his, aren't you?

353
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:01,606
You're his alright.

354
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:09,612
Where is he?

355
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,615
{\an5} Unfortunately I don't speak English -

356
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,617
{\an5} with assholes.

357
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,033
{\an5} Where is your father?

358
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,442
Really? You wanna play it this way.

359
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,466
Shut up!

360
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:34,204
Kiri!
-No! Stop! Hey! Hey!

361
00:33:34,205 --> 00:33:36,637
Don't touch her!

362
00:33:36,638 --> 00:33:38,640
Don't hurt her, please.

363
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:43,644
-Don't move.
-What's your name, kid?

364
00:33:45,646 --> 00:33:49,650
Spider, Socorro.

365
00:33:57,657 --> 00:33:59,659
Miles?

366
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,663
Nobody calls me that.

367
00:34:06,665 --> 00:34:08,694
I'll be damned.

368
00:34:09,209 --> 00:34:12,499
I figured they sent you back to Earth.

369
00:34:13,672 --> 00:34:16,674
You can't put babies in cryo, dipshit.

370
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,112
What do we do, boss?

371
00:34:26,684 --> 00:34:29,686
Iron Sky, Blue on Actual

372
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,753
Blue on Iron Sky, send your traffic.

373

<i><font color="#80ffff">We are standing by for extract, over.</i></font>

-Dragonfly coming left.

375
00:34:41,072 --> 00:34:42,990
-We are go for extract.

376
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:45,284
Be advised. We're bringing
high value prisoners.

377
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:46,702
Let us go!
-Shut up!

378
00:34:46,703 --> 00:34:49,768
Sit tight, we're inbound.

379
00:34:49,769 --> 00:34:51,240
Bingo in ten.

380

<i><font color="#80ffff">We're on the clock.</i></font>

381
00:34:57,712 --> 00:35:00,715
Lyle, get me some audio on this.

382
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:05,944
It's Sully's woman.

383
00:35:05,945 --> 00:35:07,720
She's a wild animal.

384
00:35:07,721 --> 00:35:10,723
Give up, Quaritch.

385
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:14,727
-Sully.
-It's all over.

386
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:17,729
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

387
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:20,997
I was hoping you would say that.

388
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:39,834
-You stay with the Ikrans.
-Dad, I'm a warrior like you.

389
00:35:39,835 --> 00:35:40,793
I'm supposed to fight.

390
00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:41,751
-Neyteyam.

391
00:35:41,752 --> 00:35:43,692
I won't say it again.

392
00:35:44,755 --> 00:35:46,757
Yes, sir.

393
00:36:08,777 --> 00:36:11,780
There is nothing after that.

394
00:36:23,791 --> 00:36:26,794
Should we salvage the remains?

395
00:36:52,818 --> 00:36:55,819

Three minutes.

397
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:15,282
Watch our 6.

398
00:38:02,431 --> 00:38:04,208
Shut up!

399
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:19,897
Shut up.

400
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,901
Contact made!

401
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:28,906
Lo'ak!

402
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:34,910
You little shit!

403
00:38:34,911 --> 00:38:37,241
Tuk, come on!

404
00:38:37,242 --> 00:38:39,185
Race!

405
00:38:45,921 --> 00:38:47,922
Come along!

406
00:38:47,923 --> 00:38:49,925
In cover!

407
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,295
Come now!

408
00:39:08,942 --> 00:39:11,517
Is that you, Mrs. Sully?

409
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:14,948
I recognize your calling card.

410
00:39:23,956 --> 00:39:27,790
Come on out, Mrs. Sully.

411
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:30,962
The two of us have some unfinished business.

412
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:40,971
Demon! I will kill you as
many times as I have to.

413
00:39:40,972 --> 00:39:44,974
You and the Corporal have
been pretty busy, haven't you?

414
00:39:44,975 --> 00:39:49,980
<i><font color="#80ffff">Got yourself a whole litter of half-breeds.</i></font>

Go! Go! Go!

417
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:08,182
Are you okay, boy?

418
00:40:08,183 --> 00:40:10,253
Follow me. Ready?! Ready?!

419
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,002
Move!

420
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:19,672
Come on!

After them!

423
00:40:38,024 --> 00:40:39,753
Spider?

424
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:44,877
Spider!
-Kiri!

425
00:40:44,878 --> 00:40:45,993
Spider!

426
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:48,032
Come here!

427
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:50,035
Spider is down there!

428
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,480
Then we are ahead. We have ten minutes.

429
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:03,099
Blue 1, back to the collection point.

430
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:12,054
-Blue 1, fall back.
-Back!

431
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:14,057
Back, back! Take off!

432
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,062
Kiri, come on! Come on!

433
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:23,065
Go, go, run!

434
00:41:25,356 --> 00:41:27,357
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm fine.

435
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,361
Tuk, are you hurt?

436
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:51,090
There we're clear. Is everyone okay?

437
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,873
Tuk!

438
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:58,096
It's okay.

439
00:41:58,097 --> 00:42:01,886
Thank you, Great Mother, thank you.

440
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,100
Thank you.

441
00:42:03,102 --> 00:42:05,103
Where is Spider?

442
00:42:05,104 --> 00:42:09,106
They took him. They took him.

443
00:42:09,107 --> 00:42:11,168
Take it easy, honey.

444
00:42:11,169 --> 00:42:14,112
He's a tough kid.

445
00:42:16,114 --> 00:42:19,115
He'll be okay.

446
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:22,119
We're all gonna be okay.

447
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:38,777
Let me out of here!

448
00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:47,986
He's completely ferile.

449
00:42:47,987 --> 00:42:50,988
He thinks he is one of them.

454
00:43:03,491 --> 00:43:06,494
I can not. You can not ask this.

455
00:43:08,496 --> 00:43:11,119
I cannot leave my people.

456
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,498
I will not.

457
00:43:12,499 --> 00:43:14,459
He's hunting us.

458

He's targeting our family.

459
00:43:16,623 --> 00:43:19,755
You can not ask this.
The children, everything

460
00:43:19,756 --> 00:43:23,508
they've ever known, the
forest. This is our home!

461
00:43:23,509 --> 00:43:24,816
He had our children.

462
00:43:24,817 --> 00:43:27,513
He had them under his knife.

463
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:37,521
My father gave me this bow as he lay dying.

464
00:43:37,522 --> 00:43:40,558
He said to protect the people.

465
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,527
You are Toruk Makto!

466
00:43:43,528 --> 00:43:45,736
This will protect the people.

467
00:43:45,737 --> 00:43:48,531
Quaritch has Spider and
that kid knows everything.

470

Do you understand?

471
00:44:01,544 --> 00:44:03,984
I got nothing.

472
00:44:03,985 --> 00:44:06,038
I got no plan.

473
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:09,467
But I can protect this family,

474
00:44:09,468 --> 00:44:11,361
that I can do.

475
00:44:24,565 --> 00:44:26,910
But I know one thing.

476
00:44:28,569 --> 00:44:33,574
Wherever we go, this family is our fortress.

479
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:56,598
Form a picture in your mind.

480
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:58,596
Is it one of the floating mountains?

481
00:44:58,597 --> 00:45:02,599
-Let me outta here!
-He's fighting this; Give us a minute.

482
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,602
Form a thought, and we'll see it.

483
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:11,148
<i><font color="#80ffff">-I do not know!
<i>-I don't like this anymore than you do.</i></font>

484
00:45:11,149 --> 00:45:12,884
Which clans would be harboring him.

485
00:45:12,885 --> 00:45:15,491
I don't know! You're gonna have to kill me.

486
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,615
Watch this he's peaking all over.

487
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,867
It won't stop until you give us something.

488
00:45:21,868 --> 00:45:23,619
Where is he?

489
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,954
I don't know, you buttholes.

490
00:45:25,955 --> 00:45:28,289
I don't know! Ahrg..Agrh!

491
00:45:40,635 --> 00:45:44,277
General, let me try the personal angle.

492
00:45:47,642 --> 00:45:50,316
He is not your son.

493
00:46:20,672 --> 00:46:23,409
Easy, tiger, easy.

494
00:46:31,682 --> 00:46:33,684
We good?

495
00:46:38,688 --> 00:46:40,489
Kid, you got heart.

496
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:44,693
The science pukes leaned on you pretty hard

497
00:46:44,694 --> 00:46:48,285
but you gave them nothing.

498
00:46:48,287 --> 00:46:51,290
I respect that.

499
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:58,837
I thought you might want this.

500
00:47:05,377 --> 00:47:08,964
This is Colonel Miles Quaritch. Deceased.

501
00:47:09,205 --> 00:47:12,208
Killed in action.

502
00:47:16,387 --> 00:47:18,388
I'm not that man.

503
00:47:19,035 --> 00:47:23,039
But I do have his memories.

504
00:47:25,395 --> 00:47:28,397
Enough to know that...

505
00:47:28,398 --> 00:47:31,400
well he wasn't always the best father.

506
00:47:31,401 --> 00:47:34,402
But that is not an apology.

507
00:47:34,403 --> 00:47:38,781
I'm not your father. Technically, you and I,

508
00:47:38,782 --> 00:47:41,667
we're nothing to each other. But..

509
00:47:41,857 --> 00:47:44,962
I can help you.

510
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:47,916
I can get you out of here.

511
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:54,421
I won't ask you to betray Jake Sully.
You would never do that. You are loyal.

512
00:47:54,422 --> 00:47:56,194
And

513
00:47:56,195 --> 00:47:59,425
I admire loyalty.

514
00:47:59,426 --> 00:48:03,429
Now just ride along.

515
00:48:03,898 --> 00:48:07,718
Otherwise I gotta give
you back to the lab coats.

516
00:48:15,441 --> 00:48:19,444
This is like stones in my heart.

517
00:48:19,445 --> 00:48:22,963
Tarsem is young but wise.

518
00:48:22,964 --> 00:48:25,470
He will become a strong olo'eyktan.

519
00:48:26,451 --> 00:48:29,698
The leader must die...

520
00:48:32,457 --> 00:48:35,459
so the leader can be born.

521
00:48:37,127 --> 00:48:39,463
Toruk Makto will disappear.

522
00:48:41,465 --> 00:48:45,104
The people will be safe.

523
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:12,944
A father protects.

524
00:49:12,945 --> 00:49:15,877
It's what gives him meaning.

525
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,500
One life ends.

526
00:49:21,501 --> 00:49:24,339
Another begins.

527
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,517
Oh, Tuk...

528
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:46,016
The sea clans inhabit a world of their own.

529
00:49:46,017 --> 00:49:47,877
Thousands of islands.

530
00:49:47,879 --> 00:49:52,529
An unknown area where we will
be able to disappear without a trace.

531
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:55,549
Are we there yet?

532
00:50:19,555 --> 00:50:22,557
{\an5} <b>AWA'ATLU, IN METKAYINA-VILLAGE</b>

533
00:50:59,591 --> 00:51:03,594
Hey, leave it.

534
00:51:03,595 --> 00:51:06,597
Follow me.

535
00:51:06,598 --> 00:51:08,039
Tuk.

536
00:51:09,601 --> 00:51:11,601
Behave nicely.

537
00:51:12,082 --> 00:51:14,084
Behave nicely.

538
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,623
Take it easy. Just be cool.

539
00:51:35,624 --> 00:51:37,882
Look, what is that?

540
00:51:37,883 --> 00:51:40,340
Is that supposed to be a tail?

541
00:51:55,643 --> 00:51:58,644
It is then too small to swim with.

542
00:51:58,645 --> 00:52:01,648
Do not, Rotxo and Ao'nung.

543
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:05,165
Hey.

544
00:52:29,674 --> 00:52:34,677
<i><font color="#80ffff">Tonowari was chief of the
Metkayina, the reef people.</i></font>

545
00:52:34,678 --> 00:52:38,681
-I see you, Tonowari.
-Jake Sully.

546
00:52:38,682 --> 00:52:41,685
<i><font color="#80ffff">I knew him as a tough leader.</i></font>

547
00:52:44,688 --> 00:52:47,690
But it wasn't Tonowari that worried me.

548
00:52:50,693 --> 00:52:53,695
I see you, Ronal, Tsahik of the Metkayinas.

549
00:52:53,696 --> 00:52:55,958
I see you, Ronal.

550
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,061
Why do you come to us, Jake Sully.

551
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:02,103
We seek Uturu.

552
00:53:02,105 --> 00:53:04,612
Uturu?

553
00:53:04,613 --> 00:53:07,276
Asylum for my family.

554
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:10,918
We are reef people.

555
00:53:10,919 --> 00:53:12,463
You are forest people.

556
00:53:12,464 --> 00:53:14,772
Your skills will mean nothing here.

557
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:18,778
So we will learn your ways, right?

558
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:23,722
Their arms are thin.

559
00:53:23,723 --> 00:53:27,037
Their tails are weak.

560
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:29,947
You will be slow in the water.

561
00:53:31,731 --> 00:53:35,685
These children aren't even true Na'vi.

562
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:38,737
Yes, we are.

563
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,320
There is demon blood in them!

564
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:48,941
Look.

565
00:53:49,288 --> 00:53:50,747
Look.

566
00:53:50,748 --> 00:53:55,752
I was born of the sky people
and now I am Na'vi. You can adapt.

567
00:53:55,753 --> 00:53:58,755
We will adapt. Okay?

568
00:53:58,756 --> 00:54:02,758
My husband was Toruk Makto.

569
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,870
He led the clans to victory

570
00:54:05,871 --> 00:54:08,976
over the Sky People.

571
00:54:10,767 --> 00:54:13,191
This you call victory?

572
00:54:13,193 --> 00:54:16,360
Hiding among strangers?

573
00:54:18,774 --> 00:54:22,280
It seems Eywa has turned her back on you,

574
00:54:22,281 --> 00:54:24,500
Chosen One.

575
00:54:28,783 --> 00:54:30,409
I apologize for my mate.

576
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:33,703
-She has flown a long way and is exhausted.
-Do not apologize for me.

577
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:34,789
Jake.

578
00:54:39,793 --> 00:54:43,075
Toruk Makto is a great war leader.

579
00:54:43,076 --> 00:54:45,798
All Na'vi people know his story.

580
00:54:45,799 --> 00:54:47,840
But we Metkayina

581
00:54:47,841 --> 00:54:49,802
-Dad
-are not at war.

582
00:54:51,804 --> 00:54:54,806
We can not let you bring your war here.

583
00:54:54,807 --> 00:54:57,309
I'm done with war,

584
00:54:57,310 --> 00:54:58,756
okay?

585
00:54:58,758 --> 00:55:02,762
I just want to keep my family safe.

586
00:55:04,816 --> 00:55:07,819
Uturu has been asked.

587
00:55:11,822 --> 00:55:16,295
-Do we have to go?
-Shh, it will be okay.

588
00:55:26,836 --> 00:55:30,839
Toruk Makto and his family will stay with us.

589
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:35,218
Treat them as our brothers and sisters.

590
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:37,845
But they do not know the sea.

591
00:55:37,846 --> 00:55:42,850
So, they will be like babies
taking their first breath.

592
00:55:42,851 --> 00:55:45,669
Teach them our ways
so that they do not suffer

593
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:49,714
the shame of being useless.

594
00:55:50,858 --> 00:55:53,860
-What do you say?
-Thank you.

595
00:55:53,861 --> 00:55:55,862
-(quietly) Thank you.

596
00:55:55,863 --> 00:55:59,865
My son Ao'nung our daughter Tsireya
will show your children what to do.

597
00:55:59,866 --> 00:56:01,867
-Father, why?
-It has been decided.

598
00:56:02,001 --> 00:56:05,725
Come, I will show you our village.

599
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:16,964
This way.

600
00:56:19,885 --> 00:56:21,802
Tuk, let's go.

601
00:56:21,803 --> 00:56:24,039
Just up here.

602
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,479
This is for you.

603
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,898
Your new home.

604
00:56:35,899 --> 00:56:37,900
Yeah, this will work.

605
00:56:37,901 --> 00:56:39,193
This is great.

606
00:56:39,194 --> 00:56:42,381
It's nice right.

607
00:56:53,499 --> 00:56:54,874
Okay, Sully's fall in.

608
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:56,500
Remember? Family meeting.

609
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:58,920
-Come on, take a knee let's go
-Kiri.

610
00:56:59,188 --> 00:57:00,772
What?

611
00:57:02,507 --> 00:57:05,926
I need you kids on your best behavior.

612
00:57:05,927 --> 00:57:07,510
I mean it.

613
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:09,977
Learn fast, pull your weight,

614
00:57:09,978 --> 00:57:12,515
don't cause trouble, got it?

615
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:14,826
Yes, sir.

616
00:57:15,776 --> 00:57:18,558
I want to go home.

617
00:57:19,522 --> 00:57:21,523
Oh, Tuk...

618
00:57:21,926 --> 00:57:24,216
Tuk,

619
00:57:24,217 --> 00:57:26,792
this is our home now.

620
00:57:28,113 --> 00:57:30,532
We're gonna get through this.

621
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:33,659
We're gonna get through this if
we have each others backs, right?

622
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:38,539
-What does your father always say?
-Sully's stick together.

623
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:41,211
That's right, Sully's stick together.

624
00:57:41,212 --> 00:57:43,856
This time with some feeling.

625
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:48,549
-Sully's stick together.
-Sully's stick together.

626
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,374
Come on!

627
00:59:37,649 --> 00:59:39,651
{\an5} Swim together with us.

628
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:16,809
{\an5} -What's wrong with them?

629
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:18,686
{\an5} -They are bad divers.

630
01:00:18,687 --> 01:00:20,270
{\an5} -Stop.

631
01:00:20,271 --> 01:00:21,689
{\an5} They're learning.

632
01:00:31,699 --> 01:00:34,294
Are you okay?

633
01:00:34,295 --> 01:00:36,702
You're too fast! Wait for us.

634
01:00:36,703 --> 01:00:38,871
Just breathe.

635
01:00:38,872 --> 01:00:39,705
Breathe.

636
01:00:39,706 --> 01:00:41,727
You are not good divers.

637
01:00:41,728 --> 01:00:44,334
You may be good at swinging through trees.

638
01:00:44,335 --> 01:00:47,629
-Come on, bro.
-We don't speak this finger talk.

639
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:50,131
-We don't know what you're saying.
-I will teach you.

640
01:00:50,132 --> 01:00:51,759
-Where is Kiri?
-Kiri?

641
01:00:51,759 --> 01:00:52,812
-Who?
-Kiri.

642
01:00:52,814 --> 01:00:55,065
-Where is Kiri?
-Did you see her?

643
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:10,733
Get on the ship, find a
seat, and keep out of the way.

644
01:01:10,734 --> 01:01:12,877
Let's go!

645
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:14,737
Chop Chop.

646
01:01:14,738 --> 01:01:17,740
Whoa, whoa, hold on there hotshot.

647
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:19,935
Listen up.

648
01:01:19,936 --> 01:01:22,744
There is a tracker built into that mask.

649
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,746
We hit the ground and you take off.

650
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,748
I'll have you back in 2 minutes.

651
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:30,249
and I will give you an
old-school ass whooping.

652
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,753
Understood?

653
01:01:31,754 --> 01:01:34,755
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.

654
01:01:35,147 --> 01:01:37,890
-We up?
-Teams up.

655
01:01:51,772 --> 01:01:53,758
Listen up.

656
01:01:53,759 --> 01:01:57,234
Jake Sully has gone underground.

657
01:01:57,235 --> 01:02:00,070
Don't matter, wherever he is, we'll find him.

658
01:02:00,071 --> 01:02:03,270
And his batshit crazy wife too.

659
01:02:04,033 --> 01:02:08,078
To do so. We go Na'vi.

660
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:09,787
Full tilt all the way.

661
01:02:09,788 --> 01:02:11,831
That means we eat Na'vi.

662
01:02:11,832 --> 01:02:13,541
We ride Na'vi.

663
01:02:13,542 --> 01:02:16,043
We think Na'vi.

664
01:02:16,044 --> 01:02:21,382
{\an5} And that starts with speaking the languiage.

665
01:02:23,801 --> 01:02:26,428
{\an5} You call that speaking the language?

666
01:02:26,429 --> 01:02:28,973
{\an5} You sound like a three year old.

667
01:02:30,808 --> 01:02:33,809
Alright, smart guy.

668
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:37,814
You just went from being our
monkey mascot to official interpreter.

669
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:46,664
These are Ilu.

670
01:02:46,665 --> 01:02:50,825
If you want to live here, you have to ride.

671
01:02:50,826 --> 01:02:53,829
Make the bond gently.

672
01:02:57,832 --> 01:03:02,836
Feel his breath. Feel his strength.

673
01:03:02,837 --> 01:03:04,838
Hold here.

674
01:03:04,839 --> 01:03:08,843
-Look at his legs.
-Hold on.

675
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:31,039
Everything alright, forest boy?

676
01:03:39,871 --> 01:03:42,932
This is a warriors mount. Not easy to master

677
01:03:42,933 --> 01:03:46,876
Perhaps you should start with an ilu.

678
01:03:46,877 --> 01:03:48,879
No, this one.

679
01:03:50,881 --> 01:03:53,058
Now remember,

680
01:03:53,059 --> 01:03:56,231
when you dive back in, good position,

681
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:58,354
very important.

682
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:02,892
I got this.

683
01:04:27,915 --> 01:04:30,499
Yes that's it.

684
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,480
Steady.

685
01:05:17,961 --> 01:05:20,351
I love her already.

686
01:05:58,998 --> 01:06:02,001
Breathe in…

687
01:06:04,003 --> 01:06:07,005
and breathe out.

688
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:11,008
Imagine flickering a flame.

689
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:15,012
You must slow down your heartbeat.

690
01:06:15,013 --> 01:06:18,015
Breathe in.

691
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:21,018
Breathe from down here.

692
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:25,000
Breathe out slowly.

693
01:06:26,022 --> 01:06:29,437
Lo'ak, your heartbeat is fast.
-Sorry

694
01:06:29,439 --> 01:06:31,027
-Try to focus.
-Okay

695
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:34,029
Breathe in…

696
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,077
and breathe out.

697
01:06:36,078 --> 01:06:38,707
Let your mind go clear.

698
01:06:56,051 --> 01:06:59,144
You are learning to breathe.

699
01:07:03,516 --> 01:07:06,459
Come on! Keep up losers!

700
01:07:20,281 --> 01:07:22,152
I got this.

701
01:07:27,997 --> 01:07:29,205
What?

702
01:07:29,206 --> 01:07:33,542
Na'vi kids younger than me
do this with their bare hands.

703
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:37,258
Jake Sully do it the hard way?

704
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:39,202
What do you think?

705
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:44,215
What do we do, Cololnel?

706
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,571
This is going to be good.

707
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:54,637
Alright, move up.

708
01:08:00,568 --> 01:08:03,462
It's you and me, cupcake.

709
01:08:15,582 --> 01:08:19,584
Did I mention you're supposed
to tie the mouth shut first?

710
01:08:19,585 --> 01:08:22,130
Thanks a lot, kid.

711
01:08:25,591 --> 01:08:27,652
Move up! Move up!

712
01:08:33,598 --> 01:08:35,983
Can you see them?

713
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:01,624
Come on, we have to move on.

714
01:09:03,626 --> 01:09:05,730
Let's go. Out of here.

715
01:09:11,633 --> 01:09:13,635
Yes, that's right!

716
01:09:16,637 --> 01:09:18,638
-That's right, Colonel!
-Get some!

717
01:09:18,996 --> 01:09:21,998
Whose up next.

718
01:09:28,648 --> 01:09:33,653
The way of water has no beginning and no end.

719
01:09:37,657 --> 01:09:42,789
The sea is around you and in you.

720
01:09:46,665 --> 01:09:50,666
The sea is your home

721
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:53,271
before your birth...

722
01:09:53,273 --> 01:09:56,276
and after your death.

723
01:10:00,678 --> 01:10:03,359
Our hearts beat

724
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:06,079
in the womb of the world.

725
01:10:06,683 --> 01:10:12,272
Our breath burns in the shadows of the deep.

726
01:10:12,689 --> 01:10:15,260
The sea gives

727
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:18,220
and the sea takes.

728
01:10:20,696 --> 01:10:24,070
Water connects all things.

729
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:28,371
Life to death.

730
01:10:29,704 --> 01:10:32,707
Darkness to light.

731
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:38,713
-I got it! Tsireya!
-You did it.

732
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:58,911
{\an5} This will help you breathe underwater.

733
01:11:40,412 --> 01:11:42,770
What is she doing?

734
01:11:42,771 --> 01:11:46,775
-I don't know.
-She's just looking at the sand.

735
01:11:48,486 --> 01:11:49,986
What did you say?

736
01:11:49,987 --> 01:11:53,322
Are you some kind of freak?

737
01:11:53,323 --> 01:11:56,166
He asked if you were a freak.

738
01:11:58,255 --> 01:11:59,786
No.

739
01:11:59,787 --> 01:12:03,123
Are you sure? I mean,
you are not even real Na'vi.

740
01:12:03,124 --> 01:12:06,626
Look at these hands. I mean look at them.

741
01:12:06,627 --> 01:12:09,795
Hey! Back off, fish lips.

742
01:12:09,796 --> 01:12:14,800
-Another four-fingered freak.
-Look at his little baby tail.

743
01:12:14,801 --> 01:12:17,802
-Leave us alone!
-He's not normal.

744
01:12:17,803 --> 01:12:22,807
Look at his tail. It is very cute.

745
01:12:22,808 --> 01:12:25,810
You heard her. Leave them alone.

746
01:12:25,811 --> 01:12:28,813
Big brother coming to-

747
01:12:28,814 --> 01:12:31,764
Back off.

748
01:12:31,765 --> 01:12:34,044
Now.

749
01:12:37,822 --> 01:12:40,324
It's your choice.

750
01:12:40,325 --> 01:12:44,828
And from now on, I need
you to respect my sister.

751
01:12:48,024 --> 01:12:49,833
Let's go.

752
01:12:52,002 --> 01:12:53,835
Bye bye!

753
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:58,840
Look at them, they are
freaks the whole family.

754
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:01,036
Lo'ak...

755
01:13:01,037 --> 01:13:03,281
I got this, bro.

756
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:09,058
I know this hand is funny. Look, I'm a freak.

757
01:13:09,059 --> 01:13:10,851
Alien.

758
01:13:10,852 --> 01:13:13,020
But it can do something cool.

759
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:16,468
Watch, First I tie it really tight. Okay?

760
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:18,472
And then…

761
01:13:21,862 --> 01:13:25,866
It's called a punch bitch. Don't
ever touch my sister again.

762
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:38,877
Hold on!

763
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,292
Stop it!

764
01:13:42,881 --> 01:13:44,883
That's too stupid!

765
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:49,887
Ow, my tail!

766
01:13:49,888 --> 01:13:52,857
My ear! Let it go!

767
01:13:52,858 --> 01:13:55,673
He's got my ear!

768
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:02,379
What was the one thing
I asked. The one thing.

769
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:04,796
Stay out of trouble. Right.
-It was my fault.

770
01:14:04,797 --> 01:14:07,487
I don't think so, you've gotta stop
taking the heat for this knucklehead.

771
01:14:07,488 --> 01:14:10,448
Look dad, Ao'nung was picking on Kiri.

772
01:14:10,449 --> 01:14:12,531
He called her a freak.

773
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:17,746
-Go apologize to Ao'noung.
-What?

774
01:14:17,747 --> 01:14:20,915
-He is the chiefs son. Do you understand?

775
01:14:20,926 --> 01:14:23,924
I don't care how you do
it. Just go make peace.

776
01:14:23,925 --> 01:14:24,930
Just go.

777
01:14:31,926 --> 01:14:35,929
-So what did the other guys look like?
-Worse.

778
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,932
-That's good.
-A lot worse.

779
01:14:38,933 --> 01:14:41,031
Get outta here.

780
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:54,946
What is wrong?

781
01:14:54,947 --> 01:14:57,497
Nothing. I'm fine.

782
01:14:57,498 --> 01:15:00,713
Why should I not be fine?

783
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:10,961
Why can't I just be like everyone else?

784
01:15:11,284 --> 01:15:13,286
Oh, Kiri.

785
01:15:15,967 --> 01:15:18,969
What's tree boy doing here?

786
01:15:21,972 --> 01:15:26,207
Sorry, I hit you, so many times.

787
01:15:31,856 --> 01:15:34,354
We should be friends.

788
01:15:34,984 --> 01:15:38,878
Come hunting with us outside the reef.

789
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:41,990
It's where the men hunt.

790
01:15:41,991 --> 01:15:44,140
No way, I'm not allowed.

791
01:15:44,141 --> 01:15:46,994
I must be asking the wrong brother.

792
01:15:47,419 --> 01:15:50,513
Let's do it.

793
01:16:03,010 --> 01:16:04,525
Come on!

794
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:17,016
Keep up, forest boy.

795
01:16:20,025 --> 01:16:24,029
{\an5} <b>Three Rocks Brothers</b>

796
01:16:31,035 --> 01:16:33,496
You lived.

797
01:16:33,497 --> 01:16:36,039
That was insane cuz.

798
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:39,910
This way, I know a good spot.

799
01:16:50,602 --> 01:16:52,702
{\an5} Call the fish.

800
01:17:08,069 --> 01:17:10,071
{\an5} What a moron.

801
01:17:30,549 --> 01:17:32,341
Hey, guys!

802
01:17:32,342 --> 01:17:33,343
Hey!

803
01:17:36,095 --> 01:17:38,096
Ao'nung!

804
01:17:38,442 --> 01:17:41,209
Come on, this isn't funny.

805
01:21:27,266 --> 01:21:29,514
Holy shit.

806
01:21:58,294 --> 01:22:00,296
You are a tulkun.

807
01:22:02,756 --> 01:22:05,301
You saved my life. Thank you.

808
01:22:07,303 --> 01:22:09,186
Thank you.

809
01:22:14,309 --> 01:22:17,312
Buddy, I have no idea what you said.

810
01:22:23,317 --> 01:22:25,319
They hurt you, didn't they.

811
01:22:27,321 --> 01:22:30,323
I'll try to pull it out.

812
01:22:30,324 --> 01:22:32,325
Trust me.

813
01:23:06,357 --> 01:23:08,359
Friends?

814
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:14,364
Yes, we are friends.

815
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:20,027
Bro!

816
01:24:30,434 --> 01:24:32,436
I am sorry.

817
01:25:11,471 --> 01:25:14,123
What is it baby girl?

818
01:25:14,124 --> 01:25:16,406
Do you miss Spider?

819
01:25:18,478 --> 01:25:22,481
Yes, but that's not it.

820
01:25:24,483 --> 01:25:26,024
Okay.

821
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:29,487
What is it then?

822
01:25:29,488 --> 01:25:33,113
I can feel her, Dad.

823
01:25:33,937 --> 01:25:36,940
-You feel who?
-Eywa.

824
01:25:41,499 --> 01:25:46,014
I can hear her breathing.
I can hear her heartbeat.

825
01:25:46,919 --> 01:25:49,505
She is so close.

826
01:25:49,919 --> 01:25:53,508
She's just there...

827
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:56,513
like a word about to be spoken.

828
01:26:01,517 --> 01:26:05,520
I know you think I'm crazy.

829
01:26:06,235 --> 01:26:09,485
You're not crazy, honey.

830
01:26:12,527 --> 01:26:16,042
So what does Eywa's heartbeat sound like?

831
01:26:20,196 --> 01:26:22,323
Mighty.

832
01:26:28,542 --> 01:26:31,545
Tell him what you told me.

833
01:26:36,549 --> 01:26:39,249
Do you like looking at the stars?

834
01:26:41,554 --> 01:26:44,556
My father came from a star.

835
01:26:44,557 --> 01:26:47,527
The one right there.

836
01:26:49,561 --> 01:26:52,564
-Lo'ak!
-I'm in trouble.

837
01:26:55,567 --> 01:26:59,324
Go. I will see you again.

838
01:27:15,585 --> 01:27:18,518
The boy has been found!

839
01:27:18,519 --> 01:27:21,184
The Sully boy, we found him.

840
01:27:28,597 --> 01:27:31,055
Let's have a look at you.

841
01:27:31,313 --> 01:27:36,318
He's fine. He's fine.
It's just a few scratches.

842
01:27:37,605 --> 01:27:43,204
I pray for the strength that I will not
rip the eyeballs out of my youngest son.

843
01:27:43,611 --> 01:27:44,699
No.

844
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:48,384
My son knows better than
to take him outside the reef.

845
01:27:49,616 --> 01:27:51,750
The blame is his.

846
01:27:52,049 --> 01:27:53,619
Okay, let's go.

847
01:27:53,620 --> 01:27:55,760
No.

848
01:27:56,061 --> 01:27:58,103
It's not Ao'nung's fault.

849
01:27:58,104 --> 01:27:59,624
It was my idea.

850
01:27:59,625 --> 01:28:03,451
Ao'nung tried to talk me out of it. Really.

851
01:28:04,630 --> 01:28:06,287
Lo'ak.

852
01:28:06,288 --> 01:28:07,339
I'm sorry.

853
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:09,264
Come on.

854
01:28:11,636 --> 01:28:13,638
I got this one.

855
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:17,479
Is this true?

856
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:20,568
Ao'noung, what were you thinking?

857
01:28:22,646 --> 01:28:24,688
Dad you told me make friends with these kids.

858
01:28:24,689 --> 01:28:25,826
That's all I was trying to do_

859
01:28:25,828 --> 01:28:28,210
I don't want to hear about it.

860
01:28:28,211 --> 01:28:30,992
You have brought shame to this family.

861
01:28:32,165 --> 01:28:33,551
Can I go now?

862
01:28:33,552 --> 01:28:36,449
Any more trouble, I'll
tie a knot in your tail.

863
01:28:36,450 --> 01:28:38,149
You read me?

864
01:28:38,150 --> 01:28:40,663
Yes sir. Lima Charlie.

865
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:50,911
Where were you?

866
01:28:51,195 --> 01:28:55,534
Yeah, what happened to
keep an eye on your brother.

867
01:28:55,536 --> 01:28:58,370
I'm sorry sir.

868
01:29:00,681 --> 01:29:03,683
Why did you speak for me?

869
01:29:03,684 --> 01:29:07,688
Because I know what it's like
to be one big disappointment.

870
01:29:09,690 --> 01:29:12,097
Wish I had been there.

871
01:29:12,098 --> 01:29:14,452
The ocean blessed you with a gift brother.

872
01:29:14,458 --> 01:29:19,698
The tulkuns have not returned yet
and anyway no tulkun is ever alone.

873
01:29:19,699 --> 01:29:21,700
This one was.

874
01:29:21,701 --> 01:29:26,704
He had a missing fin. Like
a stump on the left side.

875
01:29:26,705 --> 01:29:29,707
Payakan. It's Payakan.

876
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:33,711
-Who is Payakan?
-A young bull who went rogue.

877
01:29:33,712 --> 01:29:37,047
He is outcast, alone and has missing a fin.

878
01:29:37,048 --> 01:29:39,573
They say he is a killer.
-No

879
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:43,720
He killed Na'vi and other Tulkuns.

880
01:29:43,975 --> 01:29:48,724
-Not here, but far to the south.
-No, he's no killer.

881
01:29:48,725 --> 01:29:53,722
-You're lucky to be alive.
-I'm telling you guys, he saved my life.

882
01:29:53,725 --> 01:29:57,302
-He is my friend.
-My baby bro...

883
01:29:57,311 --> 01:30:02,737
The mighty warrior who faced
a killer tulkun and survived.

884
01:30:02,738 --> 01:30:05,740
You guys aren't listening.

885
01:30:05,741 --> 01:30:08,408
-I'm listening.
-Lo'ak, come back.

886
01:30:08,409 --> 01:30:10,995
-You skxawng.

887
01:30:10,996 --> 01:30:12,613
Payakan!

888
01:30:13,998 --> 01:30:15,529
Payakan!

889
01:30:17,001 --> 01:30:19,003
Payakan!

890
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:29,733
Good to see you.

891
01:30:31,014 --> 01:30:35,017
Why are you outcast? What happened?

892
01:30:36,022 --> 01:30:39,020
{\an5} It's too painful.

893
01:30:39,021 --> 01:30:43,085
I trust you.

894
01:30:43,086 --> 01:30:45,785
You can trust me.

895
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:33,012
Bro, that's disgusting.

896
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:38,076
Faster!

897
01:32:13,816 --> 01:32:16,279
We are here.

898
01:32:21,365 --> 01:32:24,138
This is the cove of the ancestors,

899
01:32:24,139 --> 01:32:26,874
our most sacred place.

900
01:32:32,125 --> 01:32:35,885
Eclipse is the best time of day to be here.

901
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:50,653
This is it.

902
01:32:50,654 --> 01:32:53,781
This is The Spirit Tree.

903
01:33:58,162 --> 01:34:01,206
My beautiful daughter.

904
01:34:01,207 --> 01:34:02,707
Hi Mom.

905
01:34:02,708 --> 01:34:06,108
I'm so happy to see you.

906
01:34:06,109 --> 01:34:09,079
But you look troubled.

907
01:34:11,549 --> 01:34:13,425
Shhh, Shhh, Shhh.

908
01:34:13,426 --> 01:34:15,875
My sweet girl.

909
01:34:23,727 --> 01:34:27,070
What is it baby?

910
01:34:27,071 --> 01:34:29,732
Why am I different?

911
01:34:30,559 --> 01:34:34,677
What does the Great Mother want for me?

912
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:39,608
Who was my father?

913
01:34:41,744 --> 01:34:44,747
Oh, my god...

914
01:35:07,768 --> 01:35:10,769
-Come on!
-Kiri!

915
01:35:11,485 --> 01:35:13,487
Kiri!

916
01:35:14,774 --> 01:35:17,680
What's wrong? What is it?

917
01:35:17,681 --> 01:35:19,781
It was a seizure.

918
01:35:19,783 --> 01:35:23,119
Is she breathing?

919
01:35:25,138 --> 01:35:27,730
Get her to the village.

920
01:35:27,731 --> 01:35:29,963
Lets go!

921
01:35:44,802 --> 01:35:48,512
-Good to see you.
-Neteyam, keep them back.

922
01:35:48,513 --> 01:35:50,806
-How is she?
-Still unconscious.

923
01:35:50,807 --> 01:35:55,018
There's no bleed, no fracture.

924
01:35:55,019 --> 01:35:58,151
No signs of Hypoxia.

925
01:36:02,108 --> 01:36:06,153
<i><font color="#80ffff">But there is interictal
activity in the frontal lobe.</i></font>

926
01:36:06,154 --> 01:36:08,289
<i><font color="#80ffff">She definetly had a seizure.</i></font>

927
01:36:08,290 --> 01:36:11,116
<i><font color="#80ffff">We can rule out toxins.</i></font>

928
01:36:11,117 --> 01:36:14,135
I see that I am not needed here.

929
01:36:14,136 --> 01:36:16,250
You are Tsahik.

930
01:36:16,463 --> 01:36:19,271
Remove these things.

931
01:36:19,272 --> 01:36:21,091
Out! You have done nothing!

932
01:36:21,093 --> 01:36:23,406
Come on, let's just take a break.

933
01:36:23,407 --> 01:36:26,095
Hold on I have to take her IV out.

934
01:36:26,465 --> 01:36:28,078
Tuktirey.

935
01:36:34,847 --> 01:36:40,477
She said she could feel Eywa,
she could hear her heartbeat.

936
01:36:40,478 --> 01:36:44,438
-That is classic frontal lobe epilepsy.
-Epilepsy?

937
01:36:44,439 --> 01:36:47,458
You see visions and experiences religious

938
01:36:47,459 --> 01:36:50,826
ecstasy like the one she described.

939
01:36:57,284 --> 01:37:00,995
Plugging into The Spirit
Tree is some sort of a trigger.

940
01:37:00,996 --> 01:37:04,206
You definetly can't let her do that anymore.

941
01:37:04,207 --> 01:37:06,208
What? Ever?

942
01:37:06,209 --> 01:37:07,877
Jake,

943
01:37:07,878 --> 01:37:10,549
If she seizes underwater again,

944
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:12,950
it could kill her.

945
01:37:20,890 --> 01:37:22,867
Kiri,

946
01:37:23,717 --> 01:37:26,416
You are awake.

947
01:37:30,483 --> 01:37:33,307
Kiri,

948
01:37:33,308 --> 01:37:36,564
Kiri, my sweet child.

949
01:37:36,565 --> 01:37:38,686
My sweet little girl.

950
01:37:38,688 --> 01:37:41,399
Okay this one "I see you."

951
01:37:46,663 --> 01:37:49,661
That's what I just said, isn't it?

952
01:37:50,458 --> 01:37:52,918
Not Naati. Ngaati.

953
01:37:52,919 --> 01:37:57,130
Okay, it's going out through
the nose or something.

954
01:37:57,131 --> 01:38:01,158
Boss, one of the patrols
picked up a radar hit.

955
01:38:01,159 --> 01:38:03,332
A rogue gunship.

956
01:38:03,334 --> 01:38:07,076
-Where?
-Eastern sea, 2 clicks north.

957
01:38:08,850 --> 01:38:10,832
Hang on.

958
01:38:11,936 --> 01:38:15,939
The signal disappeared out over the open sea.

959
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:19,365
But if you project the track,

960
01:38:19,366 --> 01:38:21,945
it hits this island group.

961
01:38:21,946 --> 01:38:24,835
That's hundreds of islands.

962
01:38:24,836 --> 01:38:27,533
That's a big search box. Lots of villages.

963
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:29,554
This is our guy.

964
01:38:29,555 --> 01:38:33,790
Give me ships and aircraft I
will bring you with his scalp.

965
01:38:43,966 --> 01:38:47,359
-Bogeys, inbound.
-Skipper.

966
01:38:53,975 --> 01:38:57,979
-All stop. <i><font color="#80ffff">All stop.</i></font>
-Yes.
-Yes.

967
01:39:16,912 --> 01:39:17,996
-Hey.

968
01:39:17,997 --> 01:39:19,998
Are you Scoresby?

969
01:39:19,999 --> 01:39:23,000
Are you the asshole who's
commandeering my ship?

970
01:39:23,363 --> 01:39:26,365
That would be me.

971
01:39:26,367 --> 01:39:30,007
The target is pretty much
this whole island group.

972
01:39:30,008 --> 01:39:32,773
I've never been up there.

973
01:39:32,774 --> 01:39:36,095
You know those waters Doc.
What kind of indigenous we got?

974
01:39:36,096 --> 01:39:39,724
Metkayina mostly. Some
Ta'unui, maybe 50 villages.

975
01:39:39,725 --> 01:39:42,727
Uh you are? Who?

976
01:39:42,728 --> 01:39:44,841
Ian Garvin,

977
01:39:44,842 --> 01:39:46,674
marine biologist.

978
01:39:46,675 --> 01:39:51,276
50 villages, 100 villages I
don't care we'll search them all.

979
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:53,276
I hunt tulkuns.

980
01:39:53,277 --> 01:39:55,738
That's what I'm rigged
for. That's all my guys do.

981
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:58,366
I have quotas to meet..

982
01:39:58,367 --> 01:40:01,336
I'll be nice once,

983
01:40:01,337 --> 01:40:03,166
and then I won't.

984
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:08,085
If you can't get out of it,

985
01:40:08,086 --> 01:40:10,226
get into it.

986
01:40:10,228 --> 01:40:12,819
All crews at their stations!

987
01:40:12,820 --> 01:40:14,880
Hey, don't touch.

988
01:40:14,882 --> 01:40:17,760
-Now bring her up, flight speed.
-Flight speed.

989
01:40:28,978 --> 01:40:31,526
What was that?

990
01:40:31,527 --> 01:40:33,815
What's going on?

991
01:40:35,195 --> 01:40:37,831
The Tulkuns have returned!

992
01:40:37,832 --> 01:40:40,847
Everybody, our brothers
and sisters have returned.

993
01:40:50,289 --> 01:40:53,448
<i><font color="#80ffff">In their endless cycle of migration.</i></font>

994
01:40:53,449 --> 01:40:56,397
<i><font color="#80ffff">The Tulkun had come home.</i></font>

995
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:04,222
Kiri, come on. Come on.

996
01:41:04,223 --> 01:41:07,742
Tuk, leave me alone.
-¿What?

997
01:41:08,139 --> 01:41:11,446
What do you want?
-Look!

998
01:41:11,447 --> 01:41:13,256
Look!

999
01:41:19,691 --> 01:41:21,509
Come on.

1000
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:23,444
Let's go meet them.

1001
01:41:23,445 --> 01:41:26,603
Look, It's my spirit sister.

1002
01:42:22,499 --> 01:42:26,084
{\an5} Sister, I see you.

1003
01:42:26,085 --> 01:42:28,755
{\an5} I see you, sister. I am happy.

1004
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:38,596
{\an5} Your son is very beautiful.

1005
01:42:38,597 --> 01:42:42,224
{\an5} Thanks. How is your baby?

1006
01:42:42,225 --> 01:42:44,644
{\an5} My baby is strong.

1007
01:42:47,011 --> 01:42:48,689
{\an5} I met a boy.

1008
01:42:48,690 --> 01:42:53,234
<i><font color="#80ffff">It was a time for stories
of their season apart.</i></font>

1009
01:42:53,235 --> 01:42:56,103
<i><font color="#80ffff">Of death and births.</i></font>

1010

1011
01:43:16,090 --> 01:43:18,675
<b> TA'UNUI-VILLAGE</b>

1012
01:43:22,705 --> 01:43:24,706
Be calm.

1013
01:43:24,708 --> 01:43:28,433
We are looking for weapons,
radios, technical equipment.

1014
01:43:29,397 --> 01:43:32,871
Down on your knees!

1015
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:34,875
Shut up!

1016
01:43:37,943 --> 01:43:42,706
{\an5} We know this man resides
somewhere here on the islands.

1017
01:43:42,708 --> 01:43:44,824
{\an5} Here in this village?

1018
01:43:44,825 --> 01:43:48,536
{\an5} We are a totally different clan.

1019
01:43:48,537 --> 01:43:51,705
{\an5} This man in the picture is from the forest.

1020
01:43:51,706 --> 01:43:54,790
-What is he saying?
-They never saw him, these are sea people.

1021
01:43:54,791 --> 01:43:56,626
Forest people don't come here.

1022
01:43:56,627 --> 01:43:59,246
I ain't buying that.

1023
01:44:03,299 --> 01:44:07,303
{\an5} He must search in the
forest if he is to find that man.

1024
01:44:10,014 --> 01:44:12,274
They don't know anything.

1025
01:44:14,434 --> 01:44:17,113
Shoot that animal.

1026
01:44:19,064 --> 01:44:22,334
What the hell are you doing?!

1027
01:44:24,136 --> 01:44:26,247
Noooo!!

1028
01:44:29,532 --> 01:44:31,491
{\an5} Be calm!

1029
01:44:31,492 --> 01:44:33,508
Are your ears working now?

1030
01:44:33,509 --> 01:44:37,501
Now you have seen what these can do huh.

1031
01:44:38,707 --> 01:44:43,044
Jake Sully. Toruk Makto!

1032
01:44:43,045 --> 01:44:45,046
{\an5} He already told you he knows nothing.

1033
01:44:45,047 --> 01:44:47,048
Put her down!

1034
01:44:49,926 --> 01:44:51,176
Stop! Stop!

1035
01:44:51,177 --> 01:44:53,818
You make it real clear for him.

1036
01:44:53,819 --> 01:44:57,057
If he doesn't give up Sully, we'll kill the Tsahik.

1037
01:44:57,058 --> 01:44:59,718
-No, I'm not doing that.
-That right?

1038
01:44:59,719 --> 01:45:03,478
I don't want to be part of this.

1039
01:45:03,479 --> 01:45:07,170
These people don't know anything.

1040
01:45:12,071 --> 01:45:14,072
Are we really going to kill her?

1041
01:45:14,725 --> 01:45:16,815
Please, please

1042
01:45:16,948 --> 01:45:18,903
You must not do that.

1043
01:45:18,904 --> 01:45:21,911
What you are doing here is so wrong!

1044
01:45:21,913 --> 01:45:24,082
Please.

1045
01:45:27,085 --> 01:45:29,756
Burn the hooches.

1046
01:45:29,757 --> 01:45:33,091
-Hey, light them up.
-Light em up!

1047
01:45:45,852 --> 01:45:47,728
{\an5} -I'm sorry.

1048
01:45:47,729 --> 01:45:49,646
{\an5} -I didn't know.

1049
01:45:49,647 --> 01:45:52,232
{\an5} -Stop this madness.

1050
01:45:52,233 --> 01:45:54,100
{\an5}I'm sorry.

1051
01:45:54,101 --> 01:45:56,111
We're out of here.

1052
01:45:56,112 --> 01:45:58,275
Don't touch me!

1053
01:45:58,276 --> 01:45:59,114
I'm sorry.

1054
01:45:59,115 --> 01:46:01,116
-Let's go.
-Saddle up.

1055
01:46:27,098 --> 01:46:30,642
-What's wrong?
-Sky people.

1056
01:46:30,643 --> 01:46:33,685
They're looking for you JakeSully South.

1057
01:46:33,686 --> 01:46:38,052
They have a human boy who speaks Na'vi.

1058
01:46:41,278 --> 01:46:43,748
Did they kill anybody?

1059
01:46:43,749 --> 01:46:46,031
Not yet.

1060
01:46:46,032 --> 01:46:47,757
They threaten,

1061
01:46:47,758 --> 01:46:51,663
but the villagers will not tell
them where you are on my order.

1062
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:01,996
We must hunt this demon.

1063
01:47:01,997 --> 01:47:06,008
Trap him, kill him.

1064
01:47:06,009 --> 01:47:08,677
We've gotta be smart

1065
01:47:08,678 --> 01:47:12,210
If we attack Quaritch, they
are gonna know where we are,

1066
01:47:12,211 --> 01:47:15,558
and they're gonna come
here with everything they got.

1067
01:47:15,559 --> 01:47:18,686
Then what is our plan.

1068
01:47:18,687 --> 01:47:21,956
We are looking for Toruk Makto!

1069
01:47:21,957 --> 01:47:24,326
Has he been here?

1070
01:47:27,696 --> 01:47:30,099
This shit ain't working.

1071
01:47:30,100 --> 01:47:31,739
Nah, they're stone walling us.

1072
01:47:31,740 --> 01:47:34,939
If we turn up the heat he's
just gonna keep running.

1073
01:47:34,941 --> 01:47:37,994
We have to draw him out.

1074
01:47:45,962 --> 01:47:47,846
I'm over it.

1075
01:47:47,847 --> 01:47:50,716
I've got quotas to meet.

1076
01:47:50,717 --> 01:47:52,940
Do you want to hunt?

1077
01:47:52,941 --> 01:47:54,719
Let's hunt.

1078
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:57,722
What? Here? Not here.
There's too many villages.

1079
01:47:57,723 --> 01:48:00,725
No. No no no.

1080
01:48:00,726 --> 01:48:03,198
Respectfully sir. You do not understand the

1081
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:05,896
kindred bonds between the
Tulkun and the ocean Na'vi.

1082
01:48:05,897 --> 01:48:08,732
It would be like murdering
a member of their family.

1083
01:48:08,733 --> 01:48:12,736
If we start hunting here, the
hostiles will come after us.

1084
01:48:12,737 --> 01:48:14,612
Exactly.

1085
01:48:14,613 --> 01:48:17,594
One hostile in particular.

1086
01:48:26,666 --> 01:48:30,710
I know how you feel.

1087
01:48:30,711 --> 01:48:35,757
I feel all alone too.

1088
01:48:35,758 --> 01:48:37,453
Tell me.

1089
01:48:37,454 --> 01:48:40,289
Why are you outcast?

1090
01:51:01,892 --> 01:51:04,563
I am sorry.

1091
01:51:04,564 --> 01:51:06,896
I'm so sorry.

1092
01:51:09,899 --> 01:51:12,902
It is okay.

1093
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:29,339
You allowed this.

1094
01:51:29,708 --> 01:51:34,425
You allowed him to bond with the outcast.

1095
01:51:36,131 --> 01:51:38,303
Tsireya...

1096
01:51:38,304 --> 01:51:41,593
You disappoint me, daughter.

1097
01:51:41,594 --> 01:51:45,109
And you are the son of a great warrior.

1098
01:51:45,110 --> 01:51:46,663
Who has been taught better.

1099
01:51:46,676 --> 01:51:49,386
Payakan saved my life
sir. You don't know him.

1100
01:51:51,401 --> 01:51:53,273
Sit.

1101
01:51:54,148 --> 01:51:56,150
Sit.

1102
01:51:57,901 --> 01:51:59,576
Sit down!

1103
01:52:03,156 --> 01:52:07,159
Hear my words, boy.

1104
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:09,203
In the days of the first songs,

1105
01:52:09,204 --> 01:52:12,163
the tulkuns fought among themselves...

1106
01:52:12,164 --> 01:52:16,375
...for territory and for revenge.

1107
01:52:16,376 --> 01:52:19,058
But they came to believe

1108
01:52:19,059 --> 01:52:21,751
that killing, no matter how justified

1109
01:52:21,753 --> 01:52:24,839
only brings more killing.

1110
01:52:25,885 --> 01:52:29,847
So, killing was forbidden.

1111
01:52:29,849 --> 01:52:33,985
This is the Tulkun way.

1112
01:52:34,101 --> 01:52:36,805
Payakan is a killer

1113
01:52:36,806 --> 01:52:39,730
and so he is outcast.

1114
01:52:39,731 --> 01:52:42,085
I'm sorry sir, but you are wrong.

1115
01:52:42,086 --> 01:52:47,543
Lo'ak; You are speaking to the Olo'eyktan.
-That's enough!

1116
01:52:50,908 --> 01:52:53,533
I know what I know.

1117
01:52:55,704 --> 01:52:58,154
That's enough.

1118
01:52:58,665 --> 01:53:01,525
I'll deal with this one.

1119
01:53:06,422 --> 01:53:09,279
The storm will pass.

1120
01:53:09,550 --> 01:53:11,129
Lo'ak;

1121
01:53:11,130 --> 01:53:13,469
I saw something today.

1122
01:53:13,470 --> 01:53:17,515
I saw a forest boy chosen by Tulkun.

1123
01:53:17,516 --> 01:53:20,226
I am very proud of you.

1124
01:53:20,227 --> 01:53:22,779
Payakan didn't kill those boys.

1125
01:53:22,780 --> 01:53:24,229
I saw it all.

1126
01:53:24,230 --> 01:53:26,119
The demon ship killed his mother right in

1127
01:53:26,120 --> 01:53:28,233
front of him, so he
gathered the young bulls

1128
01:53:28,234 --> 01:53:31,214
and the reef boys
together to attack the ship,

1129
01:53:31,215 --> 01:53:33,237
and they were all killed.

1130
01:53:33,238 --> 01:53:36,448
But by the Sky People
not by him. He's not a killer.

1131
01:53:36,449 --> 01:53:41,245
No, Lo'ak, By the Tulkun way
he is, he bears those deaths.

1132
01:53:41,246 --> 01:53:43,870
Will he have to pay for
it for the rest of his life?

1133
01:53:43,872 --> 01:53:47,762
He knows what he did was
wrong. He would never do it again.

1134
01:53:47,764 --> 01:53:50,380
-We must tell my father...
-No, no.

1135
01:53:50,381 --> 01:53:53,542
-I'm in enough trouble with my dad already.
-Your father will understand.

1136
01:53:53,543 --> 01:53:56,592
No. He won't. He doesn't understand anything.

1137
01:53:56,593 --> 01:53:58,982
The whole clan hates me.

1138
01:53:58,983 --> 01:54:02,878
Demon blood, alien. That's all they see.

1139
01:54:07,437 --> 01:54:10,895
I see you.

1140
01:54:14,276 --> 01:54:18,241
You are brother of Tulkun.

1141
01:54:18,613 --> 01:54:22,362
You are one of us now.

1142
01:54:37,068 --> 01:54:38,984
You got my mother?

1143
01:54:38,985 --> 01:54:41,800
Mother and the calf,
strong signal, range 4000.

1144
01:54:41,934 --> 01:54:44,415
Bring it down in the hull.

1145
01:54:44,416 --> 01:54:46,793
Coming down on it.

1146
01:55:08,576 --> 01:55:11,995
Sub teams, two minutes!
Let's do this. Let's get in there.

1147
01:55:11,996 --> 01:55:14,038
<i><font color="#80ffff">Hatches closed.</i></font>

1148
01:55:14,039 --> 01:55:16,082
Come on! Hustle! Hustle!

1149
01:55:16,083 --> 01:55:18,905
Crews to their boats! 2 minutes;

1150
01:55:18,906 --> 01:55:20,628
Let's make some bang.

1151
01:55:20,629 --> 01:55:22,914
Boat crew.

1152
01:55:22,915 --> 01:55:24,382
Get ready.

1153
01:55:30,096 --> 01:55:32,348
All boats in!

1154
01:55:36,351 --> 01:55:38,353
Go!

1155
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:51,395
We're rolling.

1156
01:56:16,388 --> 01:56:20,392
Standby, depth charges in. Fire! Fire! Fire!

1157
01:56:42,412 --> 01:56:44,830
What's that? What are they doing?

1158
01:56:44,831 --> 01:56:49,417
There are echolocation
sensors, with which they navigate.

1159
01:56:49,418 --> 01:56:53,421
They keep them afloat so they don't go deaf.

1160
01:56:53,422 --> 01:56:55,113
Picadors,

1161
01:56:55,114 --> 01:56:57,426
Get in there!

1162
01:57:13,523 --> 01:57:16,035
They're gonna cut the
cow from the rest of the pod

1163
01:57:16,036 --> 01:57:17,943
using the sound cannon.

1164
01:57:17,944 --> 01:57:21,003
They target the mother
because the calf swims slowly

1165
01:57:21,004 --> 01:57:23,448
and she won't leave the calf.

1166
01:57:23,449 --> 01:57:25,513
Do they ever fight back?

1167
01:57:25,514 --> 01:57:28,234
No, never seen 'em lift a fin.

1168
01:57:28,236 --> 01:57:31,273
Tough bastards to kill though.

1169
01:57:31,275 --> 01:57:34,404
Submarine teams, go!

1170
01:57:45,011 --> 01:57:49,097
-There we have the lady.
-Target in sight. Harpoons ready.

1171
01:57:49,098 --> 01:57:51,766
Here we go baby.

1172
01:57:51,808 --> 01:57:54,451
So we go in from below,

1173
01:57:54,452 --> 01:57:57,131
where there's gaps in the armor.

1174
01:57:59,170 --> 01:58:00,653
All right, lets go.

1175
01:58:00,655 --> 01:58:04,659
-Okay, that's it now.
-Get me really close.

1176
01:58:07,490 --> 01:58:10,491
-Hold it steady.
-Arm one.

1177
01:58:10,492 --> 01:58:13,017
Armed.

1178
01:58:13,018 --> 01:58:15,496
And... rolling!

1179
01:58:20,530 --> 01:58:22,151
Arm one

1180
01:58:23,275 --> 01:58:24,600
Fire!

1181
01:58:27,508 --> 01:58:29,677
-Good strike.
-Arm two.

1182
01:58:31,512 --> 01:58:34,872
Booyah!

1183
01:58:34,873 --> 01:58:37,902
3-6, you owe us a beer.

1184
01:58:40,145 --> 01:58:45,524
The bags slow her down and
pull her up towards the surface.

1185
01:58:45,525 --> 01:58:50,528
Bring me closer! Very close. 30 meters.

1186
01:58:50,796 --> 01:58:53,531
Explosive tarpoon

1187
01:58:53,532 --> 01:58:56,923
10 meters. Get me all the way in there.

1188
01:58:56,925 --> 01:59:01,930
Keep the boat steady! Hold, hold on.

1189
01:59:10,923 --> 01:59:14,971
Hold on to your ponytail, Colonel.

1190
01:59:23,559 --> 01:59:26,562
-Full power back!
-Yes.

1191
01:59:33,569 --> 01:59:35,570
Hold her!

1192
01:59:38,573 --> 01:59:42,017
She takes an explosive harpoon to the chest,

1193
01:59:42,018 --> 01:59:44,982
but she keeps running.

1194
01:59:44,983 --> 01:59:47,148
Beautiful.

1195
02:00:59,647 --> 02:01:02,900
We can only get to the gland from below,

1196
02:01:02,901 --> 02:01:05,867
so we drill up through the palate

1197
02:01:05,869 --> 02:01:08,872
and into the brain.

1198
02:01:11,408 --> 02:01:15,411
These are highly intelligent
beings. Probably smarter than us.

1199
02:01:15,412 --> 02:01:18,664
-Not smarter than me.
-Then the bar is set low.

1200
02:01:18,665 --> 02:01:21,667
I'm the one with the harpoon.

1201
02:01:21,668 --> 02:01:23,614
And yes.

1202
02:01:33,679 --> 02:01:36,014
How do you know they are smarter than us?

1203
02:01:36,015 --> 02:01:39,486
They have more neurons, more pathways.

1204
02:01:39,528 --> 02:01:43,687
Not only are they smarter,
but also deeply emotional.

1205
02:01:43,688 --> 02:01:45,690
More spiritual.

1206
02:01:48,692 --> 02:01:52,695
The area here corresponds
to our emotional center,

1207
02:01:52,696 --> 02:01:56,463
but is proportionally much larger.

1208
02:01:56,465 --> 02:02:01,161
They have music, philosophy, mathematics

1209
02:02:01,187 --> 02:02:03,705
and a complex language.

1210
02:02:03,706 --> 02:02:05,244
Okay,

1211
02:02:05,245 --> 02:02:06,914
Here we go.

1212
02:02:06,915 --> 02:02:09,617
Show me the money.

1213
02:02:12,714 --> 02:02:15,808
So that's what this is all about?

1214
02:02:15,809 --> 02:02:17,687
That's it.

1215
02:02:17,688 --> 02:02:19,828
Amrita.

1216
02:02:20,722 --> 02:02:23,283
Bad luck for the big guys.

1217
02:02:23,284 --> 02:02:25,892
This stuff just happens to stop human aging.

1218
02:02:25,893 --> 02:02:28,187
Like stops it

1219
02:02:30,731 --> 02:02:36,735
Ounce for ounce, the single most
valuable substance known to man.

1220
02:02:36,736 --> 02:02:42,324
This little vial here is
worth like 80 million.

1221
02:02:42,325 --> 02:02:44,743
Think fast!

1222
02:02:44,744 --> 02:02:47,746
Please, don't; It's never funny.

1223
02:02:47,747 --> 02:02:52,750
Amrita is what's paying for
everything here on Pandora now.

1224
02:02:52,996 --> 02:02:56,145
Even your research, Dr. G.

1225
02:02:56,146 --> 02:02:58,424
That's why I drink.

1226
02:02:59,382 --> 02:03:01,323
That's all you take?

1227
02:03:01,324 --> 02:03:04,761
You just waste the rest?

1228
02:03:04,762 --> 02:03:06,919
Drop the bags.

1229
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:08,765
Let's sink her.

1230
02:03:08,766 --> 02:03:12,264
No, leave the bags alone.

1231
02:03:12,265 --> 02:03:13,769
I want them to know it was us.

1232
02:03:13,770 --> 02:03:17,744
I charge extra for being used as bait.

1233
02:03:51,805 --> 02:03:55,808
Her name is Ro'a.

1234
02:03:55,809 --> 02:03:58,812
She was my spirit sister.

1235
02:04:00,939 --> 02:04:04,816
She was the composer of songs.

1236
02:04:04,817 --> 02:04:08,820
Much revened, we would sing together.

1237
02:04:08,821 --> 02:04:13,248
She waited many breeding
cycles to have this calf.

1238
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:17,069
The clan was so happy for her.

1239
02:04:18,538 --> 02:04:21,510
What's is this, Tonowari?

1240
02:04:22,834 --> 02:04:26,171
What is this?!!

1241
02:04:44,436 --> 02:04:47,595
My spirit sister and her baby

1242
02:04:47,596 --> 02:04:51,442
have been murdered by the sky people.

1243
02:04:51,443 --> 02:04:54,319
The war has come to us!

1244
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:57,447
<i><font color="#80ffff">We knew about this
hunting of our tulkun people</i></font>

1245
02:04:57,448 --> 02:05:00,825
but it was over the horizon far away.

1246
02:05:00,972 --> 02:05:04,273
Now it is here!

1247
02:05:06,457 --> 02:05:09,876
You have to understand
how the sky people think.

1248
02:05:09,877 --> 02:05:13,462
They don't care about the great balance.

1249
02:05:13,463 --> 02:05:15,464
Now listen to him.

1250
02:05:15,465 --> 02:05:17,800
The Sky People are not gonna
stop. This is only the beginning.

1251
02:05:17,801 --> 02:05:21,178
You've got to tell your Tulkuns to leave.

1252
02:05:21,179 --> 02:05:23,471
You gotta tell them to go far away!

1253
02:05:23,472 --> 02:05:25,973
Leave?

1254
02:05:25,974 --> 02:05:28,392
You live among us,

1255
02:05:28,393 --> 02:05:30,144
and you learned nothing.

1256
02:05:30,145 --> 02:05:33,480
We will fight to protect
our brothers and sisters!

1257
02:05:33,481 --> 02:05:36,483
No no no.

1258
02:05:36,484 --> 02:05:39,278
If you attack, if you fight.

1259
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:41,237
Then they will destroy you.

1260
02:05:41,238 --> 02:05:44,199
They will destroy everything that you love.

1261
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:47,493
Hear my words! Hear my words!

1262
02:05:47,494 --> 02:05:50,496
Stay calm!

1263
02:05:50,497 --> 02:05:53,001
-Now listen to my father.
-Damn it.

1264
02:05:53,002 --> 02:05:56,188
He speaks the truth.

1265
02:06:03,509 --> 02:06:06,511
Tell the tulkuns,

1266
02:06:06,512 --> 02:06:10,015
that if they are hit by one of
these, they are marked for death.

1267
02:06:12,851 --> 02:06:17,521
Call for me and I'll silence it.

1268
02:06:17,522 --> 02:06:21,275
Saving their lives, that's
all that matters, right?

1269
02:06:24,153 --> 02:06:26,530
Saving your family.

1270
02:06:38,541 --> 02:06:41,543
Tell the Tulkun.

1271
02:06:41,544 --> 02:06:44,115
Go. Go.

1272
02:06:47,549 --> 02:06:50,343
We must fight.

1273
02:06:50,344 --> 02:06:52,031
MaJake...

1274
02:06:52,032 --> 02:06:54,555
I will not stand and do nothing.

1275
02:06:54,556 --> 02:06:56,415
It's a trap, they want us to hit back.

1276
02:06:56,505 --> 02:06:59,631
They aren't hunting Tulkuns.

1277
02:06:59,632 --> 02:07:02,223
They are hunting us.

1278
02:07:15,325 --> 02:07:17,386
You're not going anywhere, little brother.

1279
02:07:17,387 --> 02:07:19,578
I have to warn Payakan.

1280
02:07:19,579 --> 02:07:22,580
No. You've got to keep your skxawng ass here.

1281
02:07:22,581 --> 02:07:25,708
He is outcast. There's no
one else to warn him but me.

1282
02:07:25,709 --> 02:07:27,478
Bro;

1283
02:07:27,779 --> 02:07:30,264
Why do you always have
to make things so hard.

1284
02:07:31,590 --> 02:07:35,125
No, you mean why can't
I be perfect son like you?

1285
02:07:35,809 --> 02:07:38,887
The perfect little soldier.

1286
02:07:38,888 --> 02:07:41,137
Well I'm not you!,

1287
02:07:41,138 --> 02:07:42,599
Okay?

1288
02:07:42,600 --> 02:07:44,227
I'm not you.

1289
02:07:44,228 --> 02:07:47,603
He's my brother. I'm going.

1290
02:07:47,604 --> 02:07:51,607
Is he your brother? No, I'm your brother.

1291
02:07:51,608 --> 02:07:53,609
Lo'ak!

1292
02:07:53,610 --> 02:07:55,611
Let go of me.

1293
02:07:55,612 --> 02:07:57,422
Lo'ak!

1294
02:07:57,423 --> 02:08:00,125
Come on, he's going to Payakan.

1295
02:08:11,376 --> 02:08:13,461
Come back!

1296
02:08:13,462 --> 02:08:16,630
-There's Lo'ak.
-Loak!

1297
02:08:16,631 --> 02:08:20,926
-He's going to find Payakan.
-Wait up.

1298
02:08:20,927 --> 02:08:23,093
Hold on.

1299
02:08:30,644 --> 02:08:33,877
All crews to stations.

1300
02:08:33,878 --> 02:08:36,857
Come, let's make some money

1301
02:08:42,655 --> 02:08:45,656
Payakan! Brother!

1302
02:08:45,657 --> 02:08:46,658
Lo'ak!

1303
02:08:48,410 --> 02:08:50,442
-Lo'ak!
-Wait!

1304
02:08:53,665 --> 02:08:56,667
What's wrong?

1305
02:08:56,668 --> 02:08:58,627
Shit!

1306
02:08:58,628 --> 02:09:01,311
Stay calm; Stay calm.

1307
02:09:01,312 --> 02:09:03,958
I got this.

1308
02:09:08,679 --> 02:09:10,680
Shit!

1309
02:09:12,682 --> 02:09:13,682
Lo'ak!

1310
02:09:13,683 --> 02:09:17,687
Bro, help me! Hurry the ships coming.

1311
02:09:20,064 --> 02:09:22,234
Bro, come on.

1312
02:09:23,692 --> 02:09:25,693
Come on bro.

1313
02:09:25,694 --> 02:09:29,697
Call Dad! Call Dad! Just go, do it.

1314
02:09:29,698 --> 02:09:31,365
-Don't go, wait!

1315
02:09:31,366 --> 02:09:33,700
-Dad... I mean Devil Dog. Do you read me?

1316
02:09:33,701 --> 02:09:36,703
-Did you see where they went?
-Outside the reef.

1317
02:09:36,704 --> 02:09:38,705
-Lo'ak?
-Yes.

1318
02:09:38,706 --> 02:09:41,917
We are with a tulkun who is under attack.

1319
02:09:41,918 --> 02:09:43,710
Gunships inbound.

1320
02:09:43,711 --> 02:09:46,504
-It is 2 clicks out.
-Who is with you?

1321
02:09:46,505 --> 02:09:49,715
All of us, Ao'nung and Tsireya
too. We're at Three Brothers Rocks

1322
02:09:49,716 --> 02:09:52,087
Get to cover and do not engage. Alright?

1323
02:09:52,088 --> 02:09:54,595
You hear me? Do not engage. We are coming.

1324
02:09:54,596 --> 02:09:56,555
-Yes, sir.
-It's getting closer!

1325
02:09:56,556 --> 02:09:59,724
3, 2, Pull!

1326
02:09:59,725 --> 02:10:01,900
The kids are under attack.

1327
02:10:01,901 --> 02:10:04,729
They're defending a
tulkun. It's your kids too.

1328
02:10:04,730 --> 02:10:06,523
-The Demon Ship?
-Yes!

1329
02:10:06,524 --> 02:10:07,732
We gotta go!

1330
02:10:07,733 --> 02:10:10,735
Weapons! Sound the alarm!

1331
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:16,356
-You should stay back.
-I'll ride!

1332
02:11:06,787 --> 02:11:11,142
Submarines, close the hatches! Two minutes!

1333
02:11:16,796 --> 02:11:19,798
-Ao'nung!
-Hurry up bro!

1334
02:11:19,799 --> 02:11:21,932
Bro, hurry up.

1335
02:11:23,594 --> 02:11:25,616
Go! Go! Go!

1336
02:11:28,807 --> 02:11:30,794
Take it off!

1337
02:11:31,810 --> 02:11:33,987
All at the same time!

1338
02:11:36,814 --> 02:11:39,858
I'll be damned.

1339
02:11:39,882 --> 02:11:41,866
Sully's kids.

1340
02:11:41,868 --> 02:11:44,364
Let's roll. Not you.

1341
02:11:44,365 --> 02:11:46,541
Saddle up.

1342
02:11:56,833 --> 02:11:59,835
<i><font color="#80ffff">700 meters. The signal is clear.</i></font>

1343

-Pull harder!
-Pull!

1344
02:12:07,843 --> 02:12:11,262
-It came out!
-Go, Tuk.

1345
02:12:11,263 --> 02:12:13,102
Come on! Get out of here.

1346
02:12:13,103 --> 02:12:14,807
Go that way I'll draw them out.

1347
02:12:14,808 --> 02:12:16,975
-Okay.
-Lo'ak, come.

1348
02:12:16,976 --> 02:12:19,853
Payakan, go! Go!

1349
02:12:19,854 --> 02:12:22,523
Tuk, grab on!

1350

-300 meters.
-Depth charges ready.

1351
02:12:35,403 --> 02:12:39,011
Fire! Fire! Fire!

1352
02:12:42,875 --> 02:12:44,795
No depth charges.

1353
02:12:44,796 --> 02:12:47,878
The kids are worthless to me dead.

1354
02:12:47,879 --> 02:12:49,927
Hold your fire.

1355
02:12:54,886 --> 02:12:59,389
Circle them. Launch the submarines.

1356
02:12:59,390 --> 02:13:01,892
Sub teams, get wet.

1357
02:13:50,937 --> 02:13:52,939
Crabs, turn right.

1358
02:13:56,943 --> 02:13:59,944
-Don't lose them, stay on them.
-Blades up, I'm going in.

1359
02:13:59,945 --> 02:14:01,947
Oh hell yeah!

1360
02:14:32,976 --> 02:14:34,977
On lock.

1361
02:15:04,004 --> 02:15:07,617
Where is Tuk? Did you see her?

1362
02:15:23,022 --> 02:15:25,028
Tuk!

1363
02:15:26,024 --> 02:15:28,671
Target in sight.

1364
02:15:31,660 --> 02:15:33,667
It is coming!

1365
02:15:33,669 --> 02:15:35,665
We have to go!

1368
02:16:16,070 --> 02:16:19,384
Beware! Move your hand!

1369
02:16:19,385 --> 02:16:21,417
Hurry up!

1370
02:16:24,620 --> 02:16:27,380

Stay down.

Hey, hey! What are you doing stop!

1377

Stop! Don't hurt them!

1378
02:16:51,102 --> 02:16:52,102
Stop moving!

1379

-Spider
-Bro, are you okay?

1380
02:16:54,731 --> 02:16:58,375
Yeah, great cuz, never better.

1381
02:17:04,114 --> 02:17:06,278
Get back to the bridge.

1382
02:17:06,279 --> 02:17:08,117
Keep him there!

1383
02:17:08,118 --> 02:17:10,536
I'm going, I'm going.

1384
02:17:10,537 --> 02:17:12,750
Yeah, I remember you.

1385
02:17:12,751 --> 02:17:15,624
Cuff them to the rail, all of them.

1386
02:17:15,625 --> 02:17:17,125
-Let's go.

1387
02:17:17,126 --> 02:17:19,002
Let's go, move.

1388
02:17:19,003 --> 02:17:21,504
-Over here.
-Watch them they bite.

1389
02:17:21,505 --> 02:17:23,131
Get on your knees.

1390
02:17:23,132 --> 02:17:26,133
Give me your hand.

1391
02:17:26,134 --> 02:17:28,136
Now the other.

1392
02:17:31,431 --> 02:17:33,191
Be brave.

1393
02:17:37,144 --> 02:17:39,396

Stop! Stop them!

1397
02:17:51,658 --> 02:17:53,537
It's Sully.

1398
02:17:55,370 --> 02:17:57,101
300 yards.

1399
02:18:02,877 --> 02:18:05,322
They have our children. Your daughter,

1400
02:18:05,323 --> 02:18:06,881
Tuk, Lo'ak...

1401
02:18:09,883 --> 02:18:13,886
Jake, tell your friends to back off.

1402
02:18:13,887 --> 02:18:18,892
If you want your children,
you will come forward alone.

1403
02:18:20,893 --> 02:18:24,687
You know better than to test my result.

1404
02:18:27,900 --> 02:18:30,627
I took you under my wing, Jake,

1405
02:18:30,628 --> 02:18:32,903
and you betrayed me.

1406
02:18:32,904 --> 02:18:34,803
You killed your own.

1407
02:18:34,804 --> 02:18:36,557
Good men and women.

1408
02:18:36,558 --> 02:18:40,368
I will not hesitate to execute your kid.

1409
02:18:40,369 --> 02:18:42,658
Just wait one.

1410
02:18:52,923 --> 02:18:54,924
Hold here.

1411
02:18:54,925 --> 02:18:57,477
They are killers of Tulkun.

1412
02:18:57,478 --> 02:19:00,929
They must die. Here, today.

1413
02:19:00,930 --> 02:19:04,541
It's me that they want. That's
what all this has been about right.

1414
02:19:04,543 --> 02:19:08,460
The hunting Tulkuns and taking of our kids.

1415
02:19:09,938 --> 02:19:12,356
You brought this upon us!

1416
02:19:12,614 --> 02:19:14,738
You!

1417
02:19:16,945 --> 02:19:20,526
Then, it is me who has to do this.

1418
02:19:24,952 --> 02:19:28,955
Offers fixing to expire. What will it be?

1419
02:19:28,956 --> 02:19:31,491
Check your fire.

1420
02:19:31,492 --> 02:19:33,857
I am coming out.

1421
02:19:42,969 --> 02:19:45,970
MaJake, what's happening?

1422

Stay tense everybody. All weapons.

1424

-Easy shot.
-You hit him now, they attack.

1425
02:20:15,289 --> 02:20:18,154
Wait until he's on board.

1426
02:20:44,025 --> 02:20:46,026
Payakan!

1427
02:20:57,037 --> 02:20:59,625
Open fire! Open fire!

Brother!

1429

Come about!
Get me round.

1430
02:21:10,048 --> 02:21:12,686
Get me a shot!

1431
02:21:12,687 --> 02:21:14,796
Now, now!

1432
02:21:32,944 --> 02:21:36,072
Switching rounds; Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

1433
02:21:37,865 --> 02:21:41,077
Get in there. Go! Go! Go!

1434
02:21:49,084 --> 02:21:51,086
Down!

1435

Bloody hell.

Open fire! Open fire!

1437
02:22:05,599 --> 02:22:08,569
Sully's inbound Keep an eye on him.

1438
02:22:08,571 --> 02:22:11,574
Come on, sit up!

1439
02:22:52,142 --> 02:22:55,801
Somebody shoot something!

1440
02:23:10,159 --> 02:23:12,601
Stop!

1441
02:24:07,211 --> 02:24:09,213
After them!

1442
02:24:25,227 --> 02:24:29,231
Leak! Masks on!

1443
02:25:08,267 --> 02:25:10,269
Get him out!

1444
02:25:30,287 --> 02:25:32,462
Go, go, go!!

1445
02:25:44,300 --> 02:25:48,302
-Damage report?
-Rooms 2 and 3 are under water.

1446
02:25:48,303 --> 02:25:50,152
Are you ok?

1447
02:26:19,332 --> 02:26:21,689
Port for the bow!

1448
02:26:21,690 --> 02:26:23,334
Hard to port!

1449

Got you!

1451

Get us away!

1452
02:26:46,702 --> 02:26:48,357
Not responding.

1453
02:26:48,358 --> 02:26:50,459
Cut the cable!

1454
02:26:50,460 --> 02:26:53,377
Who has the harpoon now?

1455

Full power behind!

1456

Let the harpoon!

No cable, you idiot!

1458

We are wrecked.

1459

Take your water pumps on.

1460

Man your weapons!

1461
02:27:23,391 --> 02:27:28,394
-Otherwise, I thought you were so clever.
-Close the food gap, Garvin.

1462
02:27:28,395 --> 02:27:32,398
Where did you go, you cunning satan?

1463
02:27:32,399 --> 02:27:36,877
You probably think you're cunning, huh?

1464
02:27:50,415 --> 02:27:52,616
Because!

1465
02:28:03,427 --> 02:28:06,429
-The pumps don't working
-All men aboard!

1466
02:28:06,430 --> 02:28:10,521
Get him on board a boat! Hurry up, guys!

1467
02:28:15,438 --> 02:28:19,441
-Neteyam!
-Do you need help, little brother?

1468
02:28:19,442 --> 02:28:22,445
Now clap in and cut us free.

1469
02:28:24,445 --> 02:28:28,448
-Get Tuk out of here.
-Hurry up!

1470
02:28:28,450 --> 02:28:30,426
Who is the mighty warrior?
-Come on;

1471
02:28:30,427 --> 02:28:32,263
Say it.

1472
02:28:32,264 --> 02:28:35,124
Come on, lets go!

1473
02:28:35,288 --> 02:28:37,289
Lo'ak!

1474
02:28:37,467 --> 02:28:40,822
They have Spider.

1475
02:28:40,824 --> 02:28:42,075
Come on bro;

1476
02:28:42,077 --> 02:28:44,164
We have to save him.

1477
02:28:50,235 --> 02:28:52,237
Let go of me!

1478
02:28:54,474 --> 02:28:55,475
No!

1479
02:28:57,477 --> 02:28:58,478
Look!

1480
02:29:04,816 --> 02:29:07,423
Let's go buttercup, get up.

1481
02:29:07,424 --> 02:29:09,362
I'm not your buttercup, you perv.

1482
02:29:09,363 --> 02:29:12,489
-We've got to go back for her.
-Tuk, wait!

1483
02:29:12,490 --> 02:29:15,493
Sully's stick together.

1484
02:29:25,502 --> 02:29:31,006
Wait, wait! Ready for departure!

1485
02:29:31,007 --> 02:29:34,584
-Check your mask, make sure it's tight.
-I'm good dumbass.

1486
02:29:36,342 --> 02:29:39,387
Move, move! Come on, people!

1487
02:29:43,018 --> 02:29:44,545
Tuk;

1488
02:29:44,546 --> 02:29:47,464
This is not a good idea. Tuk.

1489
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:09,474
Cut here.

1490
02:30:09,475 --> 02:30:11,574
Come on.

1491
02:30:18,051 --> 02:30:20,235
<i><font color="#80ffff">I got her.</i></font>

1492
02:30:26,224 --> 02:30:27,599
We can still get this done.

1493
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:28,892
Hell yeah.

1494
02:30:28,893 --> 02:30:32,538
I can't believe I'm tied up again!

1495
02:30:57,795 --> 02:31:00,273
-Come on bro.
-Let's go.

1496
02:31:03,800 --> 02:31:06,206
Thanks, guys.

1497
02:31:06,970 --> 02:31:08,805
Go!
No!

1498
02:31:09,053 --> 02:31:11,891
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go!

1499
02:31:14,894 --> 02:31:17,115
Give me that.

1500
02:31:19,815 --> 02:31:21,283
Go, go go!

1501
02:31:21,285 --> 02:31:23,234
This way!

1502
02:31:29,824 --> 02:31:31,864
Take cover!

1503
02:31:36,831 --> 02:31:38,833
See them?

1504
02:31:49,259 --> 02:31:51,844
Bro, that was insane, cuz.

1505
02:31:56,849 --> 02:31:59,559
-Get on!
-Come on bro.

1506
02:31:59,560 --> 02:32:01,269
You skxawng.

1507
02:32:01,270 --> 02:32:03,362
I am shot.

1508
02:32:05,357 --> 02:32:07,396
Shit!

1509
02:32:07,397 --> 02:32:08,902
Give me a hand!

1510
02:32:11,780 --> 02:32:14,278
-Keep him up!
-I got him.

1511
02:32:17,910 --> 02:32:20,370
-Grab him.
-Bro, I got him.

1512
02:32:20,929 --> 02:32:23,932
-Holy shit.
-Hold him up!

1513
02:32:24,771 --> 02:32:26,375
Bro, come on.

1514
02:32:26,376 --> 02:32:31,087
-It's okay bro, I got you.
-Go, go, go!

1515
02:32:31,088 --> 02:32:33,674
They have Kiri and Tuk.

1516
02:32:33,675 --> 02:32:36,208
I can't go back.

1517
02:32:42,433 --> 02:32:45,935
Dad! Help! It's Neteyam!

1518
02:32:45,936 --> 02:32:47,650
Hurry!

1519
02:32:47,651 --> 02:32:49,861
Here take him.

1520
02:32:50,440 --> 02:32:53,442
It's Neteyam, he's hurt! Shit, bro.

1521
02:32:53,443 --> 02:32:55,445
Hurry please!

1522
02:32:58,948 --> 02:33:01,727
Bro watch his head. Watch his head.

1523
02:33:02,159 --> 02:33:03,160
Come on.

1524
02:33:06,455 --> 02:33:08,655
Just watch his head.

1525
02:33:09,999 --> 02:33:12,585
-It's okay, bro, we've got you.
-Oh no.

1526
02:33:15,088 --> 02:33:17,215
Pressure. Get pressure on it.

1527
02:33:19,049 --> 02:33:21,645
-Dad...
-I'm here.

1528
02:33:23,386 --> 02:33:26,389
No, no, no, no.

1529
02:33:32,228 --> 02:33:35,146
I want to go home.

1530
02:33:35,147 --> 02:33:39,151
I know, I know, we're going home.

1531
02:33:42,995 --> 02:33:44,890
It's okay, it's okay.

1532
02:33:44,892 --> 02:33:46,927
-Dad, I_

1533
02:33:52,705 --> 02:33:54,691
Neteyam.

1534
02:33:59,294 --> 02:34:01,838
No, no, no...

1535
02:34:01,839 --> 02:34:03,418
Neteyam!!

1536
02:34:09,387 --> 02:34:14,474
Neteyam! No, great mother...
No, great mother...

1537
02:34:14,475 --> 02:34:17,029
Please!

1538
02:34:17,686 --> 02:34:20,688
Oh, my son! My son!

1539
02:34:20,689 --> 02:34:22,783
No!!

1540
02:34:27,654 --> 02:34:29,875
My son!

1541
02:34:38,122 --> 02:34:41,477
<i><font color="#80ffff">Can you hear me, Corporal?</i></font>

1542
02:34:42,376 --> 02:34:46,128
<i><font color="#80ffff">Yeah. I think you can.</i></font>

1543
02:34:46,129 --> 02:34:48,487
<i><font color="#80ffff">I got your daughters.</i></font>

1544
02:34:50,091 --> 02:34:52,459
<i><font color="#80ffff">Same deal as before.</i></font>

1545
02:34:53,219 --> 02:34:55,470
You ,for them.

1546
02:34:59,642 --> 02:35:02,107
Where are your sisters?

1547
02:35:02,811 --> 02:35:05,479
Your sisters! Where are they?!

1548
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:07,148
-I do not know.
-Where are they?!

1549
02:35:07,149 --> 02:35:09,775
-On the ship. They are tied up on the ship.

1550
02:35:09,776 --> 02:35:12,045
They are at the moonpool.

1551
02:35:12,046 --> 02:35:13,987
On the well deck, amidships.

1552
02:35:13,988 --> 02:35:17,240
-What?
-Come, I'll show you.

1553
02:35:17,241 --> 02:35:20,229
Answer me, Corporal.

1554
02:35:20,230 --> 02:35:23,996
Spit it out or there will be consequences.

1555
02:35:23,997 --> 02:35:26,373
I have heard you.

1556
02:35:26,374 --> 02:35:30,084
Come on, we have to go.

1557
02:35:30,085 --> 02:35:32,546
Come on.

1558
02:35:32,547 --> 02:35:35,450
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1559
02:35:36,258 --> 02:35:38,310
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1560
02:35:38,311 --> 02:35:40,178
They have our daughters.

1561
02:35:40,179 --> 02:35:41,972
They have our daughters.

1562
02:35:44,265 --> 02:35:47,622
I need you with me

1563
02:35:47,623 --> 02:35:50,139
and I need you to be strong.

1564
02:35:50,141 --> 02:35:52,254
Right now.

1565
02:35:52,256 --> 02:35:53,561
Strongheart.

1566
02:35:54,615 --> 02:35:56,158
Strongheart.

1567
02:36:09,038 --> 02:36:11,290
Let's go get our daughters.

1568
02:36:25,470 --> 02:36:27,959
Stay with your brother.

1569
02:36:27,960 --> 02:36:30,103
I want to go with you.

1570
02:36:31,309 --> 02:36:34,181
You have done enough.

1571
02:36:34,182 --> 02:36:36,203
Dad...

1572
02:36:38,732 --> 02:36:41,317
Hold fire.

1573
02:36:41,318 --> 02:36:43,110
Let's go.

1574
02:36:43,111 --> 02:36:45,038
He's coming.

1575
02:36:46,281 --> 02:36:48,582
I'm good, go, go!

1576
02:36:49,325 --> 02:36:53,312
Let's get this guy. That's
why we came here for.

1577
02:36:57,124 --> 02:37:00,334
-Stay with him.
-No!

1578
02:37:00,335 --> 02:37:03,399
Be careful, guys.

1579
02:37:23,356 --> 02:37:25,382
Go.

1580
02:37:32,364 --> 02:37:34,407
-Where are they?
-The middle deck.

1581
02:37:34,408 --> 02:37:37,610
There is like a pool in the center.

1582
02:37:37,611 --> 02:37:40,332
They are at the fort railing.

1583
02:37:41,373 --> 02:37:44,117
No, no; Stay here.

1584
02:37:45,711 --> 02:37:47,925
Talk to me, Corporal.

1585
02:37:47,926 --> 02:37:51,228
The ship is sinking and your
girls are going down with it.

1586
02:37:52,342 --> 02:37:54,606
Your son didn't have to die.

1587
02:37:54,607 --> 02:37:57,151
It was your own fault.

1588
02:38:02,392 --> 02:38:07,467
You thought you could protect
your family, but you can't.

1589
02:38:08,231 --> 02:38:11,580
Only one way to keep em safe.

1590
02:38:13,611 --> 02:38:17,805
So let's get this over with
before you lose another kid.

1591
02:38:28,416 --> 02:38:31,036
Get down!

1592
02:39:12,581 --> 02:39:14,457
-Who is affected?
-Zdinarsik, copy?

1593
02:39:14,458 --> 02:39:16,418
Clear.

1594
02:39:16,419 --> 02:39:20,004
Prague, are you there?

1595
02:39:20,005 --> 02:39:21,423
Look up!

1596
02:39:30,432 --> 02:39:31,474
Forward!

1597
02:39:33,475 --> 02:39:35,435
To the left!

1598
02:39:35,436 --> 02:39:36,727
To the right. Surround her.

1599
02:39:36,728 --> 02:39:38,967
Who's got eyes.

1600
02:40:23,730 --> 02:40:25,749
MaJake!

1601
02:40:30,528 --> 02:40:32,653
It's mother!

1602
02:40:38,535 --> 02:40:40,465
That's right.

1603
02:40:40,466 --> 02:40:42,944
They are coming for you.

1604
02:41:32,585 --> 02:41:33,961
Dad, dad!

1605
02:41:37,423 --> 02:41:40,269
Where is your sister?
Where is she? Where is she?

1606
02:41:40,271 --> 02:41:41,556
That way.

1607
02:41:41,558 --> 02:41:43,524
Stay behind me.

1608
02:41:47,598 --> 02:41:49,599
Kiri!

1609
02:41:49,600 --> 02:41:52,234
Running out of time here, Corporal.

1610
02:41:53,103 --> 02:41:56,606
You already lost one kid today.
You really want to lose another?

1611
02:41:56,607 --> 02:41:59,224
Do not test me!

1612
02:42:00,152 --> 02:42:02,570
Just kill him, dad!

1613
02:42:02,571 --> 02:42:04,572
Kiri!

1614
02:42:04,573 --> 02:42:08,586
-Put down your weapons.
-Don't do that!

1615
02:42:10,119 --> 02:42:12,416
Kick them away.

1616
02:42:13,581 --> 02:42:15,820
Do it!

1617
02:42:17,376 --> 02:42:19,961
No...

1618
02:42:19,962 --> 02:42:23,130
-Cuff yourself.
-No. No. Don't hurt her okay? Don't

1619
02:42:23,131 --> 02:42:24,648
Stay there!

1620
02:42:24,649 --> 02:42:27,843
Don't come one step closer.

1621
02:42:27,844 --> 02:42:32,085
-Handcuffs on, now!
-You son of a bitch.

1622
02:42:32,115 --> 02:42:35,080
Please, don't hurt her.

1623
02:42:36,643 --> 02:42:40,855
Release, or I cut.

1624
02:42:42,649 --> 02:42:45,818
What, you think I care about some kid?

1625
02:42:45,819 --> 02:42:47,908
He is not mine.

1626
02:42:47,909 --> 02:42:50,780
We are not even the same species.

1627
02:42:50,781 --> 02:42:53,461
Please don't, don't hurt her.

1628
02:42:53,462 --> 02:42:55,326
Let her go.

1629
02:42:55,327 --> 02:42:59,461
Please, listen to me. Let her go.

1630
02:42:59,463 --> 02:43:01,895
Mom, don't kill him.

1631
02:43:01,896 --> 02:43:04,415
A son for a son.

1632
02:43:06,004 --> 02:43:08,235
Please, don't hurt her.

1633
02:43:09,632 --> 02:43:13,677
-I cut.
-Now just let her go, okay?

1634
02:43:15,679 --> 02:43:17,097
No!

1635
02:43:25,688 --> 02:43:28,221
Kiri, Kiri...

1636
02:43:34,696 --> 02:43:36,972
Spider!

1637
02:43:36,973 --> 02:43:39,413
Get them out of here.

1638
02:43:39,415 --> 02:43:41,867
Come with me.

1639
02:43:41,868 --> 02:43:44,248
I owe you a death.

1640
02:43:45,665 --> 02:43:49,709
Mom, come on. Mother!

1641
02:43:49,710 --> 02:43:52,137
You're not leaving, are you, Jake?

1642
02:43:52,199 --> 02:43:56,675
You know I never give up.

1643
02:43:56,676 --> 02:44:02,138
I will come and kill your whole family.

1644
02:44:02,139 --> 02:44:04,013
Dad!

1645
02:44:04,891 --> 02:44:07,251
Then let's get it done.

1646
02:44:16,944 --> 02:44:19,105
Jake!

1647
02:44:21,198 --> 02:44:25,202
-The fire is coming!
-Back to the ship!

1648
02:44:28,621 --> 02:44:30,873
Stay close to me.

1649
02:44:33,209 --> 02:44:35,710
Tuk! Tuk! Tuk!

1650
02:44:35,711 --> 02:44:38,810
Mother, take my hand! Hold on!

1651
02:44:40,549 --> 02:44:43,217
Mom!

1652
02:44:43,218 --> 02:44:46,171
Come on, Kiri; We have to get out of here.

1653
02:44:49,224 --> 02:44:51,225
Climb up!

1654
02:44:51,226 --> 02:44:55,228
Come on, Kiri. Go!

1655
02:44:55,229 --> 02:44:58,232
Swim! Climb up, Tuk!

1656
02:45:06,197 --> 02:45:08,240
Mom.

1657
02:45:08,241 --> 02:45:10,243
-Mom!
-Go, go, go!

1658
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:20,172
Keep climbing, go.

1659
02:45:23,255 --> 02:45:25,426
I got you!

1660
02:45:26,924 --> 02:45:29,063
Give me your hand!

1661
02:45:31,220 --> 02:45:33,187
Open it up!

1662
02:45:40,687 --> 02:45:43,355
-Open it up!
-Back, back!

1663
02:45:43,356 --> 02:45:44,744
Come on!

1664
02:45:46,067 --> 02:45:47,068
Tuk!

1665
02:45:56,786 --> 02:45:59,288
Up! Come on!

1666
02:46:01,248 --> 02:46:04,292
Climb! Get up!

1667
02:46:10,256 --> 02:46:12,372
We're rolling over!
Go, go, go! -Okay

1668
02:46:26,313 --> 02:46:29,154
Kiri; Keep going!

1669
02:46:32,276 --> 02:46:34,507
This way!

1670
02:46:39,283 --> 02:46:41,284
Open it up!

1671
02:46:43,286 --> 02:46:44,287
Mom!

1672
02:46:47,290 --> 02:46:48,869
Come on!

1673
02:46:57,341 --> 02:47:00,343
Further, Tuk.

1674
02:47:00,344 --> 02:47:02,346
We can't get out!

1675
02:47:04,305 --> 02:47:07,350
-We'll stay together, okay?
-Yes.

1676
02:47:36,377 --> 02:47:39,380
Oh Great Mother help us!

1677
02:48:22,419 --> 02:48:24,295
Kiri!

1678
02:48:43,438 --> 02:48:45,056
Bro.

1679
02:48:45,057 --> 02:48:48,400
Mom and dad are down there.

1680
02:48:48,401 --> 02:48:49,774
Grab on!

1681
02:48:49,775 --> 02:48:51,945
Bro; I'm ready.

1682
02:49:18,470 --> 02:49:19,763
Okay.

1683
02:49:47,455 --> 02:49:49,278
Jake!

1684
02:50:25,532 --> 02:50:27,312
Dad?

1685
02:50:31,370 --> 02:50:33,230
Fuck.

1686
02:50:46,551 --> 02:50:48,552
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1687
02:50:48,553 --> 02:50:51,555
-Breathe, Dad.
-Neteyam?

1688
02:50:51,556 --> 02:50:53,557
No, it's Lo'ak.

1689
02:50:53,558 --> 02:50:57,560
-Oh, Lo'ak...
-Sorry.

1690
02:50:57,561 --> 02:51:00,641
Neteyam's death is my fault.

1691
02:51:00,642 --> 02:51:03,870
Just focus on getting out.

1692
02:51:21,541 --> 02:51:25,289
The air pocket disappears. We
have to go out. Come on, Dad.

1693
02:51:32,089 --> 02:51:34,017
You know your way out.

1694
02:51:34,018 --> 02:51:37,555
Yes, but Dad it's gonna
be a long breath hold.

1695
02:51:37,556 --> 02:51:39,392
I can't make it.

1696
02:51:39,393 --> 02:51:42,601
But you can. Hurry out.

1697
02:51:42,602 --> 02:51:46,564
I can't lose you too, Dad. Please!

1698
02:51:49,609 --> 02:51:52,611
Mom, I'm scared.

1699
02:51:53,237 --> 02:51:54,925
It's all right.

1700
02:51:54,926 --> 02:51:57,597
Stick with me.

1701
02:51:57,598 --> 02:51:59,049
Stick to mom.

1702
02:52:00,869 --> 02:52:02,566
It's okay.

1703
02:52:17,635 --> 02:52:22,638
You just need to calm your
heart and be completely calm.

1704
02:52:22,962 --> 02:52:26,973
Breathe from down here.

1705
02:52:39,655 --> 02:52:44,658
The way of water has no beginning and no end.

1706
02:52:44,659 --> 02:52:48,662
The sea is around you and in you.

1707
02:52:48,663 --> 02:52:53,168
The sea is your home before
your birth and after your death.

1708
02:52:57,671 --> 02:53:01,674
The sea gives and the sea takes.

1709
02:53:01,841 --> 02:53:05,174
Water connects all things.

1710
02:53:05,970 --> 02:53:08,168
Life to death.

1711
02:53:09,473 --> 02:53:11,299
Darkness...

1712
02:53:11,300 --> 02:53:13,146
to light.

1713
02:53:34,705 --> 02:53:37,081
-Hi.
-Kiri!

1714
02:53:37,082 --> 02:53:40,069
It'll be fine, little sister.

1715
02:53:40,070 --> 02:53:43,608
Mom, I'm gonna give this to you.

1716
02:53:46,716 --> 02:53:48,717
It will help you.

1717
02:53:48,718 --> 02:53:51,720
Dad, you can do this.

1718
02:53:51,721 --> 02:53:54,433
Trust me.
-Yeah

1719
02:53:54,434 --> 02:53:56,724
Calm your heart.

1720
02:53:57,328 --> 02:53:59,330
Deep breaths.

1721
02:54:02,313 --> 02:54:04,507
Last breath.

1722
02:54:08,444 --> 02:54:10,245
Follow me.

1723
02:55:25,765 --> 02:55:27,799
Hang on.

1724
02:55:27,800 --> 02:55:29,921
Just breathe.

1725
02:55:33,814 --> 02:55:35,911
Thank you.

1726
02:55:44,032 --> 02:55:46,051
I see you;

1727
02:55:46,052 --> 02:55:47,358
My son.

1728

MaJake!

1729

Dad! Dad!

1730
02:55:54,834 --> 02:55:58,001
Come. Come here.

1731
02:55:58,002 --> 02:56:00,464

-I have you.

1732

Thank you.

1738

Let's move out.

1739
02:57:17,847 --> 02:57:19,932
My son;

1740
02:57:20,782 --> 02:57:23,564

Spider.

1744
02:58:16,088 --> 02:58:18,425
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

1745
02:58:21,384 --> 02:58:23,085
Come here.

1746
02:58:25,472 --> 02:58:27,849
A son, for a son.

Far away from here.

1757
03:00:45,225 --> 03:00:48,539
Your son lies with our ancestors.

Wow,

That's a big crab.

It was over there by the rocks,

1766

just like you said.

1767

What's the matter, dad? Why are you crying?
