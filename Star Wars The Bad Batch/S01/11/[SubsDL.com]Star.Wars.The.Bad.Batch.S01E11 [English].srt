1
00:00:44,106 --> 00:00:47,151
[crowd murmuring]

2
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:48,986
[male Twi'lek] They shouldn't be here.

3
00:00:54,909 --> 00:00:58,621
[Crosshair] I have a visual.
Gobi Glie and his fighters are here.

4
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:03,167
[female Twi'lek]
This is not right. What has Taa done?

5
00:01:09,924 --> 00:01:12,051
[Rampart] I'm disappointed, Senator Taa.

6
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:15,638
Despite our new refinery
bringing countless jobs to your citizens,

7
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:18,224
they seem troubled by our presence.

8
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:19,600
Not at all.

9
00:01:19,683 --> 00:01:24,230
I speak for the people when I say
this partnership is most welcome.

10
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:26,732
Wouldn't you agree, Syndulla?

11
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:30,111
I will always support
that which helps Ryloth.

12
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:32,738
And what about you, General?

13
00:01:32,822 --> 00:01:35,116
Do you share your wife's outlook?

14
00:01:37,576 --> 00:01:40,746
After years spent fighting,
peace is what is needed.

15
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:43,916
And with peace comes prosperity.

16
00:01:43,999 --> 00:01:45,918
This is a new era for Ryloth.

17
00:01:47,294 --> 00:01:48,295
Shall we?

18
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:55,219
Everything all right, General?

19
00:01:55,302 --> 00:01:58,556
[sighs]
I should be content the war's over.

20
00:01:58,639 --> 00:02:01,225
But change is not always easy.

21
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:04,228
I hope my people will embrace this peace.

22
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:06,188
Ryloth is safe, Cham.

23
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:08,274
This is what you fought for.

24
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:10,568
Yes, it is.

25
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:17,783
Thanks to the generosity
of the Galactic Empire,

26
00:02:17,867 --> 00:02:24,081
our new refinery will bring stability
and growth to Ryloth once again.

27
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:31,213
Now is the time for all Twi'leks
to step down from their military posts

28
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:34,341
and enjoy their hard-fought freedom.

29
00:02:34,425 --> 00:02:36,427
-[crowd murmuring]
-Step down?

30
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,930
With order established
throughout the Galaxy,

31
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:43,476
the Empire has offered
its valiant clone army

32
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:45,603
to protect and defend us.

33
00:02:45,686 --> 00:02:47,146
We want Syndulla!

34
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:49,023
[crowd shouting]

35
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:54,779
[male Twi'lek] Cham, tell us what to do!

36
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:56,864
[shouting continues]

37
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,459
My friends, I understand your uneasiness.

38
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:11,170
The one thing we have always done
as a people

39
00:03:11,253 --> 00:03:14,090
is stand together to defend Ryloth.

40
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:18,135
When the Clone War began
and the Republic was losing,

41
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,637
we were on our own.

42
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:23,849
But when our losses mounted
and the enemy closed in,

43
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:26,560
the clone army came to our aid.

44
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:30,272
We would not be here today
if it wasn't for them.

45
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:34,276
They fought with us. They fought for us.

46
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,696
And they have earned our respect.

47
00:03:36,779 --> 00:03:40,658
I trust them to protect us
as they always have.

48
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:44,078
The war has ended.

49
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:48,874
Let us lay down our weapons
and focus on Ryloth's future.

50
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:51,502
[cheering]

51
00:04:08,436 --> 00:04:11,188
What a shame your daughter's not here
to share in this.

52
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:14,650
Hera has other interests, Admiral.

53
00:04:32,209 --> 00:04:34,754
-Anything suspicious yet?
-[chatters]

54
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:36,088
Let me take a look.

55
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:42,344
[sighs] I dunno, Chop.

56
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:44,889
Nothing looks out of the ordinary.

57
00:04:44,972 --> 00:04:46,307
Just a mining facility.

58
00:04:47,391 --> 00:04:50,853
I overheard Father say
this is only the first location.

59
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:53,481
[chatters]

60
00:04:53,564 --> 00:04:55,107
No, we can't go.

61
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,735
Uncle Gobi told us to stay
and gather intel.

62
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:00,029
[chatters]

63
00:05:01,864 --> 00:05:03,115
[Chopper groans]

64
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:10,623
[squawks]

65
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:25,429
[squawking]

66
00:05:31,394 --> 00:05:32,561
Chopper?

67
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:34,688
Uh-oh.

68
00:05:41,904 --> 00:05:45,908
Clones should not be
the ones defending Ryloth.

69
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:48,160
How can Cham support this?

70
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:51,414
He knows the people are tired of fighting.

71
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:53,582
We can't go on as we have been.

72
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:57,294
By turning over our weapons,
he's made us defenseless.

73
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:59,255
I can't accept that.

74
00:05:59,338 --> 00:06:02,591
I've already reached out to my contact
to acquire more.

75
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:04,135
[Chopper chattering]

76
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:09,765
What happened now?

77
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:18,607
Sorry about this, General,

78
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:20,776
but they were found
inside a restricted zone.

79
00:06:22,653 --> 00:06:26,115
-[scoffs] We were just exploring.
-[chatters]

80
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,617
I'm in a tough spot, Cham.

81
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:32,413
Between us,
things are a little tense at the moment.

82
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:34,749
I won't report this,
but it can't happen again.

83
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:36,709
I assure you it won't.

84
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:38,085
Thank you, Howzer.

85
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:47,219
What were you doing out there?

86
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,721
I already told you.

87
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:51,015
I want the truth, Hera.

88
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:54,143
[Gobi] I sent her.

89
00:06:56,437 --> 00:06:59,565
Hera, Chopper, inside now.

90
00:07:03,444 --> 00:07:07,156
[sighs] It's not fair.
We didn't do anything wrong.

91
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:10,743
The Imperial refinery is off-limits, Hera.

92
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:12,036
You know that.

93
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:15,247
Uh, I never said we were at the refinery.

94
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,959
I have my ways too.

95
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,837
Now then, tell me what you saw.

96
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:23,214
Leave nothing out.

97
00:07:24,423 --> 00:07:26,634
That is unacceptable!

98
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:30,304
Do you realize what could have happened
if this was reported?

99
00:07:30,388 --> 00:07:32,932
My daughter spying
on an Imperial facility?

100
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:35,935
Why would it be spying?

101
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:38,145
What don't they want us to see?

102
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,689
This is a delicate situation.

103
00:07:40,773 --> 00:07:43,234
I will not have you put Hera
in the middle of it.

104
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:46,904
The clones were supposed to leave Ryloth
when the war ended.

105
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,908
I will not stand by
while more arrive each day.

106
00:07:51,617 --> 00:07:53,994
We agreed to disband when the time came.

107
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:57,373
What was the point of fighting
if we cannot accept peace?

108
00:07:57,915 --> 00:08:00,209
We've been friends a long time, Cham.

109
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:03,254
I'm telling you,
the Imperials are up to something.

110
00:08:04,505 --> 00:08:06,173
You just don't wanna see it.

111
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:13,681
Despite your warnings,

112
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:17,143
Cham Syndulla's proven to be
more cooperative than anticipated.

113
00:08:17,226 --> 00:08:20,229
Did you see how the crowd reacted to him?

114
00:08:20,312 --> 00:08:22,398
His influence over them is a problem.

115
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:25,067
Gobi Glie is your real threat.

116
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:27,403
Glie's his lieutenant.

117
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:30,364
Syndulla's fighters will always be
loyal to him.

118
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:32,408
They all must be dealt with.

119
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:35,119
We each have our parts to play, Senator.

120
00:08:35,202 --> 00:08:36,912
Be sure to see this through.

121
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:51,927
[chuckles] Do you still dream of flying?

122
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:55,681
All the time. Then I can go far from here.

123
00:08:56,932 --> 00:08:59,518
My dream was for a free Ryloth.

124
00:08:59,602 --> 00:09:02,563
For our people to happily live
in a world at peace.

125
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:04,148
We have that now.

126
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:06,442
The people don't seem very happy.

127
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:11,405
Their lives, much like yours, have been
surrounded by war for far too long.

128
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:12,782
But we are coming through it.

129
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:15,242
Uncle Gobi doesn't think so.

130
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:17,286
He says things are getting worse.

131
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,872
I am well aware of what your uncle thinks.

132
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:24,418
He and I want the same things
but differ in our approach.

133
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:27,588
If we need to fight,
I am as capable as anyone.

134
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:30,383
Gobi trusts me to do my part.

135
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,968
Why can't you?

136
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:36,806
[chuckles] That fiery spirit.

137
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:39,266
You remind me of myself at your age.

138
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,352
But I want more for you, Hera.

139
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:43,479
Fighting… it takes a toll.

140
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:47,692
My hope is that you won't ever
have to live a life like mine.

141
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:53,656
[sighs]

142
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:05,876
As you can see,
we are in the early stages.

143
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,423
But the doonium mine here will rebuild
parts of the galaxy affected by the war.

144
00:10:13,968 --> 00:10:18,681
We were told this refinery
would not be a military facility.

145
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:22,351
But your soldiers and armament
suggest otherwise.

146
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:25,062
Under the Republic's rule,
your planet was vulnerable,

147
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:26,981
but that is no longer the case.

148
00:10:27,064 --> 00:10:30,693
The Empire is dedicated to protecting
the interests of Ryloth.

149
00:10:33,112 --> 00:10:35,614
Please excuse me.
There's a matter I must address.

150
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:37,324
You can see yourselves out.

151
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:44,165
Admiral Rampart cares more about his own
interests than those of our people.

152
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,168
I hear Gobi's voice in your thoughts.

153
00:10:47,251 --> 00:10:49,628
Don't lose sight of
what we're trying to achieve.

154
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:52,548
I am questioning the cost to achieve it.

155
00:10:52,631 --> 00:10:56,719
How can we trust these Imperials
when they are keeping things from us?

156
00:10:56,802 --> 00:11:00,598
We need to try for the sake of Ryloth.

157
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:06,312
And if the Empire's version of peace
is not one we can accept, then what?

158
00:11:13,944 --> 00:11:15,738
You're late. Let's get moving.

159
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:18,908
I can't go. I'm sorry.

160
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:21,619
Your father said no more spying.

161
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:23,537
This is a simple supply run.

162
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:26,290
Still, I think I should stay here.

163
00:11:26,832 --> 00:11:29,668
All right.
But I was going to let you fly this time.

164
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:31,545
Fly? Really?

165
00:11:32,505 --> 00:11:34,215
I guess it will have to wait.

166
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:35,549
Chop, cover for me!

167
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:36,634
Wait!

168
00:11:36,717 --> 00:11:39,804
[chatters]

169
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:50,064
[rapid beeping]

170
00:11:52,108 --> 00:11:55,861
Glie's ship's been tagged,
and he's not alone.

171
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:03,411
Making our approach at one-six-two.

172
00:12:04,412 --> 00:12:05,413
How was that?

173
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:07,623
Yes, yes. Very good.

174
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:11,252
Now ease off on the thrust.
It's time to land.

175
00:12:11,335 --> 00:12:12,336
I can do it.

176
00:12:12,878 --> 00:12:15,047
No takeoffs or landings. Not yet.

177
00:12:18,884 --> 00:12:19,885
Watch and learn.

178
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,471
The contact's inbound.

179
00:12:39,488 --> 00:12:41,574
What supplies are we here to get?

180
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:42,783
Weapons.

181
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:46,245
But we just turned over all our weapons
to the Empire.

182
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:47,329
Not for long.

183
00:12:53,753 --> 00:12:57,214
I've never seen a ship like that before.

184
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,867
[Hunter] Are you Gobi? Cid sent us.

185
00:13:25,576 --> 00:13:28,704
[Tech] Along with three dozen blasters
and a case of thermal detonators.

186
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:30,456
Let's see them.

187
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:48,349
What type of ship is this?

188
00:13:48,432 --> 00:13:50,976
A modified Omicron-class attack shuttle.

189
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,728
Can I have a look inside?

190
00:13:53,437 --> 00:13:55,689
Hunter, can she come aboard?

191
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:00,319
Okay. You can come up.

192
00:14:00,403 --> 00:14:01,696
But no funny business.

193
00:14:02,446 --> 00:14:03,739
Funny business?

194
00:14:04,407 --> 00:14:06,617
Uh-huh. I'll be watching you.

195
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:08,786
Uh… [chuckles]

196
00:14:08,869 --> 00:14:11,497
Okay, then. Show me around.

197
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:14,875
This is the sensor array,
and that's the deflector shield.

198
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,586
Over there is the nav readout,
and this is the hyperdrive.

199
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,550
You sure know a lot about this.
Do you fly?

200
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:23,634
No.

201
00:14:23,718 --> 00:14:27,847
Tech won't let me train until I can recite
all the ship's specifications from memory.

202
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:32,518
Specs are only half of it.
Flying is-- It's about a feeling.

203
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:33,811
What do you mean?

204
00:14:34,478 --> 00:14:39,275
When I close my eyes
and picture myself up there, I feel it.

205
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:43,320
The instruments help guide you,
but you plot your course.

206
00:14:43,404 --> 00:14:44,947
You're free.

207
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:46,866
So you're a pilot?

208
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:49,201
No. Not yet.

209
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:52,538
But one day.

210
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,081
Come on.

211
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:56,667
I'll show you my favorite part
of the ship.

212
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:02,548
Up there… that's where I sleep.

213
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:05,468
You get to live on a starship?

214
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:07,219
That's my dream.

215
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:09,764
Well, technically,
it's our gunner's mount.

216
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:14,894
But when we're not getting chased
or shot at, it's my room.

217
00:15:14,977 --> 00:15:16,812
Who's chasing you?

218
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:18,814
Are you in some kind of trouble?

219
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:21,609
I thought you were in trouble.

220
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:23,444
Isn't that why we're here?

221
00:15:26,364 --> 00:15:27,823
[Gobi] It's a start.

222
00:15:27,907 --> 00:15:31,077
Have Cid contact me
when she has more to sell.

223
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,496
Building an arsenal attracts attention.

224
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:35,581
You better know what you're getting into.

225
00:15:35,664 --> 00:15:37,208
We don't have a choice.

226
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:40,211
Hera, we're leaving.

227
00:15:41,545 --> 00:15:42,838
Thanks for the tour.

228
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:44,632
Anytime.

229
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:50,388
Good luck.

230
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:54,558
[Hunter] Make a new friend?

231
00:15:54,642 --> 00:15:57,561
She's kind of strange. I like her.

232
00:15:58,062 --> 00:16:00,314
Did you know flying's about a feeling?

233
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:04,902
[Tech] What feeling?

234
00:16:32,012 --> 00:16:36,892
If takeoffs and landings are the hardest,
isn't that more reason to teach me?

235
00:16:37,393 --> 00:16:38,602
You are persistent.

236
00:16:39,353 --> 00:16:41,772
We've got an Imperial ship approaching.

237
00:16:41,856 --> 00:16:43,566
Go low. Try to lose them.

238
00:16:54,994 --> 00:16:56,579
[alarm beeping]

239
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:05,212
Move in.

240
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,802
[beeping continues]

241
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:23,105
What do we do?

242
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:50,633
These three were caught smuggling weapons
onto the planet.

243
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:54,136
Miss Syndulla,

244
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:58,307
I find your involvement in such matters
to be most distressing.

245
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:01,435
Cham's behind this! She's the proof.

246
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,354
He's plotting an uprising.

247
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:04,855
That's not true!

248
00:18:04,939 --> 00:18:07,858
You being here is enough to implicate him.

249
00:18:08,526 --> 00:18:10,820
The public won't see it that way.

250
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:13,864
You said it yourself.
He has influence over them.

251
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:17,910
And the fact remains,
Cham has not committed a crime… yet.

252
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:20,079
But this Syndulla has.

253
00:18:20,705 --> 00:18:22,415
Sir, she's only a child.

254
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:25,668
She is an insurgent. Take them away.

255
00:18:39,223 --> 00:18:43,060
I'm clocking three of Glie's fighters
on the western ridge.

256
00:18:43,144 --> 00:18:45,104
Should I take care of them?

257
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:47,982
No. Let them report back.

258
00:18:48,065 --> 00:18:50,151
Just make sure you get into position.

259
00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:01,704
We have to contact the general.

260
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:05,624
Smuggling weapons? What was Hera thinking?

261
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,127
We must speak to Senator Taa immediately.

262
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,838
[chattering]

263
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:11,922
What did you find out?

264
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:13,174
[chatters]

265
00:19:13,257 --> 00:19:15,509
Guilty of treason?

266
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:17,303
They haven't had a trial yet.

267
00:19:18,596 --> 00:19:21,265
-Taa will see that they never get one.
-[chatters]

268
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:24,477
We must intercept that convoy
before it reaches the capital.

269
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,561
Where are they now?

270
00:19:25,644 --> 00:19:28,147
Western outskirts. Sector 3.

271
00:19:28,689 --> 00:19:29,774
Chopper, let's go!

272
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:55,633
The tank's heading for the narrows.

273
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:58,052
We have to seize control of it
before then.

274
00:19:58,135 --> 00:19:59,136
Split up.

275
00:20:00,262 --> 00:20:02,765
-Stay here and wait for my signal.
-[chatters]

276
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:47,643
-[trooper] We've got hostiles inbound!
-The convoy's being targeted.

277
00:20:47,727 --> 00:20:49,812
It's Syndulla. I know it.

278
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:52,523
What are you waiting for? Attack!

279
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:55,317
Yes, sir.

280
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:08,330
[trooper grunts]

[blaster fires]

282
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:42,823
-[trooper] We're losing the signal!
-Where are the reinforcements?

283
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:47,870
[garbled comms transmission]

284
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:49,413
Our comms have been cut.

285
00:21:50,873 --> 00:21:52,166
What do we do now?

286
00:22:14,522 --> 00:22:16,607
[electronics beeping]

287
00:22:20,903 --> 00:22:22,863
[alarm blaring]

288
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:25,324
You must hold them off
until reinforcements get here.

289
00:22:26,117 --> 00:22:27,827
No. It's too late for that.

290
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:30,579
Tell them we surrender.

291
00:22:30,663 --> 00:22:33,332
Surrender? What are you doing?

292
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:34,792
Keeping us alive, Senator.

293
00:22:36,961 --> 00:22:37,962
Mom!

294
00:22:47,513 --> 00:22:49,348
What is Father going to do?

295
00:22:49,432 --> 00:22:51,350
Taa will not let this go.

296
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:53,269
Let us worry about that.

297
00:23:02,486 --> 00:23:04,989
How dare you attack our convoy!

298
00:23:05,072 --> 00:23:06,532
You are all traitors.

299
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:09,744
You threaten my daughter
and accuse her of treason?

300
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:14,957
For years, I've watched you put your greed
and self-interests above Ryloth.

301
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,502
You are the one guilty of treason.

302
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:19,587
Do something!

303
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:22,089
He's the one holding the blaster.

304
00:23:22,173 --> 00:23:25,426
Cham, stop and think
about what you're doing.

305
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:34,393
Taa's time will come, but not this way.

306
00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:44,153
Thank you for playing your part, Senator.

307
00:23:47,114 --> 00:23:48,741
-[blaster fires]
-[grunts]

308
00:23:59,168 --> 00:24:01,504
Chopper, get Hera out of here. Go!

309
00:24:10,304 --> 00:24:11,430
Arrest these insurgents

310
00:24:11,514 --> 00:24:13,808
for the attempted assassination
of Orn Free Taa.

311
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:30,366
The Syndulla girl won't get far.

312
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:32,201
Have our forces find her.
