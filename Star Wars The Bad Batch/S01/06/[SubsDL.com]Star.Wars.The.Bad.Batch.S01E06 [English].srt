1
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:55,256
[screams, gasps]

2
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,431
Sorry.

3
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,524
Steady.

4
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,192
Arms level... and keep
your eye on the target.

5
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,192
You can do it, kid!

6
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,944
Not a chance. Miss!
Come on! Miss!

7
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,235
Ah! Got it.

8
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,532
- [laughs] Bull's-eye! Pay up.
- [groans]

9
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,236
Good. Again.

10
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:19,076
But I've already hit
the target three times.

11
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:23,582
Out of 12. That's
luck, Omega, not skill.

12
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,787
Soldiers need to be consistent.

13
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,087
[sighs]

14
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,300
[Weequay] Okay, double
or nothing she chokes.

15
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,216
- [groans]
- [cackles]

16
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,933
I was doing better until
those two showed up.

17
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:43,652
You have to learn to tune out
distractions, which comes with practice.

18
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,364
Again.

19
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,112
[grunts]

20
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,030
[sighs]

21
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,492
Not exactly a natural, is she?

22
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,870
- Hey!
- Okay, playtime's over. We need to talk.

23
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,752
You two, scram.

24
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,539
- Hey! Okay, we're going.
- We're going!

25
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:08,341
I assume you boys know
what a tactical droid is?

26
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:09,962
They were the opera...

27
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,336
The operational brains of
the Separatist military...

28
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,634
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. This is
my briefing, Goggles.

29
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:15,718
Hey!

30
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,812
Tactical droid intel
has tremendous value,

31
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:23,808
which is why you're gonna break into
this decommissioning facility on Corellia

32
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,903
and retrieve one before
they're all destroyed.

33
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,069
We haven't decided if we're
gonna work for you or not.

34
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,741
Allow me to decide
for you. You're in!

35
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:40,044
I'm talking a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

36
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,958
You make money, I make
money, and I watch your back.

37
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,634
With the heat on you, it's
the best option you've got.

38
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,796
[sighs] I guess we're in.

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,550
I know you're in. I
just told you you're in.

40
00:02:55,633 --> 00:03:00,513
And you, you're releasing too soon
because of those weak noodle arms.

41
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,217
Build up your strength.

42
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,230
Lesson over.

43
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,647
[target sizzles]

44
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,542
This old trick?

45
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,459
It gets us past the
planetary sensors every time.

46
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,538
Why is a tactical droid more
important than the other droids?

47
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:34,376
The more tactical droids fought,
the more they learned... and won.

48
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,514
Yeah, except against
us. [Chuckling] Yeah!

49
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,841
With clones now
serving the Empire,

50
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,097
knowing how to defeat them
just went up in value.

51
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,520
We're approaching the
decommissioning site.

52
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,599
We can land at the industrial
dockyard and go in on foot.

53
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:23,894
[droid chatter]

54
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,849
[Hunter] Cid didn't mention this
place was guarded by police droids.

55
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,818
[Tech] They're operating on
a rotating quadrant scan.

56
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,319
If timed correctly, there's an
entry point in their blind spot.

57
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,403
Follow me.

58
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,116
[Wrecker] Uh-oh.

59
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,459
[groans]

60
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,891
[sighs]

61
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,647
[bubbling, sizzling]

62
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,792
- [worker grunts]
- [Wrecker] Nighty night.

63
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:41,841
[Hunter] Echo, Tech. We'll
locate and retrieve the droid.

64
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,545
Wrecker, cover us up top.

65
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,845
[Wrecker] But being the
lookout was Crosshair's job.

66
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,560
[Hunter] That wasn't a request.

67
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,390
What about me? What should I do?

68
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,345
[Hunter] Stay here and keep
your eyes peeled for the target.

69
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,436
Let's move.

70
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:56,943
[Wrecker groans]

71
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,795
[worker gasps]

72
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:33,393
[Echo] A tactical droid is listed
in the system, but only one.

73
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,476
The rest have already
been destroyed.

74
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,152
[Hunter] We have one shot
at this. Let's get it right.

75
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,071
[Tech] Where was the
droid off-loaded?

76
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,480
[Echo] North end conveyor.

77
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,492
[Omega gasps] Found it.

78
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,571
Sort of.

79
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,905
The droid's already in pieces.

80
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,661
[Tech] Is the head intact?

81
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,123
[Omega] Affirmative.

82
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,372
Wait! Someone just ran
off with the droid head.

83
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,382
[Wrecker] I see 'em. One of the
workers is stealing our target.

84
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,214
I'm on it.

85
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,127
[Hunter] Negative.
Stay out of sight.

86
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,375
[worker] I don't think so.

87
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,802
Stay back.

88
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,596
Whoa, whoa. Take it easy, kid.

89
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,431
I don't wanna hurt you, but I
can't have you getting in the way.

90
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,477
You're the one in my way.

91
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,902
[Trace] Rafa, I've got
the target. Where are you?

92
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,941
Don't answer that.

93
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,068
[Trace] Rafa, come in. What's going on?
Where are you? We need to get out of here.

94
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,662
[Tech] Who are you?

95
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,543
Who am I? Who are you?

96
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,791
Your arms look a
little shaky there.

97
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,455
Okay, you win.

98
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,644
Why don't you ease up on that
thing and we can talk about this?

99
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,470
[Omega grunts]

100
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,396
Uh-oh.

101
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,112
[worker] We've got blaster fire!

102
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,605
All eyes on the floor!

103
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,413
[gasps]

104
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,655
[worker] Security
breach! Lock it down!

105
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,253
[male electronic
voice] Danger. Danger.

106
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,540
[alarm blaring]

107
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,254
Great. How do you plan on
getting out of here now?

108
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,711
[scoffs] Nice going, kid.

109
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,337
Me? You're the one
who grabbed my bow!

110
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,474
[droid chatter]

111
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,474
Don't just stand
there. Grab a weapon.

112
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,727
I had one.

113
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,314
[droid chatter]

114
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:43,897
[Wrecker] Get moving!

115
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,322
See ya.

116
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,860
Hey!

117
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,823
[Echo] We've got police
droids closing in.

118
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,073
[Hunter] Focus your fire.

119
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,827
[droid chatter]

120
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,029
- [comm beeps]
- Omega, report.

121
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,002
There's a second person
after the tactical droid.

122
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,923
Don't worry. I'm in pursuit.

123
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,422
[Hunter] No, stay put. We
already have the droid head.

124
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:07,924
No, you don't.

125
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,638
Rafa, I have the package.
Meet me at the rendezvous.

126
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,643
[Hunter] I'll get the head.
You get this lockdown lifted.

127
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,417
- [comm beeps]
- Trace, where are you?

128
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,731
[Trace] Down here!

129
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,397
Catch!

130
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,701
[grunts] Got it! Come on.

131
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,078
[both] I've got it!

132
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,544
[droid chatter]

133
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,998
Hope you're not
expecting gratitude.

134
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,507
[Hunter] Should I have
let the droids shoot you?

135
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,103
[Omega shouts, grunts]

136
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,185
- Thanks!
- [Rafa shouts]

137
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,400
I have the droid head!

138
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,729
[Echo] Nice work.
Now hang tight.

139
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,276
[electronics power down]

140
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,912
[Tech] You shorted
out the entire system.

141
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,662
[Echo] I had to
override the lockdown.

142
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,164
Wrecker, get to the
main control panel.

143
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,207
[Wrecker] Whoa, whoa! Whoa...

144
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,625
I can't reach the platform.

145
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:32,262
[Echo] It's the only way to reboot
the whole facility. Figure it out!

146
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,180
[Wrecker] Yeah, that's
easy for you to say!

147
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:37,885
[sighs]

148
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,176
[Echo] Wrecker, hurry.

149
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,848
[Wrecker groaning]

150
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,976
[grunting]

151
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,782
Don't look down. Don't
look down. Don't look down.

152
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,569
[grunting]

153
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,696
- [Tech] Wrecker, what are you waiting for?
- [groaning, grunts]

154
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:00,954
[alarm blares]

155
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,698
[shouts, grunts]

156
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,916
I'll take that.

157
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,455
[grunting]

158
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,298
[Tech] Wrecker, the system's
online. Now get down here.

159
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,385
[groans]

160
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:21,140
My... [grunts] ...head.

161
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,595
[whispering] Good soldiers...

162
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,853
[inhales sharply, groans]

163
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,607
[grunts]

164
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:35,111
Good... soldiers... [groans]

165
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:36,945
[droid chatter]

166
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,924
[Hunter] Why are you
after that tactical droid?

167
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:52,051
That's not your business, clone.

168
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,458
[Hunter] It is today.

169
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,102
- [comm beeps]
- Rafa, I've got the target.

170
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,639
Meet me at the north exit.

171
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,562
Little busy right now.

172
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:07,476
[grunts]

173
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:12,020
[Omega grunts, panting]

174
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,485
[grunting]

175
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,666
Hunter, I'm stuck on the
conveyor. I need help.

176
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:30,923
[Hunter] I'm on my way.

177
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,510
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking down the support posts.

178
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:39,721
Follow me!

179
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,389
Who put you in charge?

180
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:50,853
[metal creaks]

181
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,693
[Rafa screams]

182
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,949
[grunting]

183
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,035
Hunter!

184
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,409
Hang on, Omega!

185
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,212
Hey, you maniac, you
almost got me killed!

186
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:17,594
[grunts]

187
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,718
[screams]

188
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,302
[grunts]

189
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,267
Hey, over here! Hurry!

190
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,609
[grunting]

191
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,520
I can't reach!

192
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,323
Grab something!

193
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,367
[whimpers]

194
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,253
[grunts]

195
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,881
[Hunter grunts]

196
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,052
[Hunter] We got you, kid.

197
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,050
Are you okay?

198
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,514
Yeah. [Panting]

199
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:07,471
[Hunter] Thank you.

200
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,215
You're welcome.

201
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,061
- [metal clanks]
- [Rafa screams, grunts]

202
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,943
Oh, I'm fine. Don't worry
about me or anything.

203
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,026
[droid chatters, groans]

204
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,529
Well, this has
been a real treat,

205
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:28,164
but as you can see, the
tactical droid is ours.

206
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,470
[Hunter] We can
debate this later.

207
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,834
If we wanna get out of here,
we need to work together.

208
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,583
Fine, but I still
don't like you.

209
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,745
[Hunter] I'm used to it.

210
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,423
[Tech] Wrecker,
come in. Wrecker?

211
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,634
[grunts]

212
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:44,724
- No. No. No, no, no.
- [Tech] Wrecker?

213
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,801
[Crosshair] Good
soldiers follow orders.

214
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,756
[grunts, pants]

215
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,412
[Hunter] All the exits are blocked.
And it's about to get worse.

216
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:57,687
A larger wave of police
droids is headed our way.

217
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,108
We need a diversion.

218
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,283
What we need is a diversion.

219
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,700
Is there an echo in here?

220
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,696
- [Echo] Yes.
- What?

221
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:12,826
I'm Echo.

222
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,912
Really?

223
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:17,331
Okay, Echo, we
need a distraction.

224
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,167
And he can help with that.

225
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,047
What's that thing gonna do?

226
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:28,012
We need an army to get out of
this. And we happen to have one.

227
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,141
[whirring]

228
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,899
[Echo] If you activate those clankers,
they'll start shooting at us.

229
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,978
Not if we're controlling the
droid who's controlling them.

230
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,818
[Tech] Excellent idea.

231
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,189
That should do the trick.

232
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,527
[beeps] Cannot
transmit... [powers down]

233
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,113
It didn't work.

234
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,328
[Tech] It will, once
we boost the signal.

235
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,204
And this will help me
access the program.

236
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,003
[device powers up]

237
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,745
[beeping]

238
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,668
- [comm beeps]
- Wrecker, do you copy?

239
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,177
[grunting]

240
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,509
[Omega] Wrecker, where are
you? We need your help.

241
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,846
[grumbles]

242
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,395
[Wrecker] On my way.

243
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,685
Brilliant plan, Trace.
Really. One of your best.

244
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,824
We just need a little more time.

245
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,276
[Wrecker screams]

246
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,911
[Wrecker laughing] Yeah!

247
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,503
I got tired of you guys
having all the fun.

248
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,288
Now, him I like.

249
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,762
[Tech] Hang on. The data
exchange is nearly complete.

250
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:51,854
[beeping]

251
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,008
Done!

252
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,556
[tactical droid]
What is happening?

253
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,639
Activate battle droids. Command
them to attack all police droids.

254
00:16:58,727 --> 00:16:59,977
Affirmative.

255
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:07,816
[battle droid 1] Huh?
What's happening?

256
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,161
[battle droid 2] I
don't know. Did we win?

257
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:14,658
New command sequence. Your target
is factory security personnel.

258
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,581
[battle droid 1 screams]

259
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,018
[battle droid 2]
Orders are orders.

260
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,882
[screams, grunts]

261
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,011
[Echo] Never thought I'd see
battle droids helping us.

262
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,285
[Hunter] That's
our cue. Move out!

263
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,314
[Tech] Mission accomplished.

264
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,468
[Hunter] Nice work.

265
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,386
- [comm beeps]
- R7, we're ready for a pickup.

266
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:39,845
[R7 whistles, beeps]

267
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,555
We're almost there.

268
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:45,897
Trust me. You'll see us.

269
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,152
No!

270
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,697
Yeah!

271
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,534
Nice shot.

272
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:57,657
It's all about tuning
out distractions.

273
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,542
He's here. Let's go!

274
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,683
[R7 beeps]

275
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,640
All that work for nothing.

276
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,687
Whoever Cid's buyer is
isn't gonna be happy.

277
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,732
Let me get this straight.

278
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:31,106
You knew how dangerous the
information on the tactical droid is,

279
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,534
but you didn't know who
you were giving it to?

280
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,870
We're being paid to acquire
and deliver, not ask questions.

281
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,501
Our contact needed that information
to fight back against the Empire.

282
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:45,424
They're trying to help people
and make things better.

283
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:51,843
Why aren't you fighting for the Empire?
Isn't that what you clones do now?

284
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,760
Not all of us. We're different.

285
00:18:55,844 --> 00:18:58,854
Yeah, I've heard that before.

286
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,981
You should come
visit us sometime.

287
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:12,113
Isn't that part of Ord
Mantell a little... seedy?

288
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,453
Very. It's great!

289
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,570
Keep working on that bow, kid.

290
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,657
I will. Bye!

291
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:21,657
Bye, Omega.

292
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,369
[footsteps departing]

293
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,496
Here.

294
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,922
What's this?

295
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,090
Tech copied the tactical droid's intel
to this data rod before it got destroyed.

296
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,009
Why are you giving it to us?

297
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,337
You'll use it for
the right reasons.

298
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,596
Huh. Maybe you are different.

299
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:44,852
To be honest, things were clearer
when we were just soldiers.

300
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,444
Take it from me.

301
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,105
In the end, we all choose sides.

302
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,970
Patch him through, R7.

303
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,885
[R7 whistles, beeps]

304
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,440
We acquired the tactical
droid data from Corellia.

305
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,812
And we had help.

306
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:35,694
It was a squad of rogue clones,
and I know where to find them.

307
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,409
Thought you might wanna know.
