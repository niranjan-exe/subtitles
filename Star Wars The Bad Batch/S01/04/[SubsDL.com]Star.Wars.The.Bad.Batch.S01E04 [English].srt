1
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,380
Idaflor, that's where we'll go.

2
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,592
But Idaflor's not
even inhabited.

3
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,262
Which makes it the
perfect place to hide out.

4
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:55,262
"Hide"? But I've been stuck
on Kamino my whole life.

5
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,387
Can't we explore?

6
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,894
Not right now. We have to wait
for things to settle down.

7
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,977
Well, we won't be doing either.

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:07,233
We don't have enough fuel, and we
are also entirely out of rations.

9
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,607
Without the Republic
to provide us supplies,

10
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,414
we'll have to acquire these
necessities on our own.

11
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,159
[Echo] Well, we got
a bigger problem.

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,370
Comm chatter has our ship's
signature on a wanted list.

13
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,832
So we scramble it.

14
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,252
You can do that?

15
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,750
Of course I can do it.

16
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:25,171
But I need to land in order to
perform those modifications.

17
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:29,211
By my calculations, the
closest planet is... Pantora.

18
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,336
Well, Pantora it is.

19
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,425
- [computer beeping]
- [footsteps departing]

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,940
[exhales] Pantora it is.

21
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:16,507
- [door opens]
- [device beeping]

22
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:21,772
Why'd you tell me we're out
of rations? Now I'm starving.

23
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,600
Our priority is scrambling
the ship's signature key.

24
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,016
[grunts] Your priority.

25
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,165
[man clears throat, coughs]

26
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,279
Are you fellas here for repairs?

27
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,608
- Just a minor calibration and fuel.
- [clears throat]

28
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:36,744
Have at it. Just need
to scan your ship in.

29
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,909
Are you sure about that?

30
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,620
I suppose I could
skip that step.

31
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,956
Mm-hmm.

32
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,339
- Ah, that was easy.
- [clears throat]

33
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,209
Aren't you, uh,
forgetting something?

34
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,297
Huh?

35
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,840
You... You said
you'd skip the step.

36
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,046
- I could.
- Great!

37
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,017
If I had some incentive

38
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,637
of the financial variety.

39
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,688
I think he means credits.

40
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,228
Is that sufficient incentive?

41
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,160
[chuckles]

42
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,581
Pleasure doing
business with you.

[chuckles]

44
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,754
We're getting the hang
of this civilian thing.

45
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,969
- [comm beeps]
- This is Raspar Six at Ro station.

46
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,545
Word on the channels is,

47
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:45,227
you're looking for a certain modified
Omicron-class attack shuttle.

48
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:50,478
I might know where to find it, but
that information's going to cost you.

49
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,613
[woman] I'll make it
well worth your while.

50
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,781
Transmit the coordinates and
make sure they don't leave.

51

[droid honking]

53

[grunts] You can't sell that
explosive. It's our last one.

54
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,846
And it's the only thing
we have worth any money.

55
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,138
You wanna eat, don't you?

56
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,393
Why do Tech and I have
to do all the repairs

57
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,805
while you get to go sightseeing?

58
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,904
"Sightseeing"?

59
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:36,649
No, no. This is a supply run.
In and out, quickly and quietly.

60
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,025
Yeah. And you
stick out too much.

61
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,492
Oh, and you don't?

62
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,492
Not dressed like this.

63
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,485
All right. Let's get moving.

64
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:48,037
- Omega, you're with us.
- Yes.

65

Hey! Bring back
something good to eat.

00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,543
The end of the war.

Let's get what we came
for and get out of here.

80

But the war is over.
Isn't that good?

81

side you're on.

The signature key should be embedded
below the rear parallax inverters.

[grumbles] Just tell
me what to rip out.

Look, this is a pyro denton
worth at least 1,800 credits.

90
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,873
Maybe in the black market, but I'm
running a reputable business here.

Hey, kid! You break
it, you buy it.

92
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,051
[Omega] Sorry.

93

If you're looking to sell
something, how about your droid?

[Echo] Droid?

Uh, he's a... he's a
military prototype.

96

Military, eh?

97
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,030
Hmm.

98
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,494
I'll give you 2,000.

Hmm.

Give me a minute.

[Echo] No, no, no.
You can't be serious.

102
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,293
We need the credits.

103
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:42,045
Once we get the supplies, I'll give
you the signal and you can leave.

[Echo] Fine, but
not at that price.

Make it 4,000.

all. You hungry, kid?

Not exactly.

Then why do you have a blaster?

To protect myself.

The galaxy's a dangerous

Yeah. It's a good thing

I've had in a long time.

Come on. This way.

165
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:47,623
[Hunter] Omega.

166
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,247
Oh, there's one
of my friends now.

167
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,925
Omega, step away from her.

168
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:00,138
Why? She was helping
me look for you.

169
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,770
Yes, Omega and I were
getting to know each other.

170
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,529

179
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,602
Wrecker, easy with my ship.

180
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,694
Your ship?

181
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,888
[ship beeping]

182
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,942
There. That is
the signature key.

183
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,651
[Wrecker] Ah.

184
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,611
Got it.

185
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,066
With a slight adjustment,

186
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,076
we'll be able to scramble our
signature whenever we need to.

187
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,709
[Hunter] Wrecker, Tech, Echo. I
lost Omega. Somebody attacked us.

188
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,830
[Wrecker] Somebody who?

189
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,836
[sighs] A woman. Highly
trained. She's after the kid.

190
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,760
Yeah, we'll see about that.

[comm beeps]

192
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,546
I'll tap into the
central security network.

193
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,054
There should be enough cameras
in this city to find her.

194
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:27,887
[Hunter] Listen, I made a bit of noise
out here. Get the ship ready to go.

195
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:30,644
Well, it's not technically
a ship at the moment.

196
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:34,397
And unless you have a team of maintenance
droids, it's going to be a while.

197
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,611
I can help with that.

198
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,860
Gear up, fellas, we're
going into the field.

I am afraid that is impossible. We

Look, the sooner we do this, the
sooner you're back in charge.

00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,916
Even so, I'm not capable of
removing our restraining bolts.

That's why I'm the supervisor.

She went down into the maintenance
