[clone troopers

Not to be a pessimist,

17
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,281
but if the commander isn't back
soon with those reinforcements...

18
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,486
My Padawan will be here.

19
00:01:58,576 --> 00:01:59,576
[Caleb] Master!

20
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,924
Here. I'm here.

21
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:07,837
Caleb, where are
the reinforcements?

22
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,169
Don't worry. They're
right behind me.

23
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,550
Uh, where are they?

24
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:15,804
Caleb.

25
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:16,925
Trust me.

26
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:19,352
- Well, how many are there?
- Five of them.

27
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,981
Five? We're done.

28
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,308
Yeah, that's what I thought,
but you gotta see these clones.

No. No.

Hold your positions.

Make a hole!

37
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,005
[battle droid] Hey!

38
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,525
I don't believe it.
That's Clone Force 99.

[Wrecker laughing]

Crosshair, let's get

Sir, yes, sir.

Huh? Hey. Stop that.

Adjust the stabilizers.
We're going over.

45
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,318
Hey, clanker. Catch.

46
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,282
Huh? [Groans]

47
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,128
I guess I'm in charge now.

48
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:22,014
Hey. What's that?

49
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:24,888
Oh, no...

50
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,037
[battle droid] Drop your
weapons and surrender.

51

[groans]

52
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:58,343
If you're done hiding down there, I
suggest you launch a counterattack.

53
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,473
Another droid
battalion's approaching.

54
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,090
The general is the one who
gives the orders around here.

55
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,598
He's right, Captain.
This is our chance.

56
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,640
Launch the counterattack.

57
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,811
Yes, General.

58
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,853
All right, men. Let's go!

59
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,356
[clone trooper] Sir, yes,
sir. Move it! Move it!

60
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,649
[clone trooper shouting]

61
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,824
There you are, little Jedi.
You missed all the fun.

62
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,619
Watching your team in
action was the fun.

63
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:26,028
Care to introduce your
new friends, Caleb?

64
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,157
Yes, Master.

65
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:32,923
This is Wrecker, Hunter,
Echo, Tech and Crosshair.

66
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,839
While I'm not sure "fun" is
the sentiment I would express,

67
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,710
I agree with my Padawan.

68
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,467
Your exploits were
quite impressive.

69
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,260
Exploits?

70
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,597
Don't overthink it, Wrecker.

71
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,064
Thank you, General.

72
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:51,768
Now, would one of you please explain
where my actual reinforcements are?

73
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,561
Rerouted to the capital.
We're all you're getting.

74
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,897
Ha! We're all you need.

75
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:02,202
Actually, if my intel is correct,
the general will not need any of us.

76
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,606
The Clone War may soon be over.

77
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,408
Better tell that to the
clankers headed our way.

78
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,502
I am referring to the
encrypted comm chatter.

79
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,958
Clone intelligence is reporting
Jedi General Obi-Wan Kenobi

80
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,540
has found and engaged
General Grievous on Utapau.

81
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,764
If he captures or
kills Grievous,

82
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,469
the Separatist command
structure will collapse.

83
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,140
And most likely the droid
armies along with them.

84
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:30,809
A fascinating theory, yet unfortunately
not something we can control from here.

85
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,520
I suggest we focus
on the task at hand.

86
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,984
Any orders?

87
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,022
Or shall we do what we do?

88
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,527
Let's blow something up. Yeah!

89
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,070
Well, Caleb, shall we
let them do what they do?

90
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,117
Only if I can go with them.

91
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,410
Very well.

92
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:55,083
Hey, kid. You ready
for this? We move fast.

93
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,825
Good. That's the
only way I know.

94
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,173
[Wrecker laughs]

95
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,803
I like him.

You must run!

103
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,386
Run, Caleb!

Kid, wait!

108
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,705
What... What just happened?

109
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,921
The comm channel is
repeating one directive,

110
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:24,592
"Execute Order 66."

111
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,461
Yeah, I heard that too.

112
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,428
What's Order 66?

113
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,588
I am not certain.

114
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,518
Echo. Tech. Talk to the reg
Captain. Find out what you can.

115
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:40,186
Crosshair, you and I will track down the
kid and make sure nothing happens to him.

116
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,307
Wrecker, stall anyone
who tries to follow us.

117
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,643
He's close.

Come on down, kid.

00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,855
We're here to help. No!

123
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,443
What are you doing?

124
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,279
Following orders.

125
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:33,373
We don't even know
what the order is.

126
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,454
Stand down until we
know what's going on.

Good soldiers follow orders.

Where's the Padawan?

129
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,925
Yeah, don't worry.
Hunter's handling it.

130
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,182
We have orders from the
Supreme Chancellor himself.

131
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:04,145
That's great, but like I
said, Hunter's handling it.

132
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,559
Step aside, Trooper.

133
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,232
Sure thing, boss.

134
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,859
Hunter, you've got regs inbound.

135
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,321
[Hunter] Copy that.

[Tech] <i>We have a situation.</i>

I don't know, Tech.

<i>All of them. They're saying the
Jedi have committed treason.</i>

141
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,341
[Crosshair] That
would explain things.

142
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:32,722
It doesn't begin
to explain things.

143

[Tech] <i>I suggest
you get back here.</i>

Can't. Haven't
found the kid yet.

Don't!

No! You killed her!

just as confused as you are.

Where's the Jedi?

I stunned him when he
jumped. He didn't make it.

163

We're coming up on Kamino.

It's good to be home.

00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,066
How long has it been?

166
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,315
One hundred and eighty
rotations in a standard cycle,

167
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:42,661
but galactic zone changes put the
adjusted figure at around 205.

168
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,445
What?

169
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,872
[sighs] A long time.

170
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,949
You got that right.

171
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,544
What?

172
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,634
You sure that Padawan
died when he fell?

173
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,127
Sure I'm sure. Why?

174
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:03,180
Well, usually when someone
falls you look down, not across.

175
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,722
Well, some of us
don't like to watch.

176
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,279
[V-wing pilot] <i>Unidentified transport,
transmit your clearance code.</i>

177
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,279
Clearance code? Don't
they know who we are?

178
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,992
Must be a protocol drill.

179
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,159
[thunderclap, thunder rumbling]

180
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,743
Transmitting clearance code.

181
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:33,831
[V-wing pilot] <i>Authorization confirmed.
Proceed to landing bay one-tac-one.</i>

182
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,066
[PA announcer] <i>Level five
lockdown remains in effect...</i>

183
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,661
Shock troopers?

184
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,917
What's the Coruscant
Guard doing here?

185
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:19,249
[PA announcer] <i>Level five
lockdown remains in effect.</i>

186
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:22,336
<i>Security teams, report
to the command center.</i>

187
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,222
This isn't a drill.

188
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,969
Oh, man. What did we miss now?

189
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:28,927
The end of the war.

190
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,887
Say again, Trooper.

191
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,934
General Grievous was
defeated on Utapau.

192
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:37,347
The Separatist leadership has
collapsed. The war is over.

193
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,647
- Just like I said.
- [Wrecker gasps]

194
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,981
It is just like you said.

195
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,289
Is there a problem?

196
00:15:58,124 --> 00:15:59,754
No problem.

197
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,796
We'll just head to
our barracks then.

198
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,220
Best hurry. There's a mandatory
general assembly at 1500.

199
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,979
It's not just the
clones on Kaller.

200
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,192
All the regs are acting strange.

201
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,652
Let's test that theory.

202
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,323
Excuse me, Trooper. What
division are you from?

203
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,402
Step aside.

204
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:29,822
Oh. Well, they seem
the same to me.

205
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:37,956
[Wrecker] Ah!

206
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,709
Good to be back.

207
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:41,461
The smell's getting worse.

208
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,213
You're still new.
You'll get used to it.

209
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,045
[Crosshair] Speak for yourself.

210
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:48,508
Well, I'll get the board.

211
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,892
Eleven more successful missions.

212
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,647
[chuckles] Like
there was any doubt.

213
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:03,612
Kaller wasn't a win.

214
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,435
Says who? We completed
our objective.

215
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,896
Not every objective.

216
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,371
Hunter let that Jedi kid escape.

217
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:18,332
Or do you want to
keep lying to us?

218
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,789
I don't like to think of executing
our commanders as a mission objective.

219
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,457
An order is an order.

220
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,547
Since when?

221
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,255
None of this makes sense.

222
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,636
Those clones served alongside
General Billaba for years.

223
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,064
How could they turn
on her like that?

224
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,693
Because of the regs programming.

225
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,442
What programming?

226
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,152
It's been well documented
that the Kaminoans

227
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,533
inhibited the cognitive
functions of clones

228
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:52,861
to engineer them to follow
orders without question.

229
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,987
Ha! We sure don't.

230
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,115
Obviously, we are different.

231
00:17:57,202 --> 00:18:00,582
They manipulated preexisting
aberrations in our DNA,

232
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,633
resulting in your brute strength,
Crosshair's sharpshooting skills,

233
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:08,459
Hunter's enhanced senses
and my exceptional mind.

234
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:12,427
My guess is we are immune to
the effects of the programming.

235
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,929
Though I can't be
100% certain of it.

236
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:19,604
What about Echo? He was a
reg before he joined us.

237
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:24,523
Yeah, if all regs were programmed,
why didn't I react like the others?

238
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:27,185
The damage you
sustained on Skako Minor

239
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:31,033
most likely wiped out all of your
preset behavioral modifications.

240
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:35,778
You are more machine than
man... percentagewise, at least.

241
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:38,451
[sighs] Lucky me.

242
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,097
[PA announcer] <i>All personnel
report to the staging area</i>

243
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,581
<i>for a briefing on the
state of the Republic.</i>

244
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,205
This is one meeting
I don't want to miss.

245
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,383
First time for everything.

246
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:57,142
[Palpatine] <i>And the Jedi
rebellion has been foiled.</i>

247
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:03,888
<i>The remaining Jedi will be
hunted down and defeated.</i>

248
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,896
<i>The attempt on my life</i>

249
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:12,491
<i>has left me scarred
and deformed.</i>

250
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,239
You can say that again.

251
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,740
<i>But I assure you.</i>

252
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:22,083
<i>My resolve has
never been stronger!</i>

253
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:27,415
<i>In order to ensure the security
and continuing stability...</i>

254
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,670
What is it?

255
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,506
<i>The Republic will be reorganized</i>

256
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,680
- <i>into the first...</i>
- Nothing.

257
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,099
<i>Galactic Empire!</i>

258
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,849
Galactic Empire?

259
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:47,731
<i>For a safe and secure society.</i>

260
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,902
- [cheering, shouting]
- Yeah!

261
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,438
Still don't think the
regs are programmed?

262
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,751
[thunder rumbling]

263
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:13,884
Galactic Empire? We're
soldiers of the Republic.

264
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:18,433
Republic, Empire...
What's the difference?

265
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,430
The systematic termination of
the Jedi is a big one for me.

266
00:20:23,515 --> 00:20:26,135
Lads, we've got company.

267
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,103
Hello.

268
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,444
What's that?

269
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:36,989
Adolescent human female.
Origins... uncertain.

270
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,030
My name's Omega. I was wondering
when you guys would come back.

271
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:44,446
You know who we are?

272
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:48,956
Hunter, Echo, Tech,
Wrecker and Crosshair.

273
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,210
You're Clone Force 99.

274
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,052
What are you doing
on Kamino, kid?

275
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,881
Her job, of course.

276
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,008
She is my medical assistant,

277
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:04,764
one with a curious mind
that causes her to wander.

278
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:08,387
Come, Omega. There
is work to do.

279
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:21,736
This day keeps getting
weirder and weirder.

280
00:21:55,857 --> 00:22:00,357
Admiral Tarkin, this
news is most surprising.

281
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:06,325
Chancellor Palpatine has always supported
our cloning advancements in the past.

282
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:10,579
Emperor Palpatine's
priorities have changed.

283
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,923
With the war at an end, the need for
future clones is being questioned.

284
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,511
Our contracts stipulate
the continued production.

285
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:22,048
Your contracts were with the
Republic, which no longer exists.

286
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:27,143
Surely you realize the precarious
state this newly formed Empire is in.

287
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:31,809
Clone troopers will be needed to
maintain order throughout the galaxy.

288
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:36,937
Indeed. A service conscription soldiers
could provide at half the cost.

289
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:39,983
The skill level and
efficiency of our clones

290
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:44,158
is far superior to that
of any recruited body.

291
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,371
I shall be the judge of
that, Prime Minister.

292
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,222
His shuttle arrived
earlier today.

293
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,679
I heard he's evaluating
all the clones.

294
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:11,182
Good. It's about time some of
the fat got trimmed around here.

295
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:21,403
Clones being programmed.
Nothing controls me.

296
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,030
Wrecker, it is a
logical conclusion

297
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:27,122
that your affinity for destruction
would stem from your conditioning.

298
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,278
You take that back!

299
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:33,747
I am merely stating a scientific
hypothesis based on factual data.

300
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,250
Well, I got a fact for you.

301
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:41,252
I like to blow things up because
I like to blow things up!

302
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:42,915
Got it?

303
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,836
Well, I'm convinced.

304
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,845
An Imperial's been sent
to evaluate the clones.

305
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:50,809
Everybody's talking about it.

306
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,889
What kind of evaluation?

307
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:56,644
Hopefully not mental.
Clearly we'd never pass that.

308
00:23:58,521 --> 00:23:59,611
Hello again.

309
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,953
Omega. From earlier?

310
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,990
In the corridor?

311
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:14,577
Yeah, kid. We remember.

312
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:17,502
Don't you have some place to be?

313
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,793
No. I'll stay.

314
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:23,626
You want to sit with us?
That's never happened before.

315
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,303
Wow.

316
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,143
I like you. You don't fit
in around here either.

317
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,429
What are you really doing
here on Kamino, kid?

318
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,564
Don't you have a family
somewhere? Parents?

319
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,062
Parents?

320
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:42,193
Check it out. The defect squad's
got themselves a new recruit.

321
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,403
[chuckles]

322
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:46,653
Another member added
to the Sad Batch.

323
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,816
[clone troopers laughing]

324
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:49,905
What the...

325
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,277
Who threw that?

326
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:57,291
I did. Now apologize
to my friends.

327
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,582
I like this kid!

328
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,876
What did you say to me?

329
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,340
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back off.

330
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:07,261
I suggest you keep moving.

331
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,178
[scoffs]

332
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,475
Know your place, lab scrabber.

333
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,023
[grunts]

334
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,990
Oops.

335
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:28,569
That's it.

336
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:29,823
Oh, yeah!

337
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,529
[clone troopers shouting]

338
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,575
Oh, not again.

339
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,516
Echo, watch out.

340
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,981
[Echo groaning]

341
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:11,448
[AZI-3] But mistress Nala Se summoned
you to the sub-level medical wing.

342
00:26:11,529 --> 00:26:13,449
- You must go.
- [Omega] No.

343
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,621
I'm staying here
until he wakes up.

344
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,369
Whe... Where?

345
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:22,622
[grunting, groaning]

346
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,338
No! Get them off!

347
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:30,009
But my tests are
not yet complete.

348
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:34,140
Echo. Echo, it's... It's
okay. It's me. Omega.

349
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:36,264
I understand.

350
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,806
I don't like being hooked
up to their machines either.

351
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,273
Hello, CT-1409.

352
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:44,022
His name is Echo.

353
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:51,034
I am AZI-345211896246498721347,

354
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,821
your assigned medical droid.

355
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:55,204
Ha! Told you he's alive!

356
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:57,451
You owe me two credits.

357
00:26:57,534 --> 00:27:00,294
CT-1409's condition is stable.

358
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:03,000
But I have some distressing
news for the rest of you.

359
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,285
According to your test results,

360
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:09,295
you all appear to be
genetically defective clones.

361
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,675
I will leave you to process
the shock of this revelation.

362
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,469
We've got a problem.

363
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:22,346
Not really. We're more
deviant than we are defective.

364
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:26,064
Not that. Admiral Tarkin's here.

365
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,396
He's the one
evaluating the clones.

366
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:32,191
The same Tarkin from the
Citadel rescue when you, uh...

367
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:34,697
- How shall I put this?
- Blew up.

368
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:36,699
And turned into that.

369
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,581
[sighs] Yes.

370
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,999
And he's not a big
supporter of clones.

371
00:27:42,078 --> 00:27:46,118
We'll soon find out. We've been
summoned by the prime minister.

372
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:50,797
Guess he didn't find that mess
hall fight amusing. But I sure did.

373
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,302
Come on. Let's get
this over with.

374
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:58,469
Wait.

375
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:01,933
The fight was my
fault. I'm going too.

376
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:05,055
Not happening.
We'll handle this.

377
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:06,393
- But I...
- Listen, kid.

378
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,478
Our squad's nothing but trouble.

379
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:11,113
For your sake,
keep your distance.

380
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,361
Got it?

381
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:26,831
Where do you think you're going?
The training facility is that way.

382
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:29,079
Training facility?

383
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:31,167
For a battle simulation.

384
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:34,462
Admiral Tarkin has requested to
see more of your squad in action.

385
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:36,677
Then we are not
being reprimanded?

386
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:39,338
No, you're being tested.

387
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:40,597
Now, go gear up.

388
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:45,676
So, we're not in trouble, and
they want us to fight more?

389
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:50,189
Ha! Maybe this Empire
thing's not so bad after all.

390
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:06,615
The value of all clone troopers
is being challenged by the Empire.

391
00:29:06,705 --> 00:29:11,245
To demonstrate your effectiveness, a
combat-proficiency test is in order.

392
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,211
Take your positions.

393
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:17,014
We've done these a thousand
times, boys. You know what to do.

394
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:21,507
A battle simulation?
Give us a real challenge.

395
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,220
You may begin.

396
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:28,386
- [beeping]
- [whirring]

397
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:44,866
Crosshair, take the towers.

398
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:14,685
Move in.

399
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:16,323
[Wrecker] Finally!

400
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:19,902
I'll cover you.

401
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,039
This is taking way too long!

402
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,793
[shouts]

403
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,390
Huh? Huh? [Laughing]

404
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:51,688
What else ya got? Gimme more!

405
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:56,765
If the Galactic Empire is to be stronger
than the Republic which preceded it,

406
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:59,026
it's soldiers must follow suit.

407
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:01,109
Switch to live fire.

408
00:31:01,194 --> 00:31:04,244
Admiral Tarkin, I must protest.

409
00:31:04,322 --> 00:31:09,202
Live rounds could damage
my clones and my facility.

410
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:12,745
For which you will be
fairly compensated. Do it!

411
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:27,851
[Wrecker laughs]

412
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:31,059
New toys. Now we're talking.

413
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:35,984
Yeah!

414
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:38,357
Huh?

415
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:44,068
[groans]

416
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:46,406
They're using live rounds.

417
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:47,909
Get Wrecker. We'll cover you.

418
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,918
Wrecker, are you all right?

419
00:31:58,001 --> 00:32:00,171
[groans] I felt that one.

420
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:24,318
[Hunter] Fall back.

421
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:33,615
[Crosshair] This is going well.

422
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,250
[Echo] These training
blasters are useless on them.

423
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,171
[Hunter] Then we improvise.

424
00:32:38,249 --> 00:32:41,419
If Tarkin wants to test us,
let's not disappoint him.

425
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:43,462
[whistles]

426
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,640
Oh! I hate hand signals.

427
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,471
Perhaps if you memorized them.

428
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:55,136
Why don't you memorize them?

429
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:56,225
I have.

430
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,610
What we did on Felucia.

431
00:33:01,147 --> 00:33:02,817
Well, why didn't
you just say that?

432
00:33:15,328 --> 00:33:16,328
Incoming.

433
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,972
Reprogramming this thing will
be pointless if you crush it.

434
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,387
You better be right about this.

435
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:42,983
These are rather
unusual tactics.

436
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:46,185
The clones of
experimental Unit 99

437
00:33:46,276 --> 00:33:50,196
have a tendency to veer from
standard combat protocol.

438
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,122
[grunting]

439
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:57,202
Hurry up.

440
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,209
Done. Let him go.

441
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:00,869
[device beeping]

442
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,321
[grunting]

443
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:32,954
- Wrecker. Look alive.
- Huh?

444
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:37,951
Stay down!

445
00:34:39,245 --> 00:34:41,075
I can't sustain the connection.

446
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,335
- [groans]
- Tech!

447
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,349
Crosshair, we need
more cover fire.

448
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,649
[Wrecker] Tech!
Hold tight, buddy.

449
00:35:06,731 --> 00:35:09,441
I'm not going anywhere.

450
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:14,318
Wrecker, knife.

451
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:24,083
[powers down]

452
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,460
Wow.

453
00:35:31,673 --> 00:35:32,673
Nice work.

454
00:35:58,324 --> 00:36:00,834
[Nala] Extraordinary,
aren't they?

455
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:05,997
That remains to be seen.
Tell me about Clone Force 99.

456
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,963
They are medically
defective clones

457
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:14,054
whose cellular mutations enhanced
traits desirable in a soldier.

458
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:19,345
How many of these enhanced
clones do you possess?

459
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:22,348
Five are all that remain.

460
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,189
They could be an asset
to your new Empire.

461
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:30,269
Yet reports indicate they
exhibit a concerning level

462
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:32,937
of disobedience and
disregard for orders.

463
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:35,316
A side effect of their mutation.

464
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:39,623
Yet one that has never hindered
the completion of their missions.

465
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,620
Then they executed Order 66?

466
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:49,672
Since both the Jedi General and
Padawan on Kaller were eliminated,

467
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:50,921
one would assume.

468
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:54,592
Assume nothing. Only the
general's death is confirmed.

469
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:59,756
A counter-report, filed by one of
their own, says the Padawan escaped.

470
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:03,848
Let us see where the loyalty
of these clones truly lies.

471
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:15,987
Live rounds? They used
live rounds! On us!

472
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:18,149
We were there, Wrecker. We know.

473
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,738
I tried to warn
you about Tarkin.

474
00:37:20,323 --> 00:37:23,083
Who's that Imperial
snake think he is?

475
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:27,749
Stow it, already. You got
shot. It happens all the time.

476
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,843
There's a fundamental difference
between taking fire in battle

477
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:34,168
and being used for
target practice.

478
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:37,384
Exactly! We're not dummy droids.

479
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:38,875
That much we agree on.

480
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:49,886
That was quite an
impressive display.

481
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:51,938
Didn't have much choice.

482
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:56,942
Our new empire may have methods
which seem a bit unorthodox,

483
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,987
but so does this squadron.

484
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,990
Both certainly
have their merits.

485
00:38:01,781 --> 00:38:05,161
Nala Se speaks quite highly
of her five enhanced clones.

486
00:38:05,243 --> 00:38:08,083
She claims you're more
capable than an army.

487
00:38:08,163 --> 00:38:10,793
You have a mission for us, sir?

488
00:38:11,374 --> 00:38:15,884
Indeed. We have tracked a group of
insurgents to the Onderon sector.

489
00:38:15,962 --> 00:38:17,552
They must be dealt with.

490
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,380
What sort of insurgents?

491
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:24,263
Separatist forces intent on
keeping the galaxy at war.

492
00:38:24,346 --> 00:38:28,886
If you neutralize this grave threat,
you will be looked upon most favorably

493
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:31,725
as I assess the needs
of the Imperial Army.

494
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:49,834
Find any more intel
on the insurgents?

495
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:53,083
Negative. Imperial files
are locked down tight.

496
00:38:53,166 --> 00:38:55,336
Give me time. I'll crack them.

497
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:59,625
I'll say this for the
Empire, they know firepower.

498
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:01,804
You should see the new armory.

499
00:39:01,883 --> 00:39:03,763
He actually cried.

500
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:05,603
Hey, we both did.

501
00:39:06,179 --> 00:39:07,679
There's no room
on board for that.

502
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:10,564
Yeah? Well, I'll make room.

503
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:11,812
[sighs]

504
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:15,113
A new mission and
unlimited explosives.

505
00:39:15,188 --> 00:39:17,228
Things are back to normal.

506
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:21,315
That's not going near my rack. I
refuse to sleep by a projectile again.

507
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:25,656
[Omega] Hunter.

508
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:29,075
I told you to keep
your distance.

509
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:31,833
I know, but I need
to talk to you.

510
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:34,543
All right. What is it?

511
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:40,010
That Imperial officer, I
think he has it out for you.

512
00:39:40,088 --> 00:39:43,968
I overheard him talking to Lama
Su. He doesn't like clones.

513
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,180
[chuckles]

514
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,680
Ah, that's nothing new for
us. But we get the job done.

515
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:50,643
I don't trust him.

516
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:54,644
A mission's a mission. It's
nothing to worry about.

517
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,975
Then let me come with you.

518
00:39:57,522 --> 00:40:01,032
Kid, you're not a
soldier. It's dangerous.

519
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:03,399
It's dangerous here too.

520
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:06,606
Things aren't like before.
We need to leave Kamino.

521
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,528
[Wrecker] Hunter, let's go!

522
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:14,366
Change takes getting used to.
You'll see. Just give it time.

523
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,710
Hunter.

524
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:24,125
Um, n-never mind.

525
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,098
Problem?

526
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:35,562
Um, something about
her I can't figure out.

527
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:43,686
Well, I guess kids aren't
your area of expertise.

528
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:06,633
Omega. Come along.

529
00:41:06,716 --> 00:41:08,546
I told you to stay close.

530
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:40,424
[creature roaring]

531
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,790
[Echo] What was that?

532
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:43,376
[Tech] You don't want to know.

533
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:45,421
[Wrecker] Well, at
least it's not a swamp.

534
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:47,295
[Crosshair] Close enough.

535
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:49,972
[Hunter] The Separatist
encampment's two klicks south.

536
00:41:50,051 --> 00:41:52,641
We'll continue on foot and
do a full perimeter scan.

537
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:56,346
Covertly.

538
00:41:56,433 --> 00:42:00,773
Oh, come on. It's been days
since I've blown something up.

539
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:03,234
Easy, Wrecker. Your
programming's kicking in.

540
00:42:03,314 --> 00:42:05,234
Hey, don't start with that!

541
00:42:06,317 --> 00:42:08,237
[grumbles]

542
00:42:09,738 --> 00:42:12,448
[creatures chirping, chittering]

543
00:42:12,532 --> 00:42:16,542
[scanner beeping]

544
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:28,336
[Hunter] How many droids
are we talking about, Tech?

545
00:42:28,715 --> 00:42:32,545
I can't tell from this distance.
Something's blocking my scan.

546
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:35,005
[Hunter] Clankers
always travel in packs.

547
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:37,386
Let's get a closer look at
what we're walking into.

548
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:01,081
[Hunter] Tell me
what you see, Tech.

549
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:05,254
I'm clocking 25 heat signatures
ahead but zero droids.

550
00:43:06,086 --> 00:43:10,006
[Crosshair] Tarkin said
insurgents, not droids.

551
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,220
[Echo] I'm not sure
they're either.

552
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:17,684
There are children down there.

553
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:20,184
[Hunter] Children? Out here?

554
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,900
Something's not right.

555
00:43:24,688 --> 00:43:26,168
[Crosshair] What
are you waiting for?

556
00:43:26,606 --> 00:43:28,606
Give the order.

557
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:32,032
- [Hunter] Negative. Stand down.
- What?

558
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:35,032
[Wrecker] You mean, we're
not blasting any droids?

559
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,775
[Tech] There aren't
any droids, Wrecker.

560
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:38,946
[Wrecker] Well,
so what do we do?

561
00:43:39,035 --> 00:43:41,325
[Crosshair] We
finish the mission.

562
00:43:41,413 --> 00:43:43,373
Make the call, Hunter.

563
00:43:44,624 --> 00:43:46,294
We're not alone.

564
00:43:46,876 --> 00:43:48,376
Now stand down.

565
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:59,602
You heard him. Stand down.

566
00:44:00,849 --> 00:44:04,559
Let's hear them out. Trust me.

567
00:44:10,275 --> 00:44:12,275
[sighs]

568
00:44:41,389 --> 00:44:43,599
These aren't Separatists.

569
00:44:43,683 --> 00:44:45,563
They're Republic fighters.

570
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:49,146
Why would Tarkin send us
to attack our own forces?

571
00:44:50,398 --> 00:44:53,148
Because we refuse to
fight for an Empire.

572
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:55,782
You're Saw Gerrera.

573
00:44:56,446 --> 00:45:00,446
Trained by Captain Rex and General
Skywalker to fight for the Republic.

574
00:45:12,545 --> 00:45:18,425
So, the newly declared empire
sent you to wipe us out?

575
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:21,472
Well, we're here to neutralize
a group of insurgents.

576
00:45:21,554 --> 00:45:23,014
[chuckles]

577
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,478
Well... here we are.

578
00:45:25,558 --> 00:45:26,938
What are you gonna do?

579
00:45:27,018 --> 00:45:29,648
Strike us down like
you did the Jedi?

580
00:45:29,729 --> 00:45:31,729
Is that a request?

581
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:32,855
Enough.

582
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:35,941
We expected to find
battle droids, not...

583
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:40,527
Civilians? Times
change, targets change.

584
00:45:40,615 --> 00:45:44,615
Why don't you take a look at the
insurgents you were sent to destroy?

585
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:53,125
Makes you wonder what
else they're lying about.

586
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:57,466
Let's mobilize.
Pack up the camp.

587
00:46:04,347 --> 00:46:07,557
What's going on here?
Who are these people?

588
00:46:08,518 --> 00:46:12,688
Villagers, croppers,
former Republic fighters,

589
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:18,952
all now displaced refugees since Palpatine
unjustly appointed himself Emperor.

590
00:46:19,529 --> 00:46:24,659
According to reports, the Jedi made an
attempt on the Supreme Chancellor's life.

591
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:27,543
His actions were a
defensive measure.

592
00:46:28,163 --> 00:46:29,833
And I figured you
for the smart one.

593
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:34,502
With the Jedi decimated and the
clone army under his command,

594
00:46:34,586 --> 00:46:38,376
Palpatine will have control
over the entire galaxy.

595
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:40,295
Unless we stop him.

596
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,353
The war is over.

597
00:46:43,928 --> 00:46:47,388
If we give up now,
everything we fought for

598
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:51,561
everyone we lost, will
have been for nothing.

599
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:54,305
I won't let that happen.

600
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:59,397
The Clone War may have ended, but
a civil war is about to begin.

601
00:47:00,153 --> 00:47:04,663
With a handful of fighters and limited
firepower? You don't stand a chance.

602
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:06,451
Not alone we don't.

603
00:47:06,993 --> 00:47:09,293
We should leave if we're
gonna make the rendezvous.

604
00:47:09,913 --> 00:47:11,163
What do we do with them?

605
00:47:15,168 --> 00:47:20,838
The clones once helped us free
Onderon, so we'll give them a choice.

606
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:23,474
The old ways are done.

607
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:27,851
You can either adapt and
survive, or die with the past.

608
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:29,973
The decision is yours.

609
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:14,140
[droid chatter]

610
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:24,321
[Tech] At least with the
Republic we knew where we stood.

611
00:48:24,988 --> 00:48:29,028
Tarkin and this Empire are
a whole different story.

612
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:32,947
Why are we debating this? We
need to complete the mission.

613
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:37,745
Wake up, Crosshair. They sent us
to eliminate innocent civilians.

614
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:39,504
Who said they're innocent?

615
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:40,916
What's wrong with you?

616
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:43,973
Me? I'm following orders.

617
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:45,969
Exactly.

618
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:48,681
Those insurgents are
plotting against the Emperor.

619
00:48:49,387 --> 00:48:53,097
If you don't have the stomach
to do what needs to be done,

620
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:56,693
then you're not fit
to lead this squad.

621
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:03,033
[branch snaps]

622
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:09,199
We're being followed.

623
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:17,422
[Tech] That is a probe droid.

624
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:19,499
[Wrecker] Tarkin's
spying on us now?

625
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:21,591
The Jedi never did that.

626
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,550
[Crosshair] Not
that you know of.

627
00:49:26,508 --> 00:49:27,508
Omega.

628
00:49:28,218 --> 00:49:29,468
What about her?

629
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:33,095
She warned me about the
mission. And Tarkin.

630
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:37,771
She said not to return to Kamino,
that it's not safe for us anymore.

631
00:49:37,852 --> 00:49:40,442
[Wrecker grunts]
Maybe she's right.

632
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:43,942
We're taking the
word of a child now?

633
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:46,362
I would not discount
Omega's insight.

634
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:49,445
A state of heightened
awareness is not unusual

635
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:52,201
for an enhanced clone
such as herself.

636
00:49:52,283 --> 00:49:55,833
[laughs] Good one,
Tech. You almost had me.

637
00:49:55,912 --> 00:49:58,332
When Nala Se spoke
of five clones,

638
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:01,875
Tarkin assumed that meant
us, but Echo's a reg.

639
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,920
The fifth is Omega.

640
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:08,724
I confirmed my suspicions after analyzing
her DNA while we were in the infirmary.

641
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,640
And you waited until
now to mention it?

642
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,680
Well, I thought it was obvious.

643
00:50:13,763 --> 00:50:15,773
How is it obvious?

644
00:50:16,307 --> 00:50:17,727
We're going back for her.

645
00:50:19,894 --> 00:50:23,864
Disobeying orders
again over a kid?

646
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:26,150
Bad play, Hunter.

647
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:36,953
She's one of us. We're
not leaving her there.

648
00:50:41,583 --> 00:50:44,093
[engine starting]

649
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:51,684
[thunder rumbling]

650
00:50:52,594 --> 00:50:53,894
Wow.

651
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:57,311
What is all this stuff, AZI?

652
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:00,520
My scanners are indicating
an assortment of armament,

653
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:03,902
curios and detritus
of little to no value.

654
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,610
I like it.

655
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,570
We should not be here, Omega.

656
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:10,360
Nala Se instructed us to
stay in the medical wing.

657
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:14,525
Don't worry. We're on...
a research assignment.

658
00:51:14,616 --> 00:51:19,076
A research assignment?
Those are my favorite.

659
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:22,252
What is it we are
searching for? Is it this?

660
00:51:23,291 --> 00:51:24,581
[object clatters]

661
00:51:24,668 --> 00:51:26,418
What about this?

662
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:29,213
[AZI-3] Or this?

663
00:51:31,424 --> 00:51:32,434
Is it this?

664
00:51:33,468 --> 00:51:34,468
Perhaps this?

665
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:37,846
What about this?

666
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,240
This is a curious keepsake.

667
00:51:53,196 --> 00:51:54,566
[screams]

668
00:51:55,573 --> 00:51:58,243
Shh! People will hear us.

669
00:51:58,326 --> 00:52:01,246
I have concluded this space
is unfit for habitation.

670
00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:03,329
[shock troopers
chattering, faint]

671
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:07,593
Someone is coming. Time to go.

672
00:52:11,715 --> 00:52:13,715
You're not authorized
to be in here.

673
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,840
I... got lost.

674
00:52:15,927 --> 00:52:17,257
Sorry. It won't happen again.

675
00:52:17,887 --> 00:52:20,057
Pack up their gear and
take it to the hangar.

676
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,930
You, you're coming with me.

677
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:24,557
We will not. We are official
Kaminoan medical personnel...

678
00:52:24,644 --> 00:52:25,904
Don't touch me, droid.

679
00:52:26,312 --> 00:52:27,942
- [screams]
- AZI!

680
00:52:40,618 --> 00:52:45,168
I'm getting no response from
com-scan. This is unusual.

681
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:48,208
Bring us in. We'll find
out what's going on.

682
00:53:12,317 --> 00:53:15,897
[thunderclap, thunder rumbling]

683
00:53:17,906 --> 00:53:19,406
Stick to the plan.

684
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:22,741
Split up, find Omega, meet
back here at the ship.

685
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:46,475
Freeze!

686
00:53:50,689 --> 00:53:52,519
As expected.

687
00:53:57,737 --> 00:54:00,697
The Empire does not
tolerate failure, Sergeant.

688
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:03,622
There were complications.

689
00:54:03,702 --> 00:54:06,792
Yes, the probe droid's
report was quite detailed.

690
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:09,964
Conspiring with Saw Gerrera.

691
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:12,751
I assume you know the
punishment for treason.

692
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:14,336
Treason?

693
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:16,171
Throw them in the brig.

694
00:54:33,106 --> 00:54:34,396
[sniffs]

695
00:54:34,482 --> 00:54:35,732
Smells weird.

696
00:54:35,817 --> 00:54:37,317
Because it's clean.

697
00:54:37,819 --> 00:54:39,609
Well, the plan wasn't
a total failure.

698
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:44,164
Goody.

699
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:47,906
I warned you not to come back.

700
00:54:47,996 --> 00:54:50,666
Had to. We were looking for you.

701
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:53,247
Me?

702
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:54,995
What do you say, kid?

703
00:54:55,086 --> 00:54:58,416
You wanna come with us or did
we get captured for nothing?

704
00:54:58,506 --> 00:55:00,966
You came back for me?

705
00:55:01,051 --> 00:55:04,641
That's right. Or you
can stay on Kamino if...

706
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:08,311
No, it's like I said before.
I want to go with you.

707
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:11,482
How touching.

708
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:15,234
[clears throat]

709
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:18,735
Uh, Hunter, how are we
breaking outta here?

710
00:55:18,818 --> 00:55:20,648
I'm working on it.

711
00:55:20,737 --> 00:55:23,067
You know what you
should work on?

712
00:55:23,156 --> 00:55:25,406
Explaining when you went soft.

713
00:55:25,492 --> 00:55:26,912
Stow it, Crosshair.

714
00:55:26,993 --> 00:55:30,793
Don't you see we're locked
up in here because of him?

715
00:55:30,872 --> 00:55:32,622
He had us disobey orders.

716
00:55:32,707 --> 00:55:35,837
I never thought you disobeying
orders was a problem.

717
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:38,379
Yeah. We do it all the time.

718
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:40,673
Good soldiers follow orders.

719
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:44,087
Every choice you've made
since Kaller has been wrong.

720
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:47,928
First the Padawan, then Gerrera.

721
00:55:48,014 --> 00:55:50,354
You're becoming a liability.

722
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:52,850
We can debate my choices later.

723
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:55,766
For now, let's focus
on getting outta here.

724
00:56:02,612 --> 00:56:04,112
[exhales]

725
00:56:07,158 --> 00:56:08,238
[Omega] You're angry.

726
00:56:12,497 --> 00:56:14,827
How perceptive.

727
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:20,090
I know what you're going
to do, but please don't.

728
00:56:20,171 --> 00:56:22,091
What do you know?

729
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:26,392
I know it's not your fault.

730
00:56:27,846 --> 00:56:29,096
You can't help it.

731
00:56:34,269 --> 00:56:36,479
CT-9904, you're coming with us.

732
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,863
Oh, no, no, no.
We stay together.

733
00:56:41,067 --> 00:56:42,067
Stand down!

734
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:15,189
Well, what is his status?

735
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:22,320
CT-9904's genetic mutations have
altered much of his cranial activity,

736
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,440
including his inhibitor chip.

737
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:29,281
Yet he exhibited loyalty to the
Empire during their mission.

738
00:57:29,366 --> 00:57:33,366
While the chip is not as
active as a standard clone's,

739
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:36,003
the order does
appear to be working.

740
00:57:36,081 --> 00:57:39,461
Can you intensify
the programming?

741
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:40,712
Yes.

742
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:42,214
Then proceed.

743
00:57:44,464 --> 00:57:47,684
[whirring]

744
00:57:52,555 --> 00:57:56,015
[beeping]

745
00:58:24,295 --> 00:58:27,215
I've got it. Why didn't
I think of it before?

746
00:58:27,298 --> 00:58:29,128
This is not a prison.

747
00:58:29,217 --> 00:58:30,967
Yeah, well, I beg to differ.

748
00:58:31,052 --> 00:58:35,062
This is a Kaminoan facility. It
was built prior to the Clone Wars.

749
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,730
There were no barracks or
prisons when it was constructed.

750
00:58:38,393 --> 00:58:39,983
Well, how does that help us?

751
00:58:40,061 --> 00:58:44,321
Because while these cells were
retrofitted to hold normal individuals,

752
00:58:44,399 --> 00:58:48,399
they could not possibly account
for someone like Wrecker.

753
00:58:48,486 --> 00:58:51,026
Oh! You mean I could
punch our way out?

754
00:58:52,157 --> 00:58:53,657
- Shh!
- Shh!

755
00:58:53,742 --> 00:58:55,332
Oh. Right.

756
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:57,620
[whispers] You mean I
could punch our way out?

757
00:58:57,704 --> 00:59:00,004
If you punch the correct spot.

758
00:59:00,081 --> 00:59:01,671
Right. Show me where.

759
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:06,250
If this is gonna work, we'll
need some cover. Form a wall.

760
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:19,137
Hit this. Here.

761
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:21,435
Right.

762
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:28,487
Tell me when.

763
00:59:29,694 --> 00:59:30,694
Now.

764
00:59:37,035 --> 00:59:38,655
[grumbles]

765
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:39,905
Nothing happened.

766
00:59:40,538 --> 00:59:42,288
Are you sure this is gonna work?

767
00:59:42,374 --> 00:59:44,634
Try it again. A little harder.

768
00:59:45,794 --> 00:59:48,004
You're all clear. Make it count.

769
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:49,378
Okay.

770
00:59:58,264 --> 00:59:59,934
[chattering, faint]

771
01:00:00,016 --> 01:00:01,976
Oh, it still didn't work.

772
01:00:07,315 --> 01:00:09,025
Oh, yes, it did.

773
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:10,189
Look.

774
01:00:12,445 --> 01:00:14,775
I'll never fit through that.

775
01:00:14,864 --> 01:00:18,794
Astute as always, Wrecker, but I
was actually going to suggest...

776
01:00:18,868 --> 01:00:19,868
I'll do it.

777
01:00:20,787 --> 01:00:22,037
You sure, kid?

778
01:00:22,706 --> 01:00:23,746
I'm sure.

779
01:00:24,582 --> 01:00:29,302
Okay. Get to the console and hit
the lever to lower the ray shield.

780
01:00:35,635 --> 01:00:36,795
Incoming.

781
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:41,599
Wait, where's the girl?

782
01:00:41,683 --> 01:00:43,183
You tell us.

783
01:00:43,268 --> 01:00:45,348
Harm her and you're a dead man.

784
01:00:45,437 --> 01:00:48,517
Operations, we need a status
report on prisoner 0219.

785
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:52,529
[clank]

786
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:53,650
What was that?

787
01:00:53,737 --> 01:00:54,737
Sorry.

788
01:00:54,821 --> 01:00:58,531
These floors don't hold me
so well on account of them

789
01:00:58,616 --> 01:01:03,036
not being designed for abnormal
individuals such as myself.

790
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:05,497
What's behind you?

791
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:07,082
Nothing.

792
01:01:07,167 --> 01:01:09,207
Move away from the wall. Now.

793
01:01:09,294 --> 01:01:11,134
Why don't you come
here and make me?

794
01:01:11,212 --> 01:01:12,592
[comm beeps]

795
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:15,512
Copy that. The girl's still
registered in lockdown.

796
01:01:15,592 --> 01:01:17,012
Tell us where she is.

797
01:01:20,472 --> 01:01:21,472
Hit the switch, Omega!

798
01:01:25,894 --> 01:01:27,404
Ah! [Grunts]

799
01:01:27,479 --> 01:01:28,479
Get off!

800
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:30,731
Hey, Red.

801
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:41,491
Ha! Not bad.

802
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:47,043
We need to find out where they
took Crosshair. Let's move.

803
01:02:10,271 --> 01:02:13,321
[sighs] We're not going to
get very far without our gear.

804
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:17,697
They started moving all your things to
the hangar. Your gear might be there too.

805
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:19,822
This way.

806
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:37,335
All right, boys, suit up.
Let's make this quick.

807
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:45,143
Right. No. No! Where
is it? Where is it?

808
01:02:45,223 --> 01:02:46,643
[grunting]

809
01:02:46,725 --> 01:02:48,225
It's gotta be here somewhere.

810
01:02:53,648 --> 01:02:57,068
Tech, power up the ship. The rest
of us will go after Crosshair.

811
01:03:09,497 --> 01:03:11,747
I don't think we'll
have to go far.

812
01:03:18,381 --> 01:03:20,801
Is that Crosshair?

813
01:03:34,856 --> 01:03:37,026
Best stand down, Sergeant.

814
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:39,439
Make it easy on yourself.

815
01:03:39,527 --> 01:03:40,897
Have you lost your mind?

816
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:44,405
We should've killed that Jedi.

817
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:47,491
You disobeyed orders.

818
01:03:48,244 --> 01:03:50,294
I did what I thought was right.

819
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:52,962
You never could see
the bigger picture.

820
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:54,918
Now surrender.

821
01:04:01,299 --> 01:04:02,719
Is that an order?

822
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:04,720
Heh.

823
01:04:05,470 --> 01:04:07,310
I guess it is.

824
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:12,308
Well, I guess I'm
disobeying that one too.

825
01:04:18,191 --> 01:04:19,191
[spits]

826
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:28,369
[thunderclap, thunder rumbling]

827
01:04:59,065 --> 01:05:00,775
Tech, we gotta move. Now!

828
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:01,859
I'm working on it.

829
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:04,032
Wrecker, clear the
smoke on three.

830
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:05,612
You got it, boss.

831
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,120
Omega, stay low.

832
01:05:09,534 --> 01:05:13,124
One... two...

833
01:05:13,747 --> 01:05:15,077
Three!

834
01:05:23,923 --> 01:05:25,513
[groans]

835
01:05:27,635 --> 01:05:28,755
[Hunter] Omega, don't!

836
01:05:29,846 --> 01:05:31,306
He's using Wrecker as bait.

837
01:05:31,389 --> 01:05:32,809
But he needs help.

838
01:05:33,266 --> 01:05:35,726
- Tech, we're out of time.
- Almost got it.

839
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:43,068
Seal the bay doors!

840
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:46,612
[beeps]

841
01:05:46,696 --> 01:05:49,486
[metal clunking]

842
01:05:49,574 --> 01:05:50,574
[alarm blaring]

843
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:56,995
- [blaring continues]
- Sir, someone's overriding the controls.

844
01:06:01,795 --> 01:06:05,215
When I say "go," you head for
that ramp and don't stop. Got it?

845
01:06:06,341 --> 01:06:07,511
Echo, we go for Wrecker.

846
01:06:09,886 --> 01:06:12,056
[Crosshair] Only
one way out, Hunter.

847
01:06:12,138 --> 01:06:14,348
Your move.

848
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:16,228
Go!

849
01:07:04,607 --> 01:07:05,607
[beeps]

850
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:18,121
Has the matter been rectified?

851
01:07:18,204 --> 01:07:21,884
The inhibitor chip
augmentation was a success.

852
01:07:21,958 --> 01:07:27,708
However, the remaining clones
of squad 99 have escaped,

853
01:07:28,465 --> 01:07:30,465
along with Omega.

854
01:07:31,217 --> 01:07:34,427
Mmm. We must be cautious.

855
01:07:34,512 --> 01:07:39,522
Until the Empire's intentions
are made clear, say nothing.

856
01:07:40,185 --> 01:07:42,435
Yes, Prime Minister.

857
01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:01,076
Ouch!

858
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:04,084
Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
What's that gonna do?

859
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:06,167
You'll be okay. Just hold still.

860
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,335
[Omega] Is this what
you were looking for?

861
01:08:09,422 --> 01:08:10,632
[gasps]

862
01:08:10,715 --> 01:08:12,335
You found my Lula!

863
01:08:12,425 --> 01:08:14,335
- Ow!
- [giggling]

864
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:16,600
[scanner beeps]

865
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,350
Let's see here. Hold still.

866
01:08:19,432 --> 01:08:22,022
Don't examine me.
I'm not a computer.

867
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:23,902
- This will take just a second.
- [beeping]

868
01:08:23,978 --> 01:08:26,398
Get that thing away
from me. [Grunts]

869
01:08:47,085 --> 01:08:49,335
Your first time in space?

870
01:08:50,672 --> 01:08:53,512
First time anywhere.

871
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:59,223
Impressive shot back there.

872
01:08:59,305 --> 01:09:01,055
Where'd you learn to do that?

873
01:09:01,683 --> 01:09:03,143
I don't know.

874
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:05,806
I never fired a blaster before.

875
01:09:05,895 --> 01:09:06,975
I guess I got lucky.

876
01:09:07,063 --> 01:09:08,943
She's not the only one.

877
01:09:09,024 --> 01:09:10,444
I'm fine.

878
01:09:10,525 --> 01:09:13,775
It'll take more than a blaster
shot to take me down. [Chuckles]

879
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:15,282
You were down.

880
01:09:15,363 --> 01:09:17,873
Yeah, well, not
for long. [Laughs]

881
01:09:17,949 --> 01:09:19,239
[groans]

882
01:09:19,325 --> 01:09:21,075
What's the plan, Hunter?

883
01:09:21,161 --> 01:09:25,001
I thought we could go
off on our own. Lay low.

884
01:09:25,582 --> 01:09:29,382
But with Crosshair gunning
for us, I'm not so sure.

885
01:09:29,461 --> 01:09:32,511
What about your friends?
Could any of them help us?

886
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:34,879
That would be a short list.

887
01:09:36,426 --> 01:09:38,346
I can think of one.

888
01:09:38,428 --> 01:09:40,928
Plot a course for J-19.

889
01:09:41,014 --> 01:09:42,104
J-19?

890
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:44,266
We know a guy.

891
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:46,601
[laughs] Yeah!

892
01:09:47,645 --> 01:09:51,145
Strap in, kid. You're not
gonna wanna miss this view.

893
01:09:59,115 --> 01:10:02,035
[beeping]
