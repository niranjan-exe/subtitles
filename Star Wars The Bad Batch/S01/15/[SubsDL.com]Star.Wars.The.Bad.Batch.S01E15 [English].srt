1
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,437
Where are we going?

2
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,516
You'll find out soon enough.
[comm beeps]

3
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,687
And so will your squad.

4
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,446
Using my comm won't work.
They'll know it's a trap.

5
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,445
They'll still come for you.

6
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,209
Spanner wrench.
[Omega grunts]

7
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,956
This is taking too long.

8
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,928
Omega, focus.

9
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,048
I can't.

10
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,804
We have to get back
to Daro and rescue Hunter.

11
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:39,847
We will, but we can't go anywhere
until the ship's fixed.

12
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,273
Hand me the spanner.

13
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,351
[Gonky honks]

14
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:46,855
[grunts]

15
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,532
That should do it.

16
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,744
The hull's patched.

17
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,899
Nearly finished getting
the systems online.

18
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:56,157
I left Gregor with Cid.
She wasn't too happy about it.

19
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:57,831
[Echo] What else is new?

20
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:58,909
We are up and running.

21
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:00,753
Let's go get Hunter.

22
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,539
[console beeping]

23
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,633
His communication device
has just been activated.

24
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,590
It appears he is no longer on Daro.

25
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,505
What do you mean? Where is he?

26
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,866
Where are the rest of them?

27
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,831
They'll be here.

28
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,661
We'll intercept upon arrival.

29
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,541
So you're the one they call "Hunter."

30
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:52,048
The destruction your squad caused
on Ryloth got my attention.

31
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,594
I leave this to you, Commander.

32
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,472
Stay on schedule.

33
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:09,734
I question the clone's motives
with his old squad.

34
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,524
I don't trust any of them.

35
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:15,108
If his plan fails, none of them
will be a problem any longer.

36
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,695
Keep an eye on things.

37
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,860
Yes, Admiral.

38
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,333
Activating Hunter's comm was intentional.

39
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,746
The Empire wants us to come to Kamino.

40
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,209
I am uncertain as to why.

41
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,046
No turning back now.

42
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,221
Are you positive about these coordinates?

43
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,640
Yes. I told you. They're to a landing pad
that we can use in Tipoca City.

44
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:45,641
Every platform down there
will be swarming with troopers.

45
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,885
Not this one. Trust me.

46
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,067
I'm only seeing three cruisers.

47
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,783
Where's the rest of the fleet?

48
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:01,203
Who cares? That's a good thing.

49
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,032
Locking onto the coordinates.

50
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,998
[ship approaches]

51
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,876
Hang on. This is going to get bumpy.

52
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,726
We are at the given coordinates, Omega.
There is nothing here.

53
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,105
You have to get lower.

54
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,900
Lower.

55
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,785
If I go any lower,
we will be in the water.

56
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,459
It's the only way
to activate the platform.

57
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:52,208
Hold on. Scanners are picking up
a large structure directly beneath us.

58
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,899
[Wrecker chuckles]
Never doubted you for a second, kid.

59
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,407
Landing was only one problem.
How are we going to get into the city?

60
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,991
We'll take the tube system.

61
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,117
[Echo] The what?

62
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,380
[beeping]

63
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,260
Come on.

64
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,388
[chuckles] Nice.

65
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:28,175
This type of underwater transport system
is not documented on any schematics.

66
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,603
Kaminoans keep a lot of secrets.

67
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,062
Indeed.

68
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,522
Omega, how did you know this existed?

69
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,402
Nala Se.

70
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,569
This tunnel leads
to her private research lab.

71
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,399
The others run throughout Kamino.

72
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,202
You, uh, all right?

73
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,775
It doesn't matter.
Saving Hunter is what matters.

74
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,125
Where are all the regs?

75
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,885
When did you start caring about them?

76
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,597
No Kaminoans either.

77
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,346
This facility's being decommissioned.

78
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,102
You don't seem too concerned.

79
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:18,899
Why would I be?

80
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,029
Because the Empire will be
phasing out clones next.

81
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,398
Not the ones that matter.

82
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:43,086
A ship was detected entering the system,
but we lost them below scanner range.

83
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,671
[Crosshair] It's them.

84
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,878
[ES-02] I'll notify the scouts.

85
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,096
Don't bother. They'll come to us.

86
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:54,598
They don't leave their own behind,
most of the time.

87
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,270
You tried to kill us.

88
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,019
We didn't have a choice.

89
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,765
Hmm.

90
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,066
And I did?

91
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,796
[Wrecker] That looks like every other
Kaminoan lab to me.

92
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,969
Not exactly.

93
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,219
Most in Tipoca City don't know about it.

94
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,971
[Tech] Hunter's comm is still active.
I'll pinpoint his location.

95
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,965
[Echo] I'll tap into the system.

96
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,057
I don't get it.

97
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,811
What's so special about this lab?

98
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,863
It's where I was created.

99
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,106
Here?

100
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,740
You all were here too.

101
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,567
[Tech] What do you mean?

102
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,657
Your mutations were enhanced in this room.

103
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,042
Experimental Unit 99 began right here.

104
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,501
I was there.

105
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:00,289
Wha-- [stammers]

106
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,373
Is that true?

107
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,750
How could I possibly know that?

108
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,665
It was only for a short time,

109
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,554
before you were sent
to be with the other clones.

110
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,335
[Echo] Something's not right.

111
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:16,137
All the central files have been wiped.
There's nothing in the system.

112
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,852
-Anyone else think that's weird?
-[metal squeaks]

113
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,821
Do not shoot! I am AZI-345211--

114
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:26,899
AZI?

115
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,607
Omega, I am relieved it is you.

116
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:31,863
What are you doing down here?

117
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,156
I am in hiding.

118
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,779
Soldiers were deactivating droids

119
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:38,496
and forcing key Kaminoan
medical personnel onto transports.

120
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,498
Those who resisted were eliminated.

121
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,540
[Echo] The clones did that?

122
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,214
No, these were other soldiers.

123
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:48,303
All clone troopers were reassigned
and transferred off-world,

124
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,470
with the exception of CT-9904.

125
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,629
Crosshair's here?

126
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,427
[groans] Should've known.

127
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,811
It is not safe here, Omega.

128
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:57,928
You must leave.

129
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,604
We can't. Not without Hunter.

130
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:04,024
Found him. His comm is pinging
from the central cloning platform.

131
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,194
Come on, AZI. You're with us.

132
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:19,042
[sighs] Crosshair,
I've seen what the Empire's doing,

133
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,668
occupying planets and silencing
anyone who stands against them.

134
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,378
You know it's not right.

135
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,709
You still don't see the bigger picture,

136
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:32,085
but you will.

137
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,013
[sighs] Can't you see they're using you?

138
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,636
It's that inhibitor chip in your head.

139
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,559
-It's making you follow--
-[alarm blaring]

140
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:44,061
We have an unauthorized entry
on platform 5.

141
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,058
Right on schedule.

142
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,938
[sighs] Time to go.

143
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,780
[alarm blaring continues]

144
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,820
AZI,
you said all the clone troopers were gone.

145
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,650
Correct. Those are not clone troopers.

146
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:38,236
They're TK troopers, like on Daro.

147
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,460
[device beeping]

148
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,958
Wait. Hunter's on the move. This way.

149
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:05,137
[beeping continues]

150
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:08,937
According to the comm signal,
Hunter is directly above us.

151
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,361
[Echo] The training room?
That's open ground.

152
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,780
If Crosshair's waiting, he'll pick us off.

153
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,359
Oh, he's waiting.

154
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,704
Precisely why we will not be going in
through the main entrance,

155
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,031
like he would expect.

156
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,078
We'll enter through the lift.

157
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,579
That should give us a slight advantage.

158
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,792
Omega, wait here.

159
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,961
No, we should stick together.

160
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,750
[Wrecker] No, Echo's right.

161
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,884
Crosshair's after us, not you.

162
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,881
[Echo] Stay out of sight.

163
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,593
If things go south,
we'll send you a signal.

164
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,184
Get back to the ship and contact Rex.

165
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,191
Well, guess you were wrong about that.

166
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,072
And here we all are, together again.

167
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,783
You won't be needing your weapons.

168
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,655
See?

169
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,040
Following orders isn't so difficult.

170
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,049
Where's your little sidekick?

171
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,426
You think we'd bring her here? [chuckles]

172
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,930
We're smarter than that.

173
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,137
Lying was never your strength, Wrecker.

174
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,682
Find the kid.

175
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,266
-[device beeps]
-It's the signal.

176
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:39,277
Per CT-1409's instructions,
we should flee to the research lab.

177
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:42,861
No. Something went wrong.
We have to help them.

178
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,161
But that means we will also be in danger.

179
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,662
Focus, AZI.

180
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,876
I have an idea.

181
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,313
We're running out of time, Commander.

182
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,680
Hold your positions.

183
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,807
So this was your grand plan?

184
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,854
Bring us here and kill us?

185
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:18,688
If I wanted you dead, you would be.

186
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:21,435
Not that it wouldn't be justified.

187
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,823
You betrayed everything we stood for.

188
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,907
And for what? The Republic?

189
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:33,714
We're loyal to each other,
not some Empire.

190
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,500
You weren't loyal to me.

191
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,673
I was one of you.

192
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:44,465
You may have forgotten, but I haven't.

193
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:49,561
And it's why I'm going to give you
what you never gave me:

194
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,175
a chance.

195
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,993
[Omega] I think I've almost got it.

196
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:10,906
-[ES-02] Freeze.
-[gasps]

197
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,790
Uh, hello.

198
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Sir, I've found the girl.

199
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,921
Send her on a shuttle off-world.

200
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,553
Crosshair, don't.

201
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,299
It's for her own good. And yours.

202
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,183
Omega belongs with us.

203
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,681
Living among fugitives
where she's in constant danger?

204
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:37,096
[scoffs] You want to protect the kid,
then let her go.

205
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,897
Stop pretending to be
something you're not, Hunter.

206
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:43,611
We're not like the regs.

207
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,113
We never have been.

208
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:47,697
We're superior.

209
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,198
The Empire can't protect the galaxy
without strength.

210
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,794
This is what we were made for.

211
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,713
Think of all we could do

212
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:00,747
together.

213
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,205
We were brothers once.

214
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:07,925
We can be again.

215
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:18,314
Why would we trust you?

216
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:23,784
Stand down.

217
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,820
[ES-03] Negative, Commander.

218
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,671
Does that answer your question?

219
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,473
[static on comm]

220
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,929
I said move it.

221
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:53,219
[chuckles, stammers]
I'm kinda in the middle of something.

222
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,767
[grunts]

223
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,190
I did it.

224
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:04,482
Nice work, AZI.

225
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:05,686
Now let's hurry.

226
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,781
You all are meant for more
than drifting through the galaxy.

227
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,199
It's time to stop running.

228
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:19,535
Join the Empire,
and you will have purpose again.

229
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,999
You really don't get who we are, do you?

230
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,050
Don't make the same mistake twice.

231
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:33,182
Don't become my enemy.

232
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:38,307
Crosshair, we never were.

233
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:43,648
[alarms blaring]

234
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:46,775
[Hunter grunts]

235
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,655
Hey, why did you activate the droids?

236
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:56,161
This was not my doing.

237
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,246
I believe you may have activated
a few too many droids.

238
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,835
I can see that, AZI.

239
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,316
[grunts]

240
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,507
Admiral, the commander lost control
of the situation.

241
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,718
[Rampart on comm]
Pull all remaining forces out.

242
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,049
Let the clones die together.

243
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:00,681
[grunts]

244
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:32,052
All essential personnel have been
removed from Kamino.

245
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,670
[Tarkin] And the chief scientist?

246
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:34,757
Secured.

247
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,261
The cloning technology is now
firmly under Imperial control.

248
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:40,677
Very good, Admiral.

249
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:42,644
You may fire when ready.

250
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,056
Move into position.

251
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,281
Crosshair, forget the Empire.

252
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,743
This isn't you.

253
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,831
It's your inhibitor chip.

254
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,081
We can help you.

255
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,495
Wrong.

256
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:52,383
I had my chip removed a long time ago.

257
00:20:56,464 --> 00:20:57,764
Since when?

258
00:20:58,425 --> 00:20:59,625
Does it matter?

259
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,758
Yes.

260
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:04,932
This is who I am.

261
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:21,947
Sorry, Omega.

262
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,535
I know I promised you'd never have
to come back here.

263
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,827
You did the same for me.

264
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:44,175
Hunter, three Venators are descending
on the city. We need to leave, now.

265
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:48,887
[grunts]

266
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,805
Wrecker, grab Crosshair.

267
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:52,646
He's coming with us.

268
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,256
Sir, we're in position.

269
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,385
Open fire.

270
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,642
[weapons powering up]

271
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,311
[explosions]

272
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,860
Hurry! Get to the lift!

273
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,572
[weapons firing]

274
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,704
Back inside! Go!
