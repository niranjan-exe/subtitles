Ah, Cham Syndulla, the

Attempting to assassinate
your own senator?

How unfortunate for your
people to see you fall.

They won't believe your lies.

6

Taa said you'd be a challenge,
but he was mistaken.

7

Your loyal followers will
be even easier to deal with.

Surely you know how dangerous
it can be out there.

You don't know Hera.

Eleni, you're the
reasonable one.

12

Tell us where she is and I will
ensure she is returned to you safely.

I have seen how you treat

Sir, the people

They're supporting a menace.

Syndulla's forces attacked our
transport and shot Senator Taa.

Yes, sir. I'll locate

That's not necessary. Another

00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,028
Why would he listen to me?

160
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,026
Because it's strategic.

161
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,040
Ryloth is your home. You
know it better than us.

162
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,540
Yes, I do.

163
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:51,133
[Chopper chatters]

164
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,681
So this is the
side you've chosen?

165
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,394
[sighs] Look.

166
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:09,555
You both attacked an Imperial convoy.
What did you think would happen?

167
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:13,146
Taa gave us no choice.
We had to protect Hera.

168
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,704
That's what I'm trying to do.

169
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,784
Admiral Rampart's squad is
out there looking for her.

170
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:23,907
She's in danger.

171
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,790
So please, if you know
where she is, tell me.

172
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,084
I'll protect her.

173
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,748
Like how you swore
to protect Ryloth?

174
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,377
We trusted you, Howzer.

175
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,258
I won't make that mistake again.

176
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,648
Attack the Capitol?
Wh... That was my plan.

177
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:57,822
Not the Capitol, the Imperial
refinery on the outskirts.

178
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,862
[Hera] I've been spying
on their activity.

179
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,356
I know their routine.

180
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:05,118
If we attack there, reinforcements
will be diverted from the Capitol.

181
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,121
We can use that distraction
to rescue Hera's parents.

182
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,123
Any heavy defenses
at the refinery?

183
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,337
Five perimeter cannons,
but they are unmanned.

184
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,419
Auto cannons are
extremely vulnerable.

185
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,295
Where is the control console?

186
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,800
[Hera] Right inside
the main gate.

187
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,005
It is heavily guarded,

188
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:27,314
but Chopper can slip inside with the
other droids and disable the cannons.

189
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:35,517
All right. You two go with Chopper
as backup, but at a distance.

190
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:36,477
- Really?
- Really?

By themselves?

193
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,200
Tech, Wrecker. Wait until those
cannons are down and move in.

194
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:47,742
Echo and I will scale the Capitol
wall and free Hera's parents.

195
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,408
I guess we'll follow your lead.

We have to help Chopper.

We will, but first, we need
to take the console off-line.

Uh, how are we going to do that?

Yeah.

deactivated the perimeter cannons?

No, but Hera and I are working on it.
Just don't shoot down our shuttle.

00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,954
[Tech] Wait. What shuttle?

They are mercenaries. But I
didn't hire them for this.

00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,015
Hera did.

Hera? Where is she? Is she safe?

to protect the refinery.

they attacking it?

You're walking into a trap.

276
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,465
There's a squad
out there waiting.

277
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,976
Why should we trust you?

278
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,692
Because I'm on your side.

279
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:54,362
What the Empire
is doing is wrong.

280
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,615
You have to get out of here.
They have the exits blocked.

281
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:02,158
We can use Senator Taa's shuttle
in his private tower hangar.

282
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:05,623
I'm sorry, General. I
should've stopped this sooner.

283
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,035
Our fight for
Ryloth is not over.

284
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,875
We will return.

285
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:13,248
You can't stay here.
They'll know you helped us.

286
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,508
I will not abandon my squad.

They're good men.

288
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,512
I have to try to
get through to them.

289
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,644
Go, while there's still time.

290
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,331
[Hunter] Tech, Omega, we
have alternate transport.

291
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,659
Meet at the rendezvous.

292
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,753
Gladly. Because there are
multiple Imperial vessels inbound.

293
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,377
[ES-04] Commander,
should we move in?

294
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,262
[Crosshair] Stay in position.

295
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,835
This is their way out.

296
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:15,817
Brothers. What are we doing?

297
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,700
We came here to free Ryloth from
Separatist control, and we succeeded.

298
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,280
But look around you.

299
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:28,196
We're now being ordered to target
the very people we swore to protect.

300
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,248
And I will not be a
part of it any longer.

301
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,455
Who will stand with me?

302
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,390
Arrest those traitors.

303
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:40,743
Here's the payment
Hera promised.

304
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,994
Keep it. You'll need it.

305
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:47,372
These occupations are happening
on other planets besides Ryloth.

306
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:53,120
I hoped to have fought my last war, but
our people need us now more than ever.

307
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,576
We must organize.

308
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,786
Well, that's not something
we can help with, General.

309
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,167
I have my own people
to look out for.

310
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,755
[device beeps]

311
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,300
If a war is coming, it will be
their fight as much as ours.

312
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:08,635
Come along, Hera.

313
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,266
Tech showed me how to
scramble a ship's signature.

314
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:17,112
We will soon see
how well it works.

315
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:19,608
It is time for us to go.

316
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,204
Well, copilot, we
didn't do too bad.

317
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,199
Do you have to go?

318
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:32,906
For now, but I'm sure
I'll see you around.

319
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,827
And keep an eye
on your brothers.

320
