[chattering]

3
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,641
- The Empire is not your enemy.
- [crowd jeering]

4
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:07,234
We promise to treat all planets within the
Confederacy of Independent Systems fairly.

5
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:11,197
All we asked in exchange
was for your loyalty.

6
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:14,736
Yet that has not been
forthcoming here on Raxus.

7
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,454
I can't go through with this.

8
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,945
[droid] Senator, it
is your only option.

9
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:24,415
This is what it's come to? I
must be a puppet for the Empire?

10
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,131
[droid] If you do not comply,

11
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,671
you will be arrested like
the other senators. Or worse.

12
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,555
[captain] To deal with
the rise in incursions,

13
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:35,352
a mandatory curfew will be put
into effect for your protection.

14
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,810
Such measures were approved by
your esteemed senator, Avi Singh,

15
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:46,112
who would like to say a few words
about the importance of cooperation

16
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,399
as we build a unified galaxy.

17
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,194
[jeering continues]

18
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,277
Senator?

19
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:57,242
GS-8, if anything happens to me,
follow my instructions to the letter.

20
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,535
What will happen,
Senator? Senator?

21
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,576
[crowd cheering, applauding]

22
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:14,835
[Singh] Fellow citizens, I implore
you to embrace these new laws.

23
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:18,716
Under the Empire, Raxus
will flourish once more.

24
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,774
And as your senator,
I promise...

25
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,437
I…

26
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,099
I promise to…

27
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,315
No.

28
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,236
This is wrong.

29
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,950
It is my duty to act
in your best interest,

30
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:45,254
and it is why I can no longer
condone this unjust occupation.

31
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,001
[cheering]

32
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,254
They wish to intimidate
us, to scare us,

33
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:56,378
but we shall not cower at
their acts of aggression.

34
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,258
[crowd booing]

35
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,933
- [comm beeps]
- Move in.

36
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,272
[clone trooper] Step
aside. Clear out!

37
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,351
We have every right to be here.

38
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,146
You're the ones trespassing.

39
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,324

[blaring continues]

42
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:49,017
I'm sending this message on behalf of
my master, Senator Avi Singh of Raxus.

43
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:53,401
The senator has been seized by Imperial
authorities and is in grave danger.

44
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,650
We require your assistance.

45
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,545
How's the Mantell Mix, kid?

46
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,088
[Omega] Mm-hmm.

47
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,882
Better than ever.

48
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,676
Yeah, it is. [Laughs]

49
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,636
So, when's our next mission?

50
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,389
With two bounty hunters after you,
it'd be wise to keep a low profile.

51
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,686
Tech's right.

52
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,146
There's too much
heat on us right now.

53
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,031
Ha! That never
stopped us before.

54
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,699
The kid's been through
enough. She needs a break.

55
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:41,905
[Echo sniffs]

56
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,485
She seems fine to me.

57
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,036
[music playing in Cid's
parlor, indistinct]

58
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,625
I've got a mission for you boys.

59
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:02,434
- A simple extraction on Raxus.
- Raxus?

60
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,430
That is the former center of
the Separatist government.

61
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,158
It has since become
an Imperial outpost...

62
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,602
I'm not interested in a
history lesson, Goggles.

63
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:16,265
You're being hired to locate and free
Senator Avi Singh from his confinement.

64
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,818
My client will meet you at the
given coordinates to brief you.

65
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,453
Details are on
this. Now get going.

66
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:25,075
Help a Separatist?

67
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,079
Not gonna happen.

68
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,834
Your debt's still
not paid, remember?

69
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,286
A job's a job.

70
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,180
I am not bringing Omega to a
planet swarming with Imperials.

71
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:47,927
So leave her here with me.
I'll keep an eye on her.

72
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,062
I don't exactly
trust you either.

73
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,522
Good. You shouldn't.

74
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,653
But if keeping the kid safe
means more money in my pocket,

75
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,692
it's in my best interest
to do so, isn't it?

76
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:04,493
- If anything happens to her...
- [Cid] Yeah, yeah, Bandana.

77
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,832
Just get outta here, will you?

78
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,674
Ready when you are, Sergeant.

79
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,378
Not this time, Omega.
You're staying with Cid.

80
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,550
But th-the mission. I'm
part of the squad too.

81
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,931
Then following orders
shouldn't be a problem.

82
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,467
Stay close to Cid and
don't leave this parlor.

83
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,312
Got it, soldier?

84
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,430
[groans]

85
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,267
Yes, sir.

86
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,895
Hey, tiny, I got
a mission for you.

87
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,864
Now get scrubbing.

88
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,249
We've never been
to Raxus before.

89
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,131
The coordinates from
Cid have us landing

90
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,798
outside the capital city of
Raxulon, the home of their Senate.

91
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,799
I can't believe we're
helping a Separatist senator.

92
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,219
So you have said. Repeatedly.

93
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,259
I always thought we'd
make it to Raxus someday.

94
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,144
But not like this.

95
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,822
[rapid beeping]

96
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:30,706
[trooper on comms] Unidentified
transport, this is restricted airspace.

97
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,162
Transmit your clearance code.

98
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,163
Input the codes
from Cid's client.

99
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,964
[rapid beeping]

100
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,091
Hunter, the client
is a Separatist.

101
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,419
How do we know
this isn't a trap?

102
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,554
[console beeps]

103
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,714
[trooper on comms] You're
cleared for entry. Proceed.

104
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,721
Now are you convinced?

105
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,598
No.

106
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,212
[Tech] I am simply stating that
the codes did, in fact, work.

107
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,503
The client being a
Separatist is not relevant.

108
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,625
[Echo] It is to me.

109
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,552
[Hunter] Forget politics.
We're here to do a job.

110
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,721
[GS-8] I am very pleased
to hear you say that.

111
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,054
[Tech] Who are you?

112
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,386
I am your client.

113
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,220
[Wrecker] We're
working for a droid?

114
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,595
That is correct.

115
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,442
My master, Senator Singh,
was arrested for speaking out

116
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,398
- against the unjust occupation...
- [Echo] We don't care.

117
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,069
[Hunter] Just take us to where
the senator's being held.

118
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,609
Right to it. I like you.

119
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,033
Very well. Follow me.

120
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:53,989
[Echo groans]

[tall alien laughs]

124
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,378
Enough with the moping around.

125
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,724
You're bringing the
mood down around here.

126
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,140
Sorry.

127
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,846
All right, I'll bite.
What's wrong with you?

128
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:21,313
I haven't heard back from them
yet. Do you think they're okay?

129
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,024
They better be for
what this job's paying.

130
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,276
I should've gone with
them on the mission.

131
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,529
It's not fair.

132
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,820
I've got news for you,
kid. Life ain't fair.

133
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,026
You don't like it?

134
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,695
Stop pouting and do
something about it.

135
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,696
Maybe if you
weren't so helpless,

136
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:43,628
those four laser brains wouldn't
have left you here with me.

137
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,996
[dejarik figures
whistling, squawking]

138
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,467
What are you two looking at?

139
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,143
I'm not helpless.

140
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:09,442
Look, kid, I told dark and broody I'd
keep an eye on you and keep you safe.

141
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,606
Hmm. For how much?

142
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,409
[scoffs] Not enough.

143
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,247
[birds squawk]

144
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,840
[camera beeping]

145
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,015
[GS-8] We have reached
our destination.

146
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:45,854
[Tech] There are six exterior guards
and multiple heat signatures inside.

147
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,188
Four in the subterranean level.

148
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:51,113
[Echo] Why do I get the
feeling you're setting us up?

149
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,402
It is against my programming
to send my allies into danger.

150
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,237
- [Wrecker] We ain't allies, tin bin.
- [Hunter] Enough.

151
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,291
We need to take out the
compound's surveillance system.

152
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:01,785
Move in.

153
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,631
[camera beeping]

154

[clone trooper groans]

155
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,435
[Hunter] Time to
make yourself useful.

156
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,480
[GS-8] I do not possess a military
skill set for a tactical advantage.

157
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,145
[Hunter] We're counting on it.

158
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,069
[clone trooper] You! This
is a restricted area!

159
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,074
To whom are you addressing?

160
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,156
This is my master's residence.

161
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,541
I suggest you leave before...

162
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,659
Oh, dear.

163
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,245
[clone trooper] Stop! Stop!

164
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,504
- [blows landing]
- [clone troopers groan]

165
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,996
[camera beeping]

166
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,463
[beeping continues on datapad]

167
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:35,628
[Tech] I am tapped into
their security system.

168
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,804
[Hunter] You two,
clear the upper levels.

169
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:40,682
Tech, we'll take the
main floor and below.

170
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,550
Droid, you're sticking with me.

171
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,348
[clone trooper groans]

172
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,986
[Hunter] There's
two at the door.

173
00:12:58,069 --> 00:13:00,489
[Tech] I'm clocking four
in the adjacent corridor.

174
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,832
[Hunter] I'll handle them. You
and Omega loop back around.

175
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:09,464
[Tech] That would be impossible,
seeing as Omega is not on this mission.

176
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,168
- [Hunter] Ah, right.
- [GS-8] Not to worry.

177
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,270
- I am getting the hang of this.
- [Hunter] No, wait!

178
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,464
Excuse me, guards.
I appear to be lost.

179
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,917
Can you direct me to
the nearest egress?

180
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,057
[stun grenade humming]

181
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,227
[Hunter shouts]

182
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,316
[clone trooper sighs]

183
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,323
[GS-8] Do be careful.

184
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:45,084
This antique vase was gifted to
Senator Singh for his years of service.

185
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,158
It is priceless.

186
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,702
[Hunter] Droids.

187
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,292
[up-tempo music playing]

188
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:58,337
[tall alien laughs]
You've got her cornered!

189
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,971
Oh, yeah, I'm real scared.

190
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,139
Delay all you want, you're
not getting out of this one.

191
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,474
[Omega] I wouldn't do that.

192
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:12,104
Hear that? We got
an expert here.

193
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,612
[dejarik figure whistles]

194
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:21,527
- [dejarik figures roar, shriek]
- [tall alien laughs] She's done for!

195
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,357
I told you.

196
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,578
Well, expert, what
should I do next?

197
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,748
- [dejarik figure whimpers]
- [tall alien groans] You blew it!

198
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:40,007
[dejarik figure shrieks]

199
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,684
Yeah, but you're the one
who said to bet it all!

200
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,838
[tall alien] You wanna
take this outside?

201
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,097
Gladly!

202
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,805
How'd you know to do that?

203
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:54,271
It's a strategy game.
I'm good at strategy.

204
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,521
Hmm.

205
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,064
How good?

206
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:02,568
Enough to, uh, win a few
matches for some money?

207
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,492
Depends.

208
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,199
What's my cut?

209
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,327
Hmm.

210
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,450
Thirty percent.

211
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,121
Sixty.

212
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,425
[interrogation droid humming]

213
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:33,217
[captain] Defying Imperial law
and openly inciting civil discord.

214
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:36,098
I thought we had an
understanding, Senator.

215
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,364
I refuse to be your puppet.

216
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,355
My loyalty is to the
people, not the Empire.

217
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,861
An unwise choice.

218
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,949
Regardless, we will acquire
what we need from you.

219
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,281
Your draconian tactics won't
work on me, Captain Bragg.

220
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,701
That would be a first.

221
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,633
[rapid humming]

222
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,844
- [blaster firing]
- [Bragg shouts]

223
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:08,465
[device beeps]

224
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,886
[GS-8] Senator!

225
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,653
I followed your
instructions to the letter.

226
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,769
I knew you'd come through, GS-8.

227
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:23,484
And behold. I have saved
your most prized vase.

228
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,896
[Hunter] Great. Now
can we get out of here?

229
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,566
With pleasure.

230
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,124
- [datapad beeps]
- [Tech] An alert has been triggered.

231
00:16:32,409 --> 00:16:33,909
[alarm blares]

232
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,794
- Our position has been compromised.
- [Hunter] Follow us.

233
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,247
[alarm blaring]

234
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,716
[clone trooper] Come on!

235
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,142
[Hunter] There.

236
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,350
We'll seize that tank and
blow our way outta here.

237
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,452
[GS-8] How do you intend to gain control
of the armored vehicle from up here?

238
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,766
[Wrecker] Coming through.

239
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,614
[clone trooper groans]

240
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,526
[clone trooper shouts, groans]

241
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,119
[Tech] All clear.

242
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:18,874
[GS-8] Impressive.

243
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,462
You can't possibly
expect me to do that.

244
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,542
[Wrecker sighs]

245
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,210
- Just don't look down.
- [Singh] Oh!

246
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:31,127
[Singh grunts, pants]

247
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,677
[GS-8] Nicely done.

248
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,641
[Hunter] Get this
thing moving, Tech.

249
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,148
[Wrecker] They'll feel
that in the morning.

250
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,265
- [comm beeps]
- They've commandeered one of the walkers.

251
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,449
Pin them down.

252
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,966
[Tech] The rear axle
stabilizer is off-line.

253
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,262
We will need to
recalibrate manually.

254
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:19,966
[Hunter] Get this bucket up and running.
Wrecker and I will hold them off.

255
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,156
[clone troopers groan]

256
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,997
[Wrecker] No, you don't!

257
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,931
- [blaster fires]
- [clone trooper shouts]

258
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:51,094
- [Hunter] Wrecker.
- [Wrecker laughing] Oh!

259
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,514
Oh, yeah!

260
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,514
[shell whistles]

261
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,746
[Hunter grunts]
Tech, how we doing?

262
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,248
[Tech] I need more time.

263
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:24,747
[clone trooper] Freeze.

264
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:26,617
Drop your weapons.

265
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,337
You there.

266
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,671
[GS-8] Senator!

267
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,965
I never much cared
for that vase.

268
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:41,262
- Repairs complete.
- [Hunter] We're on our way.

269
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:55,899
Turn down that alleyway.

270
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,993
[Tech] We'll be trapped
in a choke point.

271
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,451
You're going to
have to trust me.

272
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,658
[oil splashing]

273
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,875
[clone trooper] They're
moving into a dead end.

274
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:23,888
Move into position next to that wall.
It leads to a subterranean passage.

275
00:20:32,107 --> 00:20:35,357
If you don't mind, please blast
a hole in the wall right here.

276
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:36,863
[Wrecker] That I can do.

277
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:41,834
[explosion]

278
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,502
[rodents screech]

279
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,166
Hurry. This way.

280
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,900
Captain, the walker's empty.

281
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,326
What am I doing?

282
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,329
I cannot abandon my people.

283
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:33,587
I must help them.

284
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:37,128
[GS-8] You will, Senator, but not
if you are in Imperial custody.

285
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:45,385
[Echo] She's right. Live
to fight another day.

286
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:25,136
- [whistling, cheering in distance]
- What's all this?

287
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,016
- No one can stop this kid.
- [people cheering]

288
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,693
Of course.

289
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,570
[onlookers gasp, murmur]

290
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,879
[onlookers gasp]

291
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:01,133
[cheering]

292
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,764
[man] Oh, she did it again!

293
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,219
[onlookers applaud]

294
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,518
All right, show's
over. No more bets.

295
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:18,403
Kid, where'd you
learn to do that?

296
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,318
She's a natural. I've never
seen anything like it.

297
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:28,493
I told you to keep a low
profile. This is the opposite.

298
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,538
Ease up, Bandana.

299
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:36,370
Omega made enough money to pay
off the debt you boys owe me,

300
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,838
so try showing a little
gratitude to my friend.

301
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:41,764
You did good.

302
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,966
Senator, glad you made it.

303
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,218
Let's talk payment.

304
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,729
You really paid off our debt?

305
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:03,489
I wanted to be useful, even if
I couldn't go on the mission.

306
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,742
[Hunter] Hmm.

307
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:10,368
How about we put those
strategy skills to the test?

308
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,241
One match.

309
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:16,497
If you win, then no more
sitting out on missions.

310
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,499
You ready for this?

311
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:25,005
Are you?
