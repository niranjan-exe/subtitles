00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:38,367
- [thunder rumbling]
- [wind howling]

2
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,931
From now on, I'm to be apprised of
all matters here, Prime Minister.

3
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:59,601
Scrappers on Bracca reported a
power surge on a Jedi cruiser.

4
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:01,104
Send a scout team.

5
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,056
We'll need more than that.

6
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,896
It's Clone Force 99.

7
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,032
Admiral Rampart,

8
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:12,989
the clones of experimental unit
99 are highly skilled assets.

9
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,203
It would be most beneficial
to have them returned alive.

10
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:19,584
I have no interest in a group
of rogue clone deserters.

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,000
If you find them on
Bracca, terminate them.

12
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,335
[birds chittering]

13
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,970
And that's how you disassemble
a thermal explosive.

14
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:41,176
There's tons of live ordnance
buried in this shipyard.

15
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,517
If you trip one, you need
to know how to disable it.

16
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,895
Seems simple enough.

17
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:51,701
Well, if you're so
sure, here. Disarm it.

18
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,818
- Me? But I only watched you once...
- Ten seconds till we're both goners.

19
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:59,197
- Ten, nine…
- The conductor feeds the coil expander.

20
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,195
- …eight…
- This connects to the transmitter.

21
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,287
- …seven…
- Then what?

22
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,369
…six,

23
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,043
- five, four…
- [beeping]

24
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:13,878
- I don't know which wire to cut next.
- Better get it right. Three, two, one!

25
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,967
- [beeping speeds up]
- Obviously not that one.

26
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,302
Too late! Run for it!

27
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,764
[grunts]

28
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,807
[explosion]

29
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,518
[laughs] Gotcha.

30
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,776
- [scoffs] Why didn't it explode?
- Ha!

31
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,279
Because it's a smoke bomb.

32
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,321
You think I'd let you train
with a live explosive?

33
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,326
I'm not crazy. [Laughs]

34
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,199
You should've seen your face.

35
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,576
Wrecker, Omega, pack it in. Hunter
wants us back at the Jedi cruiser.

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,210
How'd the test go?

37
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,625
I don't wanna talk about it.

38
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,263
Cheer up, kid.

39
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,178
I failed my first
disarming test too.

40
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,429
With my help, you'll
be a pro in no time.

41
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,482
We've got eyes on us.

42
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,486
Yeah, I see 'em.

43
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,569
[whispering] How many?

44
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,493
At least three. Stay casual.

45
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,084
Wrecker, you ready?

46
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:23,036
Waiting on you.

47
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,119
[grunts]

48
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,083
[Wrecker] Stop!

49
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,206
[scrapper groans]

50
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,924
[Wrecker] Oh, no you don't.

51
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,047
- Whoa! I've got this under control.
- [Echo] Hunter, Tech.

52
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,763
We were spotted by scrappers.

53
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,393
[Omega] Wrecker's in pursuit.
He says he has it under control.

54
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,851
That's not comforting.

55
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,561
- Echo, get a visual.
- I'm on it.

56
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,135
[screams]

57
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,267

- [beeps]
- [machine whirs]

59
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,194
[grunts]

60
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,741
Whoa! [Grunts]

61
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,745
[pants] Are you okay?

62
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:11,711
I... I was just waiting
to make my move.

63
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,801
Rex warned us about the
scrapper patrols on Bracca.

64
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:20,974
We should leave.

65
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,892
In our present
situation, we need money.

66
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,642
And we have a chance to
make a lot of it right here.

67
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:29,475
[Wrecker] Ha! In this dump? How?

68
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:33,021
Tech, what's the potential
haul inside this cruiser?

69
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,226
My scans indicate

70
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,395
the armory and artillery bay
have not been fully off-loaded.

71
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,565
The dianoga must have
kept the scrappers away.

72
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:44,155
Just a few of those weapons
should clear our debt with Cid.

73
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,492
We're soldiers,
not arms smugglers.

74
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:50,214
There's no Republic for
us to rely on anymore.

75
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,210
We're presented with an opportunity
here. We have to take it.

76
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,764
I would also add that the intel
from the bridge's central system

77
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,589
has the potential to be worth
far more than any weapon.

78
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,505
[scoffs] Not to me.

79
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,104
[Hunter] Tech,
get to the bridge.

80
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,849
Get the power online and
whatever intel you can gather.

81
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,481
Uh, what do we do about them?

82
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,479
We'll grab what we need and be
gone before they even wake up.

83
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,609
- [banging]
- [door creaks]

86
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,684
Wrecker, you're gonna like this.

87
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,642
[gasps] Oh, yeah.

88
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,887
Wow.

89
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,145
You think that's
great, check this out.

90
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,856
- [comm beeps]
- [Tech] The power's back on.

91
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,528
Yeah, we can see that.

92
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,449
[grunts]

93
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,372
[buzzes]

94
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:20,264
Whoa! So many proton torpedoes.

95
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,799
Come here, beautiful.

96
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,842
[gasps] Can you show
me how to arm that?

97
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,507
- Sorry, kid. This one's all mine.
- [comm beeps]

98
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,426
[Tech] Omega, I need
you up on the bridge.

99
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,595
Copy that.

100
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:34,443
[laughs, kisses]

101
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:39,356
[Hunter] With a haul like this,
Cid will owe us for a change.

102
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,821
[Echo] If we'd left with Rex, we
wouldn't have to owe Cid at all.

103
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,105
[Hunter] He's on a
different path than us.

104
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:50,447
Hunter, we're soldiers.
What other path is there?

105
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,338
- [bangs]
- [grunts]

106
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,760
[electricity crackling]

107
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,175
- How's it looking?
- [Tech] We're in luck.

108
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,184
Whoever scuttled this ship didn't
wipe the hardware's data imprint.

109
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:17,936
I'm transferring the files, but I
still need to copy the master drive.

110
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,561
It's under that panel.

111
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,662
Tech… what was the war like?

112
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:37,124
It was a primary mission objective
comprised of battles on various fronts.

113
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,127
But what was it like?

114
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,289
Hmm? I just told you.

115
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,588
[console beeping]

116
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,222
Why is this button blinking?

117
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,471
That's the proximity sensor.

118
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,604
It signals when there's
an approaching vessel.

119
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,639
It's most likely
a short circuit.

120
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,229
- [comm beeps]
- Hunter, we've got company.

121
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,527
[Hunter] Is it more scrappers?

122
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,454
No, it's the Empire.

123
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,209
Prime Minister.

124
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,330
We can no longer delay.

125
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:26,298
The Empire's mission on Bracca poses
a threat to our contingency plan.

126
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:29,301
I will have to call
upon further assistance.

127
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,054
Is that wise?

128
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,468
We already have someone
handling matters.

129
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:38,846
As long as one of these bounty hunters
deliver the young clone intact,

130
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,145
that is all that
should concern us.

131
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,742
[Hunter sighs] It's
Crosshair, all right.

132
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,833
[Tech] He won't be able to detect
us. I'm blocking their scanners.

133
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,249
That won't stop him. Come on.

134
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,674
[ES-04] That cruiser's where
the power surge was detected.

135
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,295
[ES-02] Any life signs on board?

136
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,261
[ES-03] Can't tell. The
scanner's not working.

137
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,302
There's too much
atmospheric interference.

138
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:15,603
No, you're being jammed.

139
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,849
They're still on board.

140
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,273
Take a shuttle and
find their ship.

141
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,355
Yes, Commander.

142
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:39,199
[electricity crackles]

143
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,457
[Echo] How many troopers
we talking about?

144
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,869
Three attack shuttles' worth.

145
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,917
[Wrecker] We already got what we
came for. Let's get to the Marauder.

146
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,302
[Hunter] They're already on board the
cruiser. We need a covert way out.

147
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:53,301
[Echo] They'll do a forward-to-aft sweep.
We can alternate corridors. Come on.

148
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,930
- [comm beeps]
- [CT-8508] Commander.

149
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,175
What is it?

150
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,110
We found their ship.
There's no one inside.

151
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,648
- Secure the perimeter.
- Yes, sir.

152
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,410
[Hunter] Talk to me, Tech.

153
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,490
I'm trying to tap into the regs' comms
so we can monitor their movements.

154
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,735
[banging]

155
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,040
[Hunter] Someone's coming.

156
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,969
[comms chatter]

157
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:41,807
[device beeping]

158
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,314
[comms chatter]

159
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,404
[Tech] I'm in.

160
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,707
- [Crosshair] All squads.
- [trooper] Yes, sir.

161
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,861
[Crosshair] Push the
targets towards the hangar.

162
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:51,441
- We'll pin them down.
- Roger that.

163
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,646
- [device beeps]
- Aren't we headed to the hangar?

164
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,156
Not anymore. We'll cut
through the artillery deck.

165
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,870
[rumbling]

166
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,136
[Wrecker] Uh…

167
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,218
Okay, I'm not
going out that way.

168
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,548
[clone trooper] There they are.

169
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,903
[ES-04] Stand down.

170
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,359
[door opens]

171
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,819
[Crosshair] Tapping our
comms to track our movements?

172
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,485
So predictable.

173
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:41,533
[Wrecker scoffs] Nice to
see you too, Crosshair.

174
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,792
[Tech] Echo, scomp in and reroute
reserve power to the cannons.

175
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,962
[Echo] If these cannons fire,
this whole deck will collapse.

176
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,209
Exactly.

177
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,915
Look at you all,
scavenging like rats.

178
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,588
How pathetic.

179
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:00,177
Why come after us?

180
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,011
You're traitors.

181
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,474
[ES-04] Move into position.

182
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,150
- [Echo] Done.
- [beeping]

183
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,819
Crosshair, wake up.

184
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,986
You're being controlled
by an inhibitor chip.

185
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,899
He's telling the truth.

186
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:21,157
The Kaminoans put chips
in all the clones.

187
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,371
Remember what I told
you in the brig?

188
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,700
You can't help it.

189
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,711
Aim for the kid.

190
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,729
- Your issue's with me, not her.
- [Wrecker] Hurry up.

191
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:38,723
- [Echo] Systems online in three, two, one.
- I suggest you drop your weapon.

192
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,930
[groans]

193
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,560
[Hunter] Go!

194
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,562
[groans]

195
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,146
[clone trooper groans]

196
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:57,858
[Hunter] Look out!

197
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,068
[Wrecker shouting]

198
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,786
[clone trooper screams]

199
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,719
[Wrecker] Whoa!

200
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,626
- [Wrecker grunts]
- [ES-04 groans]

201
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:24,348
Direct hit. Yeah!

202
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,531
[Wrecker] The ion
engine chamber?

203
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,994
Why'd you bring us here?

204
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,958
[Tech] Because this is our
alternate egress off the cruiser.

205
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,129
[Wrecker groans] I don't
even know what that means.

206
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:55,666
Whoa. Uh-oh.

207
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,133
[Crosshair groans]

208
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,048
[coughs]

209
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,609
- [comm beeps]
- Status report?

210
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:21,295
[clone trooper] There's no sign of
them. They're avoiding the choke points.

211
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,989
Bring a shuttle to
the artillery deck.

212
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,326
[ES-04] They must
be heading aft.

213
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:31,370
Get to the bridge and
wait for my orders.

214
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,306
[Hunter] We're almost
there. A little further.

215
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,562
[groans]

216
00:14:57,397 --> 00:15:00,477
[Echo] I didn't think you meant
we'd be escaping through the engine.

217
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,897
I could not have been clearer.

218
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,355
[Wrecker stammers] Whoa!

219
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,575
Whoa, I've never been
inside an ion engine before.

220
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,617
It'd be weirder if you had.

221
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,457
[Tech] These chambers are
quite the engineering marvel.

222
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,304
This blast primer coating
is capable of withstand...

223
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,719
- [Wrecker] No one cares! Keep movin'.
- [Tech groans]

224
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:33,976
[Wrecker groaning]

225
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,305
Well? Now what?

226
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,691
[Tech] Whoa! Whoa.

227
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,909
Try again, Hunter.

228
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,778
I told you before,
you're surrounded.

229
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,203
[Hunter] Double back.

230
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,828
[rumbling]

231
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,877
[machine whirring]

232
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,550
What is that?

233
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,759
[Hunter] Sounds like the
engine's coming online.

234
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,009
But that's not possible, right?

235
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:08,592
- [Tech] Technically, it is.
- [beeps]

236
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:12,007
I restored the ship's main power core
when I accessed the central system,

237
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,307
which means the engines
can be activated.

238
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:20,654
Crosshair wouldn't
do that, would he?

239
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,780
[Echo] How much time do we have?

240
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,188
[Tech] I estimate
less than two minutes.

241
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,450
[controls beeping]

242
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,911
[rumbling]

243
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,035
What do we do?

244
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,205
[Wrecker] Uh, what about Plan 7?

245
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:47,378
[Echo] Plan 7 has nothing to do
with this situation whatsoever.

246
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,835
Well... Well you
think of something!

247
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:53,216
Can we use the explosives from
the armory to disable the engine?

248
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,684
[Tech] It won't cause a large enough
reaction to affect the thermal chamber.

249
00:16:56,766 --> 00:17:00,056
But if we place a series of
charges around this cone,

250
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:02,225
we may be able to break
away from the cylinder

251
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,863
while destabilizing the core.

252
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,534
Break away? You mean
fall? All the way down?

253
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,031
[Echo] It's that
or be incinerated.

254
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,554
[Hunter] Everyone
take an explosive.

255
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,615
Tech, Omega, up top with me.

256
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,459

[clone trooper] Sir,
the engines are ready.

261
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,597
Engage.

262
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,225
[controls beeping]

263
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,283

[Wrecker] Whoa!

266
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:00,616
[Tech] Hold on!

267
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,209
[Crosshair] No!

[sighs]

277
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,205
[Echo] Hunter, we
landed on the port side.

278
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,753
What's your status?

279
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:51,207
[Hunter] We're by the engine,
and we've got company.

280
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,184
Meet back at the Marauder.

281
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,685
Commander. Commander,
can you hear me?

282
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,396
- We need a medic!
- [Crosshair groans]

283
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,986
They're headed for
their ship. [Inhales]

284
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,202
Stop the [groans]

285
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:20,162
- [comm beeps] CT-8508, have
you secured the enemy ship?

286
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,156
CT-8508, do you copy?

287
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,167
CT-8508. Report!

288
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:35,876
What happened to them?

289
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,768
Someone's here. This wasn't
the scrappers' handiwork.

290
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,097
Wasn't much work.

291
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,902
Omega. Get behind me.

292
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:09,752
I've taken down so many
clones over the years.

293
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:13,174
Once you figure out
one, the rest are easy.

294
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,092
You're in for a surprise.

295
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,637
I doubt that.

296
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,428
He's a bounty hunter.

297
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,393
Ain't you smart?

298
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,517
The kid's got it
all figured out.

299
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,725
You're in trouble now.

300
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:30,562
Who hired you?

301
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,613
Son, that's confidential
information.

302
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,703
Now hand her over.

303
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:40,738
She's with us.

304
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,914
She's not going anywhere.

305
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,410
That's unfortunate…

306
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,788
For you.

307
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,196

00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,622

Hunter! [Sobs]

00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:29,328
Hunter?

311
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,625

[Wrecker] What
happened? Where's Omega?

321
00:22:22,092 --> 00:22:24,052
[Echo] He was shot
in the chest plate.

322
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:26,005
[Tech] We have to
get him on board.

323
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,263
Incoming!

324
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:30,388
[Echo] Got him. Tech,
fly us out of here!

325
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,975
[Wrecker] Go, go, go!

326
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,150
[Hunter breathing heavily]

327
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,699
He… He took Omega.

328
00:22:50,787 --> 00:22:52,407
Who? Crosshair?

329
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:55,207
No. A bounty hunter.

330
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,461
[groans]

331
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,377
We have to find her.
