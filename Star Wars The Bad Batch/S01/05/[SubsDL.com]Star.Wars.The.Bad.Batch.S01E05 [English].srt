1
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,618
[Tech] It's not an exact fit.

2
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,077
I get my own comm device?

3
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:46,758
Technically, it was Crosshair's,
but he doesn't appear to need it.

4
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,468
[echoes over comm] Echo,
what's your position? Over.

5
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,931
[clears throat] It's
not a toy, Omega.

6
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:54,925
Copy that.

7
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,523
Why are we going to Ord Mantell?
I thought the plan was to lay low.

8
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,862
Not while a bounty hunter's after
you. We need to find out why.

9
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:09,322
I know an informant there named
Cid who might be able to help.

10
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,361
And you trust him?

11
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,856
Well, the Jedi trusted him.

12
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,077
The Jedi who are all dead?

13
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,868
Well, anyone have
a better option?

14
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,035
[Omega on comm] He has a point.

15
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,035
Right. Not a toy.

16
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,817
[Hunter] Remember the rules?

17
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,280
Don't wander off, keep my eyes
and ears on my surroundings,

18
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,912
and trust no one but my squad.

19
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:57,948
- [Echo] And if you get into trouble?
- Use my comm and give my location.

20
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,792
[Echo] This is the place.

21
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:07,918
[Tech] Charming.

22
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,388
[big alien] Filthy
cheat! I saw that!

23
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,642
[small alien] Me? Who
are you calling a cheat?

24
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,438
Which one of them is Cid?

25
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,691
I couldn't tell ya.

26
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,652
I only heard about Cid.
Never actually met him.

27
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:33,454
That would have been
information to share earlier.

28
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,582
We're looking for
Cid. You know him?

29
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,158
[big alien] You
know what you did!

30
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,203
- Cid, huh?
- [small alien laughs]

31
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,367
You broke the machine again
with your stupid hands!

32
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,666
Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.

33
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,289
What about them?

34
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,415
[big alien] I'll break
you with my stupid hands.

35
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,842
Was I not clear? You're
in the wrong place.

36
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,843
So unless you're here to
spend money, get lost.

37
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,675
Great plan, Echo.

38
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:02,434
I'm certain this is Cid's.

39
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,265
The Jedi came here
during the war.

40
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,555
[Tech] Well, perhaps Cid heard
what happened to the Jedi and fled.

41
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,977
Or he was arrested for violating
countless health code regulations.

42
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,819
What's your deal, tiny?

43
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,236
You're Cid.

44
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,868
You're sharper than
your friends over there.

45
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,253
Did the Jedi have
any other informants?

46
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,581
Several, but Cid was the
only one I knew how to find.

47
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,628
So, we came all this
way for nothing?

48
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,052
[Omega on comm] I found Cid.

49
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,019
I had a good thing
going with the Jedi.

50
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,639
They valued my insights,

51
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:53,230
but now that they're all dead, the
demand for my services has declined.

52
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,736
Thanks to this new Empire.

53
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:58,449
Times have changed...
for all of us.

54
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,860
No kidding.

55
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,078
I never had clone deserters
come to me before.

56
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,459
Yes, well, we separated due to a
fundamental difference in ideology.

57
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,999
That's cute, you
thinking I care.

58
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,843
Cut to it and tell
me what you want.

59
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,301
By all means, make
yourself at home.

60
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,512
We encountered this
woman on Pantora.

61
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,561
Do you know who she is?

62
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,888
No, but I know a bounty
hunter when I see one.

63
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,305
Can you find out who hired her?

64
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,187
That depends on what
you boys do for me.

65
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,565
Are you fresh outta the tube?

66
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:45,826
You pull a job for me, and I
get the information you want.

67
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,830
That's how this
mercenary thing works.

68
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,212
Mercenary?

69
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,539
Not too quick, are ya?

70
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,214
Clearly, the kid's the
brains of your operation.

71
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,707
[sighs] What kind of job?

72
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,216
A rescue.

73
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,510
There's a nice bounty
on a kid named Muchi.

74
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:08,352
My sources say she was
taken by Zygerrian slavers

75
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:11,063
who are holed up on the
other side of the planet.

76
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,114
Bring me the kid and
I'll get you your intel.

77
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,649
Well, who collects the bounty?

78
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,532
Oh, look. It talks.

79
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:23,065
We split the bounty 70-30, my
favor. Take it or leave it.

80
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,406
Grab a kid from
a few Zygerrians?

81
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,042
[laughs] We could do
that in our sleep.

82
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,543
Looks like we have a deal.

83
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,831
Details of the
bounty are on that.

84
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:35,167
Don't screw it up.

85
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,715
[groans]

86
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,802
You all right?

87
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,392
Yeah, yeah. It's nothing.

88
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,772
According to Cid's intel,

89
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,360
the Zygerrian slave traders are hiding
in the ruins of Old Ord Mantell city.

90
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,652
What's a slave trader?

91
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:01,323
Someone who buys and
sells people for credits.

92
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:03,283
People can be sold?

93
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:08,158
They don't have a choice. They're
captives treated like property.

94
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,123
That... doesn't seem right.

95
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,214
It's not.

96
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,714
And we are going to stop it
from happening to that kid.

97
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:19,632
As well as earn a decent amount of
credits once the job is complete.

98
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,763
Yeah, that too.

99
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,506
Don't worry, Muchi.
We'll rescue you.

100
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,093
[Tech] I have a visual.

101
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,668
I only see one child.

102
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04,375
Poor Muchi. She looks scared.

103
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,676
[Tech] I'm clocking
two dozen hostiles.

104
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,720
Multiple entry points
with minor fortification.

105
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:13,024
[Wrecker] Simple smash and
grab like that time on Kuat.

106
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,349
Easy enough.

107
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,144
I'm in. What are we waiting for?

108
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,557
- [Hunter] You get back to the ship.
- But...

109
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,824
[Hunter] That's an order.

110
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,610
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,128
[Hunter] Echo, you're
the eyes in the sky.

112
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,886
Wrecker, draw the Zygerrian forces
out. Tech and I will grab the kid.

113
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,259
[Wrecker] Not a problem.

114
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:57,639
[brezak growls]

115
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,110
[Hunter] Echo, sitrep.

116
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,693
[Echo] Two roving
patrols on speeders.

117
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,735
First guard
checkpoint dead ahead.

118
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,069
[brezak growls]

119
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,238
Hang on. I think
I've got company.

120
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,285
[Hunter] Well, take
care of it. Quietly.

121
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:16,159
- [brezak shrieks]
- [Echo groans]

122
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,168
- [brezak shrieking]
- [Hunter] Watch out!

123
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,259
[hologram speaking Huttese]

124
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,425
A mission of this nature
requires planning.

125
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:39,385
Assure your employer, he'll
be reunited with Muchi soon.

126
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:42,267
[speaking Huttese]

127
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,895
Now, now. There's
no need for threats.

128
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,654
I have my best people on it.

129
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,871
- [servos whirring]
- [droid honking]

130
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,213
I'm making some
alterations to my trooper.

131
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,706
Now she's a Bad Batcher.

132
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,507
- What do you think?
- [droid honks]

133
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,681
[Zygerrian] We found their ship.

134
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,760
Gonky, hide.

135
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:16,425
[Gonky honking]

136
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:21,807
Check the hold.

137
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,685
Make sure no one's on board.

138
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,472
The ship is clear.
We're returning to base.

139
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,396
- Hunter, do you copy?
- [static on comm]

140
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,363
Tech? Echo? Wrecker?

141
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,284
Anyone?

142
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,342
[exhales]

143
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,167
It's getting looser.

144
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,762
[groans]

145
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,393
Do that one more
time and you'll be...

146
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,640
[groans]

147
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:42,523
Save your energy. We
are going to need it.

148
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,850
[brezak shrieks]

149
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,824
[brezak growls]

00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,406
[shrieks]

151
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,083
[child whimpering]

152
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,963
Relax, Muchi. We're the cavalry.

153
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,341
What are our odds
out of this, Tech?

154
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,588
I am not certain.

155
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,459
So much for being smart.

156
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:15,176
[sighs] This is not a
standard military operation,

157
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,048
and seeing as how
we've never been tasked

158
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,845
with rescuing a child
from slave traders before,

159
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,969
there is no data I
can compare it to.

160
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,677
We need to signal Omega
before their scouts find her.

00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:28,608
Except our comms are over
there with our weapons.

162
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,696
We won't need a

Four new slaves to
add to my collection.

Strong ones too.

167
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,680
You should fetch a nice price.

168
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,681
The Republic outlawed slavery.

We're not in the
Republic anymore, skug.

You're lucky we
don't have our gear

171
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,779
because this would go
very differently for you.

With the meddling Republic gone,

00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:07,447
we can return to Kadavo and
rebuild what was taken from us.
