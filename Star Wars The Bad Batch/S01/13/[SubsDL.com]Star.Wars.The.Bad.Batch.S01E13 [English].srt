1
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,810
Cid better pay us
extra for that mission.

2
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,563
[Wrecker] Eh. It wasn't so bad.

3
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:06,897
She failed to mention the drop zone
would be swarming with Gundarks.

4
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:10,243
It is not the first time she
has left out key details.

5
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,377
- [chattering]
- [electronic music playing loudly]

6
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:35,007
When did this place
get so popular?

7
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,755
And who are they?

8
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:39,056
Not our problem. Let's find Cid.

9
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,475
[masked guard] Where do
you think you're going?

10
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,068
[blows landing]

11
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,149
[grunts]

12
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,777
It's rude to barge into
one's office unannounced.

13
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,195
This isn't your office.

14
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,544
[scoffs] Guess again.

15
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,921
- Ruby?
- She's my prized pet.

16
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,628
What are you doing with her?

17
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,502
I paid. Cid delivered.

18
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,588
And where is Cid?

19
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,433
Cid's out.

20
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:17,598
This parlor and Ord Mantell
are now my territory.

21
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,675
But if you're looking for
work, I might have use for you.

22
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,516
We'll think about it.

23
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,860
You do that.

24
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,152
We're getting off Ord Mantell.

25
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,614
Tech, prep the ship. The rest
of us will gather supplies.

26
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,066
But what about Cid?

27
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,950
What did he mean when
he said she was "out"?

28
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,704
Given his tone,

29
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:44,995
it is a plausible assumption that Cid
was either forced out or taken out.

30
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,174
Well, we have to find
her and help her.

31
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,803
[Cid clears throat]

32
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,802
Nice to see one of you cares.

33
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,553
Inside. Now.

34
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,809
So you boys met Roland.

35
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,560
He's a former client and the
son of crime boss Isa Durand.

36
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:10,984
Roland's trying to make a name for
himself by joining up with the Pykes.

37
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,186
What's he doing on Ord Mantell?

38
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:17,106
This port's connected to
multiple hyperspace routes,

39
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,867
ideal for smuggling.

40
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,578
My parlor's right in the
middle of the action.

41
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,789
Roland saw the value
in it and took it.

42
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,535
But we are taking it back.

43
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,415
- We?
- If I lose, you lose.

44
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:35,263
Don't forget how good I've
been at keeping secrets.

45
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,880
I believe she's threatening us.

46
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,296
You're quick.

47
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,385
When we needed help, we
came to Cid, remember?

48
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,561
Now she needs help.

49
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,480
We can't just walk away.

50
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,847
You tell 'em, Tiny.

51
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,518
[sighs]

52
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,274
So, what's your plan?

53
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,610
My sources tell me that a
buyer is meeting Roland tonight

54
00:03:57,696 --> 00:04:01,826
to acquire a shipment of spice
he's storing in my back office.

55
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,288
You want to disrupt his supply
chain by stealing the shipment

56
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,370
and thereby sabotaging the deal.

57
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,075
Very good, Goggles.

58
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,825
When the Pykes come to collect,

59
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,667
Roland won't be able to pay,
and he'll be their problem.

60
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,767
Start climbing, tough guys.

61
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,570
[Hunter] Where are we?

62
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,400
Ord Mantell's old
mining tunnels.

63
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,362
These rails run
underneath the city.

64
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:45,118
It's how we're sneaking into
my parlor to steal the spice.

65
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,555
[Wrecker] Well, why don't we
just walk in there and take it?

66
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:48,829
We can handle those guards.

67
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,833
No one can know we're involved.

68
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,415
Roland is one thing,

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,130
but the Pykes aren't an
enemy you want to make.

70
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,381
We'll use these carts to
transport the crates of spice.

71
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,625
[Tech] They're not in the best shape,
but I can get the motors operational.

72
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,638
No. Motors are too loud.

73
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,020
This is a stealth mission. You
boys are good at that, right?

74
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,137
Tiny, Goggles, you're with me.

75
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,861
[carts creaking,
rattling quietly]

76
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,262
[brakes squeaking]

77
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,434
Now, listen up.

78
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:50,312
When we pass through those
doors, not a peep out of anyone.

79
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,852
We don't want to wake the hive.

80
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,146
[Echo] The what?

81
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:59,066
The caverns have a slight
infestation problem.

82
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,400
[Wrecker chuckles] We're
not afraid of a few bugs.

83
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,737
Well, it won't be a problem if
everyone keeps their traps shut.

84
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,078
Big guy, get the door.

85
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,611
[screeching in distance]

86
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,725
- [wings flapping]
- [Wrecker] Wha...

87
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,911
[whispering] What was
that? Oh. [Grunts]

88
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,210
[gasps]

89
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,172
What did I say?

90
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,922
[Wrecker scoffs]
It was an accident.

91
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,128
- [rumbling]
- [screeching]

92
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,429
[rumbling, screeching continue]

93
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:21,977
[rumbling, screeching stop]

94
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,239
[Hunter] Keep moving.

95
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,970
[Cid] We're here.

96
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,561
[Wrecker muttering, panting]

97
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:57,021
This ladder leads into my
back office. Up you go.

98
00:07:57,102 --> 00:08:00,812
[Tech] Without eyes on the office,
how do we know Roland is not inside?

99
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,607
I've got that covered.

100
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,648
[beeping]

101
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,154
[chiming quietly]

102
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,236
[electronic music playing]

103
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,968
[grunts, squeals]

104
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,442
[sniffing]

105
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,034
[chewing]

106
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,947
[Ruby squeals]

107
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,775
Ruby?

108
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:57,412
Don't just stand
there. Find her!

109
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,839
[Ruby squeals]

110
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,551
- [comm beeps]
- All clear.

111
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,243
[Echo] Ugh. And I thought
Wrecker was a slob.

112
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,120
[Cid on comm] Can the commentary.
Roland won't be gone for long.

113
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,333
[Tech] Six crates
of spice confirmed.

114
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,793
[Wrecker] Here. Hand it over.

115
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,313
Where is she?

116
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,391
We looked everywhere.
Can't find her.

117
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,270
Keep looking.

118
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,154
[shushes] Keep that thing quiet.

119
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,693
[stammers] Give it more mix.

120
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,776
[groans]

121
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:12,778
[Ruby screeches]

122
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,322
Now you've done it.

123
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,947
[screeching continues]

124
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,501
Okay. New plan!

125
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,580
You coward!

126
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,842
[squeals]

127
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:30,713
[Roland] There you are.

128
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,630
[Ruby panting]

129
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,599
Good girl.

130
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,638
After them.

131
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,641
Out of time, boys.

132
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,148
- Get the last two crates.
- [Echo] I'll seal the door.

133
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,360
Don't worry. We'll catch
those two and kill them.

134
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,605
Yes, we will.

135
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,034
From now on, you
need to stay close.

136
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,577
[Ruby purring]

137
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,722
The spice.

138
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:23,929
It's gone!

139
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,821
[Cid] That's secure
enough. Let's go.

140
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,993
Found them!

141
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,218
[Wrecker] We've got incoming!

142
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:04,352
- I said no blaster fire.
- [Wrecker] Tell that to them!

143
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:08,564
[masked guard] Huh?

144
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,185
[screaming]

145
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:12,106
[grunts]

146
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,911
[masked guards scream]

147
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,831
If those laser brains woke
the hive, we're all dead.

148
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:30,789
[screeching]

149
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,205
What's that sound?

150
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,387
Cid, I don't like this.

151
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,595
[rumbling]

152
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,848
Power up the engines!

153
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,437
[Wrecker] We've got more coming!

154
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,396
[screeching]

155
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,698
[screams]

156
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,115
[screeches]

157
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,786
[Tech] They're avoiding the
light. Use your torches.

158
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,286
[screeches]

159
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:24,644
Not the spice!

160
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,227
- [Echo] Forget the spice. Let's go!
- Wrecker, seal them in.

161
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,964
[sighs] Whew! [Groans]

162
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,671
Well, at least we got
rid of the spice, right?

163
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:15,399
I didn't anticipate Cid
to be so bold or foolish.

164
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,267
It... It was all her idea.

165
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,858
- We swear.
- Yeah, it was a distraction.

166
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,864
We weren't gonna
hurt Ruby. Honest.

167
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,906
Tell me where Cid took my spice!

168
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:30,116
We don't know. She didn't say.

169
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,537
Get them out of here.

170
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,002
[Pyke] Where is our payment?

171
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,844
[Roland] The
shipment was stolen.

172
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:41,126
You'll get your money,
but I need more time.

173
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,844
[Pyke] We did not
come to hear excuses.

174
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:50,596
If you cannot deliver as promised,
you are of no further use to us.

175
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,095
I said you'll get your money.

176
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,816
I suggest you go back
to Oba Diah and wait.

177
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,646
[Pyke] You are out of
your depth, Durand.

178
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,699
Either you correct
this grave mistake,

179
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:13,291
or you and your entire family will
experience what pain truly feels like.

180
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,850
Are you sure your parlor's safe?

181
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,178
Bolo and Ketch said the Pykes
already came for Roland.

182
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:35,685
I told you they don't take
kindly to unpaid debts.

183
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,325
See? My plan worked
like a charm.

184
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,618
Even better than expected.

185
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,707
That's her. She's
the one you want.

186
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:03,552
[Pyke] It has come to my attention that
you have stolen our shipment of spice.

187
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:09,684
Return it to us, and we will
consider this issue resolved.

188
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:14,351
Not sure what he's been telling
you, but we don't have any spice.

189
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,234
[Pyke] Kill them all.

190
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:22,111
Wait. We don't have the spice
on us, but we know where it is.

191
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:26,070
[Pyke] My patience
is wearing very thin.

192
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,532
If you know where the spice is,

193
00:16:28,613 --> 00:16:31,833
then you should have no
problem retrieving it.

194
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:36,158
Until you do, the
child stays here.

195
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,252
Not happening.

196
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,590
[Pyke] You misunderstand.

197
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,340
This is not a negotiation.

198
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,388
If I may…

199
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,765
You all don't realize
who you're dealing with.

200
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:02,441
If you don't lower your blasters,
we're all gonna wish we were dead.

201
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,110
Let me handle this.

202
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:11,195
We can't leave Omega with them.

203
00:17:11,281 --> 00:17:15,411
We don't have a choice, but
we know where the spice is.

204
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,663
We'll return it, and
the kid will be fine.

205
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:21,877
The ptero-creatures we encountered
in the cavern are Irlings.

206
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:26,299
They are nocturnal insects with visual
sensitivity to thermal registers.

207
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,085
Our best chance is to
strike before nightfall.

208
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:33,934
Muscles and I will rappel down into
the cavern and locate the crates.

209
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:38,477
I got the kid into this
mess, and I'll get her out.

210
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,139
[Wrecker groans] You've
gotta be kidding me.

211
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:22,354
And this time, don't drop it.

212
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:57,969
- [cracks]
- [gasps]

213
00:18:58,054 --> 00:18:59,144
- [exhales]
- [screeches]

214
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,728
[whispering] Found one.

215
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,898
I'll secure it.

216
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,816
Start looking for
the other crates.

217
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,316
Quietly.

218
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:35,884
Don't try it. They'll kill you.

219
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,721
If your friends don't return
the spice, we're both dead.

220
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,768
That's what happens when you
meddle in other people's business.

221
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:45,309
Us?

222
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:47,733
You're the one who took
Cid's parlor from her.

223
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,822
You take what you want.
That's the Durand way.

224
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,244
It's a tactic my
mother has perfected.

225
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,453
So, she's a criminal too?

226
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,827
Ugh. You make it
sound so undignified.

227
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:01,909
[chuckles]

228
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,499
If she saw me now…

229
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,289
[whimpers]

230
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,788
[purring]

231
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,086
[sighs]

232
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,462
Ruby doesn't take a
liking to many people.

233
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:18,215
Don't worry, Ruby.
We'll get out of this.

234
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,284
Crates three and
four are aboard.

235
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,897
It's almost night.

236
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:40,277
Those things are gonna wake up.

237
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,615
I am preparing for
that possibility.

238
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,082
[Wrecker grunts]

239
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:54,127
Last crate… [exhales
heavily] …in hand.

240
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,422
Rest later.

241
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:56,665
Final crate secure.

242
00:20:58,383 --> 00:20:59,473
Bring us up.

243
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:11,228
Quit squirming.

244
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:15,939
[cable groaning]

245
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,239
[Wrecker] Oh.

246
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:27,003
[whispering] Maybe
they didn't hear it.

247
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,749
I don't think we're that lucky.

248
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,921
Yeah, me neither.

249
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,510
[rumbling]

250
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,676
[Wrecker screaming on
comm] Get us out of here!

251
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:50,097
Wrecker. What's going on?

252
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:52,055
[Cid] Irlings. Lots of 'em!

253
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:53,765
[Wrecker] Help!
Help me! Help me!

254
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,645
Watch out for the spice.

255
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:57,438
[Wrecker screaming]

256
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,025
Tech.

257
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,740
This should distract them.

258
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,700
Incoming!

259
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,084
[screaming continues]

260
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,286
[screeching]

261
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:31,268
See, Muscles? That
wasn't so bad.

262
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:34,101
[Wrecker muttering] Yeah,
I'm okay. I'm okay. Phew!

263
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:52,658
[Pyke] Since the spice has been returned,
the matter between us is resolved.

264
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,793
- But not with you.
- [Ruby squeals]

265
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,338
Don't!

266
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,223
He made a mistake. That's all.

267
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,723
She's right.

268
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,135
Kill him and you'll be
starting a war with Isa Durand.

269
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,435
Do you want that heat right now?

270
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,806
Call this a bad
deal and walk away.

271
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:22,145
[Pyke] We do not
accept bad deals.

272
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,112
[screams]

273
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,745
Our business is finished.

274
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:36,367
It would not be wise for
our paths to cross again.

275
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,341
Are you okay?

276
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:50,136
It's a small price to pay.

277
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,559
[Ruby whimpers, pants]

278
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,020
I'll be going now.

279
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:06,818
Come on, boys.
First round's on me.

280
00:24:06,905 --> 00:24:10,025
[scoffs] You owe us
way more than that.

281
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,866
Don't push your luck.

282
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:22,839
Why did you stick up for
him after what he did?

283
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:24,922
I don't know.

284
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:26,715
Ruby likes him.

285
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,890
Maybe he's not all bad.
