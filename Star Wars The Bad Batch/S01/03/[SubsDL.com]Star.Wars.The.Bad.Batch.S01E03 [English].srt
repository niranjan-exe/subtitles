1
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:45,214
Well, that doesn't look comfortable,
for either of you.

2
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,760
We're fine.

3
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,417
Here. Chow time.

4
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,549
Ah, finally!

5
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,601
Hit me again.

6
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:02,314
Well, that's all for now. Rations are low.

7
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,265
[groans]

8
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,269
You can have mine.

9
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:09,072
Hey, Omega doesn't even
have a place to sleep.

10
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,822
You wanna take her food too?

11
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,029
Oh. Uh...

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,240
No, no, thanks. You keep it.

13
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,754
Okay.

14
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,496
[groans] I guess I'm not used to
having a kid around here.

15
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,625
Well, none of us are,
but she's not complaining.

16
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,715
Echo, lights cut out again.
I thought you fixed it.

17
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,802
Yeah, add it to the list.

18
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,430
The ship got hit hard
when we fled Saleucami.

19
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,436
Several systems
have been glitching ever since.

20
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:45,269
Repairs would go faster
if I had some help.

21
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,475
As soon as I finish building this scanner.

22
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,525
Testing the functionality
of our inhibitor chips takes precedence.

23
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,860
But I thought you said
they were defective.

24
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,366
A theory this device
will be able to prove.

25
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,278
Besides,
the ship-wide diagnostic report indicated

26
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,368
no critical systems were compromised.

27
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,253
[rumbling]

28
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:11,417
Getting thrown out of hyperspace.
I'd say that's pretty critical, Tech.

29
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,046
It's not affecting life support.
We're fine.

30
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,804
Are you kidding me?

31
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,425
The power capacitor's blown.
We need to land immediately.

32
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,472
Get ready for your first crash landing.

33
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,268
-Crash?
-Omega, strap in.

34
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,105
[groans] I can't see anything!

35
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,778
Hold on!

36
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,908
[grunts]

37
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,081
[droid honking]

38
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,924
Ow!

39
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,836
[alert blaring]

40
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,295
We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

41
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,925
We're gonna... be fine.

42
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,183
We're gonna be fine.

43
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,818
Everybody all right?

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,360
[panting]

45
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,611
Is it over?

46
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:26,623
The storm's getting worse.
It's knocking out our comms.

47
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,830
I suspect one of our capacitors
sustained damage

48
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,798
during our firefight with the regs.

49
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,918
We won't be able to take off
without replacing it.

50
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:38,796
Inventory analysis indicates
we have one spare onboard.

51
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,354
[grunts] Is it in here?

52
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,846
What?

53
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,900
That's Crosshair's weapon kit.

54
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,360
[groans] Fine.

55
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,284
I'll say it. I kinda miss him.

56
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,204
He shot you, remember?

57
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,492
Ha! I sure do. That hurt!

58
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,407
It's worth noting the possibility
that Crosshair's actions

59
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,867
were influenced by his inhibitor chip.

60
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,168
It can do that?

61
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,421
That's what it was designed to do.

62
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,343
So, it wasn't Crosshair's fault?

63
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,423
Well...

64
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,007
Look, debating this won't fix the ship.

65
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,683
Right now, we need to find that capacitor
and get off this rock.

66
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,900
Greetings, CT-9904.

67
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,698
You will be pleased to know
your vitals are at optimum levels.

68
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,331
Go away.

69
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,411
I am compelled to comply
with your request.

70
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,881
The data shows he's responding favorably
to the procedure.

71
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,010
Let's see if he stays that way.

72
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:02,473
Ah, Governor Tarkin.
Hope I'm not interrupting.

73
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,552
Right on schedule, Rampart.

74
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,347
I hear your chain code implementation
has been most successful.

75
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:12,103
Laying the foundation of our new empire
is of the utmost importance.

76
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:13,897
Indeed.

77
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,483
Is that the enhanced clone
from the report?

78
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,188
[Nala Se] It is.

79
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:23,867
CT-9904 is a top specimen.

80
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,788
What is the status of Project War Mantle?

81
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,198
On schedule, sir.

82
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:32,786
Our top recruits are here to begin
their training under their new commander.

83
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,926
A strong ruling government
requires an increase in soldiers

84
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,929
to maintain order throughout the galaxy.

85
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:49,641
Our facilities are fully capable
of creating more clones for the task.

86
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:53,774
Sustaining such a vast engagement
is not one clones must do alone.

87
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,193
There are other ways
of producing loyal soldiers.

88
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:07,407
May I present our first Elite Squad.

89
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,831
Top soldiers from across the galaxy.

90
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,165
Imagine more squads like this
being trained by skilled clones.

91
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:21,133
Together they would make
a formidable army.

92
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,594
A partnership such as this
could have promise.

93
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:29,555
I believe it will strengthen the future
of this burgeoning Empire.

94
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,977
[snarls]

95
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,285
[Echo] Careful.
Those capacitors hold a massive charge.

96
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,168
[Tech]
I am well aware. I just need to secure it.

97
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,588
[faint snarling]

98
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,712
[Echo] What was that?

99
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,466
[Tech] I'm a little busy at the moment.

100
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,805
[rustling]

101
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,920
[rustling]

102
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:42,844
[Tech] There. That should do it.

103
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,051
[Echo] Tech...

104
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:46,715
[snarling]

105
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,509
[Echo] Look at this.

106
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,481
[Tech] Ah. Well, those weren't there
when we landed.

107
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,979
[sniffs]

108
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,987
[beeping]

109
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,997
Ow! Ow. [groans]

110
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,670
What's wrong with you?

111
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:24,048
Oh! I must've hit my head in the crash.
Ow.

112
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,589
The capacitor's in place,
but other systems are now failing.

113
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,394
Something's causing damage
to the exterior hull.

114
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,258
You wanna narrow that down?

115
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,845
[ship powering down]

116
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,852
[banging]

117
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:44,071
[snarling]

118
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,027
-[gasps] Look!
-What? What is it?

119
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:51,526
Some kind of creature,
about this big, with a long tail.

120
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,074
It ran off with the part.

121
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,619
She's right. The capacitor's gone.

122
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,544
And that was our last one.

123
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,632
The creature is most likely
an Ordo Moon Dragon.

124
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,499
A species that feeds on raw energy.

125
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,627
It was probably drawn
to the capacitor's electric charge.

126
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,625
Well, that would've been good to know
beforehand, Tech.

127
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:14,797
You two get those other systems online.

128
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,218
Wrecker, stay here.

129
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,727
I'll go after the dragon
and get our part back.

130
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,349
I'm fine. I--

131
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,016
You're staying.

132
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,524
I'll go with you.

133
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,476
No, that thing could be dangerous.

134
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,276
I'm part of this squad now too, right?

135
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,700
All right, kid.

136
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,044
Just stay close.

137
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,764
Ow!

138
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,306
I didn't join the military
to be studied and poked at.

139
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:03,563
The war's over.
Who's left for us to fight?

140
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:08,185
With the Empire, I get paid, I get fed,
and I have a roof over my head.

141
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,820
That's more than the Republic
ever did for me.

142
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:20,405
Conscripted recruits will never reach
the same level of military proficiency.

143
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:24,115
Our clones have been trained
since their creation.

144
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,707
Hmm. Skills can be taught.

145
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:31,883
The loyalty of those who willingly enlist
is what I see tremendous value in.

146
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:36,469
A tangible test is in order.

147
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,513
We need to see them in action.

148
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,886
By all means.

149
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,563
Send the clone and your recruits
to Onderon.

150
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,812
I want Saw Gerrera's camp
found and wiped out.

151
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:50,565
Let's see if they can succeed
where Clone Force 99 failed.

152
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,200
It shall be done.

153
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,659
[wind howling]

154
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,885
What are you doing?

155
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,635
Tracking.

156
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,186
[Omega] Could I learn to track like you?

157
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,863
[Hunter] Well, it's an enhanced skill.

158
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,282
Wrecker and Tech, we each have one.

159
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,742
[Omega] And Crosshair.

160
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,241
You shouldn't be angry at him.

161
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,946
He can't help it.

162
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:47,826
[sighs] I'm angry at myself.
We don't leave our own behind.

163
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,997
Then we'll find a way to get him back...
somehow.

164
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,225
Why would they put him in charge?

165
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,153
Problem?

166
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,725
Tell me this, clone.

167
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:17,446
If you all are so efficient, how come
the Empire's scouting soldiers like us?

168
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,778
Sounds to me like it's time for a change.

169
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,084
Enjoy being commander for now.

170
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,754
We'll see how things shake out.

171
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,677
Sir, just received a transmission
from Gerrera.

172
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,437
He's standing by at the rendezvous.

173
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,349
All right. Let's move out.

174
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,395
-[device beeping]
-Wait.

175
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,783
A sensor's been triggered in sector 2A.

176
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:58,991
Alert the others.

177
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,665
-[woman screams]
-Get our people on the shuttle now!

178
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,135
[coughing]

179
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,355
[beeping]

180
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,826
[Hunter] See it?

181
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,577
Wait here.

182
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,960
[beeping]

183
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,376
[snarling]

184
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,434
[roars]

185
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,731
It's getting away!

186
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,073
[groaning]

187
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,938
Hunter, your mask!

188
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,235
[coughing]

189
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,777
Hunter, wake up! Wake up!

190
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:33,286
Echo, Wrecker, Tech, come in!
We need help!

191
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:49,062
[sighs] Okay, Omega. You can do this.

192
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,593
[grunts]

193
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,257
[screams]

194
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,862
[grunting]

195
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:49,865
[groans]

196
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,370
[grunting]

197
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,966
[Crosshair] Where's Gerrera?

198
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,642
I don't know,
but I wouldn't tell you if I did.

199
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,060
I believe you.

200
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,856
Do any of you have information
you'd like to share?

201
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,149
We don't know anything.

202
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,612
We were promised transport off world,
that's all.

203
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,403
Then you're of no use to the Empire.

204
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,907
[ES-01] What are you doing?
Gerrera's fighters are dead.

205
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,660
These are civilians.
We should bring them in.

206
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,371
Those weren't our orders.

207
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,334
Forget our orders. This is wrong.

208
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,586
So, you're not going to comply?

209
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,419
No. None of us are.

210
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,545
Ignore the clone.

211
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,551
We signed up to be soldiers,
not an execution squad.

212
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,764
We're going to detain the prisoners
and take them in for questioning.

213
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:55,636
You want to know
why they put me in charge?

214
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,097
It's because I'm willing to do
what needs to be done.

215
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,490
Good soldiers follow orders.

216
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,779
Finish the mission.

217
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:54,316
There it is!

218
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,161
Guess I got lucky.

219
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,624
[snarling]

220
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,418
[roars]

221
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,591
[groans]

222
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,595
[gasps, pants]

223
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:18,771
Omega!

224
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,402
Omega!

225
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:32,985
[breathes heavily]

226
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,367
Omega!

227
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:54,049
[sighs]

228
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,171
Omega!

229
00:19:26,249 --> 00:19:27,459
I'm coming!

230
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,924
[grunts]

231
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:37,974
[Hunter] Are you okay?

232
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:40,103
What were you thinking going down there?

233
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,640
[Omega] The mission was to retrieve
the capacitor, wasn't it?

234
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,644
I tracked the dragon, like you did.

235
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,437
Is that my blaster?

236
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,404
Don't worry. I didn't have to use it.

237
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:52,112
I got the part.

238
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,223
It appears your squad is one trooper down.

239
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,885
Unfortunate,
but soldiers know the risks of battle.

240
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:25,021
[Crosshair] Gerrera was already gone,
but the rest of his camp was dealt with.

241
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:29,902
Impressive.

242
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,269
The Clone Commander's new squad
has followed through

243
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,238
where his brethren did not.

244
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:38,488
Further proof
that this initiative has potential.

245
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:42,781
The Clone Trooper program
is a cost prohibitive relic of the past,

246
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:47,077
but until the time is right,
it will continue to serve a purpose.

247
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:49,214
With more time and training,

248
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,590
our forces will be unlike anything
the galaxy has seen.

249
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,836
Then I leave this project
in your capable hands, Admiral.

250
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,218
Thank you, sir.

251
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,020
If Rampart has his way,

252
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,691
conscripted soldiers
will make clones obsolete.

253
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,821
I fear for the future of our operation.

254
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:18,609
We must ensure our clones
remain essential.

255
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:24,195
The original genetic material
from Jango Fett continues to degrade.

256
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:27,414
Then it is time to begin the next phase.

257
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,825
If your experiment
can yield a superior clone,

258
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,375
it will secure our relationship
with this Empire.

259
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:39,091
Such a contingency cannot be
created without a direct source.

260
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,931
The clones required
will not return willingly.

261
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:48,141
[Lama Su] They are Kaminoan property,
and we only need one.

262
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,444
Our survival hinges on it.

263
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:26,299
Tech, get us outta here.

264
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:27,468
Gladly.

265
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,777
Systems are up and running.

266
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,489
Yeah, took you long enough.

267
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:43,609
And where have you been?

268
00:22:43,697 --> 00:22:46,527
Hey, kid. Come with me.

269
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:48,616
Cover your eyes. [chuckles]

270
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,593
Okay. Open 'em.

271
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:03,013
[chuckles] Check it out!

272
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,729
It's your own room.

273
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,582
Well, what do you think?

274
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,988
I thought this place
could feel more like a home.

275
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,907
It's perfect.

276
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,456
Thank you, Wrecker.

277
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:38,289
[chuckles] Oh, uh, it was nothing.

278
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,091
I never had my own room before.

279
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:50,056
Well, you're a part of this squad now too.
