[sighs] Well, this is a first.

3
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:49,418
[Echo] Inspecting every corner of
the ship finally tired her out.

4
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,391
Yeah, she's curious.
I'll give her that.

5
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,557
[sighs] Hunter, she's a child.
What are we gonna do with her?

6
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,441
[Tech] We are coming
up on Saleucami.

Hmm?

12

What's with her?

Whoa.

What is this?

17
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,432
[Tech] That would be dirt.

18
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:21,433
[gasps] It's amazing.

Huh?

[chuckles]

25
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,227
So this friend of yours, what's
he doing all the way out here?

26
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,493
Hiding. That's
what deserters do.

27
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,909
Staying off the radar's not our specialty,
but he's been doing it for years.

28
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,370
And you trust a deserter?

29
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,328
Why not? We're
all deserters now.

30
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,835
What are we looking at?

31
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,133
A booby trap.

32
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,716
Single trip wire.

33
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:39,591
[chuckles] That's cute.

34
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,390
Whoa! [Screams]

35
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,472
Easy, Wrecker!

36
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,891
Was that me?

37
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,610
[Suu] What do we have here?

38
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,231
More clones who
have lost their way.

39
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,526
It's been a while, fellas.

40
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:08,544
I see a few new faces.

41
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Echo and Omega, Cut and Suu.

42
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,877
Pleased to meet you.

43
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,092
Ma'am.

44
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,674
Where's Crosshair?

45
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,929
It's complicated.

46
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,181
Sounds familiar.

47
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,313
Rex told us about the clone
troopers turning against the Jedi.

48
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,181
You talked to Rex? When?

49
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,687
Well, he passed
through yesterday.

50
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,274
Where'd he go?

51
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,855
Didn't ask.

52
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,610
He was going on about
some behavioral implant.

53
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,027
He must mean the inhibitor chip.

54
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,529
The what?

55
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,447
Inhibitor chips.

56
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,582
The Kaminoans implanted them in the
clones to modify their behavior.

57
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:50,171
Tech, you said the regs were programmed
but you never mentioned a chip.

58
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,828
How else did you
think it worked?

59
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:54,094
Mom, Dad!

60
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,836
There's a ship outside!

61
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,921
Shaeeah, Jek! Remember me?

62
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,718
- Uncle Wrecker!
- Uncle Wrecker!

63
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,514
Who are you?

64
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,522
Omega.

65
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,234
We never see kids around here.

66
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:13,771
Come with us.

67
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,924
[squawking]

68
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,304
Mm... what's the
purpose of this?

69
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,434
To have fun. Here, you try.

70
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,512
Huh?

71
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,102
You're supposed to catch it.

72
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,185
Oh.

73
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:58,897
All right, out with it.
What's with the girl?

74
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,403
She's a defective
clone, like we are.

75
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,566
Not exactly.

76
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,123
What do you mean?

77
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,949
The Kaminoans don't
create without a purpose.

78
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,575
You all have one,
so what's hers?

79
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,921
It doesn't matter.
She's just a kid.

80
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:20,011
Mm. Battling droids was easy
compared to raising a child.

81

[chuckling]

82
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,763
You have no idea
what you're in for.

83
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:28,183
We didn't have a choice.
Kamino wasn't safe anymore.

84
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,223
Well, neither is Saleucami.

85
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,846
Rex warned us of the
storm that's coming.

86
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,814
Clone troopers have
already started showing up.

87
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,565
I'm heading into town to book
us a transport off-world.

88
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,858
We can take you
where you need to go.

89
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,282
Nah, you're wanted
men. It's too risky.

90
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,452
I have to do what's
best for them.

[chattering]

95
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,637
Troops should be pulling their forces,
not securing a post. The war is over.

96
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,314
[chuckles] Well, it
doesn't feel that way.

[PA: Indistinct]

98
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,327
They started seizing
ships about a week ago.

99
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,331
Military ships?

100
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,004
All ships.

101
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,093
They're tagging them
inside that impound lot.

102
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,250
The stall's up ahead.

103
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,587
Let's book the shuttle
before we're spotted.

104
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,639
So, where will you and
your family go next?

105
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:55,310
I suppose find a remote piece
of land on a distant planet.

106
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,732
That's all we really need.

107
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,105
That's the key to
not being found?

108
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,190
You wanna know how to disappear?

109
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,695
Put being a soldier behind you
and make a new life for yourself.

110
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,068
What do you want?

111
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,660
I need to book passage on
the next shuttle out of here.

112
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,418
Those credits won't do you
any good without a chain code.

My what?

115
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,090

[male passenger grunting]

122
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,954
I booked passage
on this transport.

123
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,739
No planetary travel
without a chain code.

Stand down, citizen.

Get in line, get your chain
code, and don't make any trouble.

It's not just ships.

128
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,955
They're registering people too.

129
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,841

gonna be harder than I thought.

00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:12,586
Nice one.

132
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,774
I'll get it.

133

00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,433
Come on.

167
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,607
Hey, kid. You all right?

168
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,864
She'll be fine.

169
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,534
All in all, I would say that
could've gone much worse.

170
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,503
Tech, you think you could
forge some chain codes?

171
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,499
I only learned of them
moments ago, but yes.

172
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:51,502
Do it. We're getting Cut, Suu
and the kids on that shuttle.

173
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,861
[sniffles]

174
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,369
[sighs]

175
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,875
Need another set
of eyes out here?

176
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,210
Almost forgot how good
of a shot you are.

177
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,763
I owe you one.

178
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,090
Children will always find ways
of getting into trouble, Hunter.

179
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,796
It's what they do.

180
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,136
Protecting them is what we do.

181
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:47,561
Where's Omega?

182
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,941
She wanted to stay on the ship.

183
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:54,271
I've been thinking
about what you said.

184
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,031
And you're right,
she's not a soldier.

185
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,855
Just give her some time.

186
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,954
When you leave Saleucami, I
want Omega to go with you.

187
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:08,405
You two can give her
something that we can't.

188
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,872
Is that what you really want?

189
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,788
It's what she needs.

190
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,008
It's ironic. Clones wanted
names instead of numbers,

191
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,183
yet now people are signing
up to be given numbers.

192
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,223
It's ingenious.

193
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,597
You could create a database to
identify anyone in the galaxy.

194
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,645
Glad you're impressed,

195
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:37,439
but where are we going to find the data
for these chain codes? And the disks?

196
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,315
Already thought of that.

197
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,572
Clones now control
the spaceport.

198
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,534
There we can tap into their
network and replicate the codes.

199
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:45,616
Then what?

200
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,998
Hunter said they're tagging ships
inside their impound facility.

201
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,579
That is our way in.

202
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,423
You're suggesting we call the
authorities and have them seize our ship?

203
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,669
That is exactly
what I am saying.

204
00:13:56,753 --> 00:14:01,513
I guess if they think it's
abandoned, that just might work.

205
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,007
You did what?

206
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:17,863
Tech!

207
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,691
<i>This was the simplest solution.</i>

208
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,986
Getting our ship impounded
is not my idea of a solution.

209
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,701
We'll meet you at the
spaceport with the chain codes.

210
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,332
I have this under control.

211
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:31,409
[Hunter] <i>There's one big
problem. Omega's on the ship.</i>

212
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,708
I think it's a good plan, Tech.

213
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,133
So much for simple.

214
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,218
[clone trooper 1] Clamp it
down and add it to the list.

215
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,807
We'll run its signature later.

216
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,146
What kind of ship
is this anyway?

217
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:03,323
[clone trooper 2] Looks like a
modified <i>Omicron</i>-class attack shuttle.

218
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,624
[clone trooper 1] It's a mess.
No wonder it was abandoned.

219
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:23,714
So far so good.

220
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,379
Now how can I help?

221
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:30,258
[Echo] You've had enough action
for today. We'll handle this.

222
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,692
[Tech] Go to the security kiosk.

223
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,689
Scomp in, copy the data and grab
the blank disks for me to program.

224
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,773
[Echo] Roger that.

225
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,858
[droid beeping]

226
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:19,935
I don't see any disks, Tech.

227
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,191
<i>They'll be locked in
a safe compartment.</i>

228
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,696
Ah. Found 'em.

229
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,036
<i>Excellent.</i>

230
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,939
Tech, we're in the spaceport.
What is your status?

231
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,992
In progress. The encryption
shouldn't be a problem.

232
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,764
Mom, I don't like this.

233
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,468
Everything will be okay.

234
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,430
Hurry up. We need those chain
codes to get them on the shuttle,

235
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,643
or we're going to have to
blast our way out of here.

236
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,136
Don't worry.

237
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,977
I can slip through security unnoticed
and deliver the disks to you momentarily.

238
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:46,648
[alert sounds]

239
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,743
[comms chatter]

240
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,831
[Echo] No chance you're getting
past all them undetected.

241
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,808
[Tech] We can't get caught
with these chain codes.

242
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:05,502
We can't get caught at all.
What are you talking about?

243
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,125
If we get tied up in a blaster fight,
they're gonna lock down the whole port.

244
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:13,684
Where'd the disks go?
And where's Omega?

245
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,304
Found her.

246
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,691
[Echo] This great plan of yours
is looking really lousy about now.

247
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:38,953
Have your chain codes out
and ready for inspection.

248
00:18:43,707 --> 00:18:46,077
[Tech] <i>The chain codes are
en route... with Omega.</i>

249
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,417
By herself? You let
her go by herself?

250
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:52,054
- <i>Well, we didn't let her go.</i>
- I'm on it.

251
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:53,842
<i>She ran off on her own.</i>

252
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,425
If something happens to her...

253
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,560
Like I said, kids
always find trouble.

254
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:03,311
[Tech] <i>What is taking so long with the
boot? Are you trying to get caught?</i>

255
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,403
I'm doing my best. You wanna
come out here and give it a try?

256
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,359
Hey, who are you? You
don't belong here.

257
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,321
I'm the maintenance tech.

258
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,109
I've got a situation at bay...

259
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:24,998
[Tech] That is not ideal.

260
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,601
[Echo] We're in
agreement on that one.

261
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:33,879
[chirping]

262
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,838
[beeps, wailing]

263
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,547
No! Don't do that.

264
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:45,184
That hit the spot!

265
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,396
[Echo] <i>Wrecker, we could
use some help over here.</i>

266
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:51,612
On my way.

267
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:54,191
They're waiting for you at
the dock. Better get going.

268
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,582
Halt. Where are you going?

269
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,001
Uh...

270
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,870
Show me your chain
code, citizen.

271
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,456
Sure. I got it right here.

272
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,382
Oh, right, must be in this hand.

273
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:21,216
A couple of locals with
blasters got past the barrier.

274
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,224
[clone trooper]
Next. Step forward.

275
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,271
We're running out
of time, Hunter.

276
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,226
Omega's on her way.

277
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:36,194
No, something's wrong. She
should've been here by now.

278
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,447
Stick to the plan, Cut.

279
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,543
[clone trooper] Let me
see your identification.

280
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,602
- I can't risk it.
- [clone trooper] All right, move along.

281
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,086
We have to find another way out.

282
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,169
[Omega] I'm here.

283
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:59,182
- [whispering] And I have the chain codes.
- [quiet] Yeah, Omega!

284
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:02,349
Tech accidentally made
five disks instead of four.

285
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,099
You didn't tell her?

286
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,350
Tell me what?

287
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,311
[clone trooper] Keep moving.

288
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:23,065
The extra chain code's for you,
so you can leave with Cut and Suu.

289
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:24,488
Why?

290
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:27,366
Did I do something wrong?

291
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,871
You need a family, kid.

292
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:33,036
They're good people. They'll
give you the life you deserve.

293
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:40,718
But... I want to stay with you.

294
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,401
[clone trooper] Quit
holding up the line.

295
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:49,234
You have to go, Omega.
It's for your own good.

What are we waiting for?

308
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:46,585
The clamp's still magnetized.
The system's not responding.

309

Let's go.

313
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:10,951
Wait. Omega's not back.

They need reinforcements
at the impound dock.
