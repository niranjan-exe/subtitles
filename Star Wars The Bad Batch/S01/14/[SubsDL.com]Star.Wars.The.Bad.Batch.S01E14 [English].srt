- [console beeping]
- We're being hailed. It's… Rex.

13
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:32,404
Hello, boys. Sorry to cut right to it,
but I could use your help.

14
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,985
What do you need, Captain?

15
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,820
I received a distress signal
from a clone trooper,

16
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,656
but I'm a bit tied up at the moment
to retrieve him.

17
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,453
You want us to recover a reg?

18
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,706
He's an old friend, and he's in trouble.

19
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,081
I need you to get him out.

20
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,798
Out of what exactly?

21
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,509
[device beeping]

22
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,589
Can't talk right now.
Sending you his signal. I'll be in touch.

23
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,927
What was that about?

24
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:04,392
The distress signal sent by CC-5576
is originating from Daro,

25
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:08,356
a terrestrial planet in the Outer Rim with
no known settlements or installations.

26
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,268
What's he doing all the way out there?

27
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,607
Well, does it matter?

28
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:14,361
We've gone on missions before
without much intel.

29
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,864
But this would be stretching it.

30
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:19,115
Rex wouldn't ask us for help
if it wasn't urgent.

31
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,333
Echo's got a point.

32
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,209
May I remind you that
we are in the middle of a job for Cid.

33
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,918
If we deviate, we will not be compensated.

34
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,919
No money means no food.

35
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,252
Oh, yeah. Tech's got a point.

36
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,218
But Rex's friend is in trouble.

37
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,175
That's more important than getting paid.

38
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,932
Well, the kid's got a point.

39
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,557
Fine. We'll check things out.

40
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,647
But… [sighs] …I don't like it.

41
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,958
The operation is ahead of schedule.

42
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,250
Good.
Ensure every viable clone is mobilized.

43
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,051
And the Kaminoans?

44
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,136
We have our orders.

45
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,479
Keep an eye on them…
until the time is right.

46
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,652
Mistress Nala Se,

47
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,359
isn't leaving the facility
against protocol?

48
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,980
Your training will continue elsewhere.

49
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,992
We'll still be soldiers, won't we?

50
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,030
Of course. That is what you were made for.

51
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,544
You best hurry. I will join you later.

52
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,223
The Empire has canceled
all of our contracts.

53
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,556
[thunder rumbling]

54
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:14,228
Our success with the clone army
is known galaxy-wide.

55
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:21,204
Surely, we will find other clients
who value our scientific advancements.

56
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,409
The Empire is not like the Republic.

57
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,741
We have empowered them
to our own detriment.

58
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:33,748
I fear they will destroy us rather
than allow this operation to continue.

59
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,747
We must leave to ensure our survival.

60
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:42,925
Gather those essential.
I will arrange for our departure.

61
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,219
Yes, Prime Minister.

62
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:59,398
We are approaching Daro's atmosphere.

63
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,574
I'll bring us in low to avoid
any possible tracking scanners.

64
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,698
We're banking a lot on a clone
we don't even know.

65
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,912
- [console beeping]
- Rex trusts him. And I trust Rex.

66
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,352
The signal is coming from that direction.

67
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,938
- [device beeping]
- The beacon should be right ahead.

68
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,324
Found it.

69
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,284
[beacon beeping]

70
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,657
So, where's this reg?

71
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,455
[sniffs]

72
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,168
We're already too late.

73
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,129
The clone was being hunted.

74
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,472
He was dragged.

75
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,676
That way.

76
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,775
[Hunter] Hang on.

77
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:32,237
There's something here,
inside that mountain.

78
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,290
- I believe you are right.
- [beeps]

79
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,792
My scans are being jammed.

80
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,502
You said there was nothing on this planet.

81
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,804
That data appears to be inaccurate.

82
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,958
Wrecker, you and Omega wait on the ship.

83
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:44,877
Wait, why can't...

84
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,804
Coming here was up for debate. This isn't.

85
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,613
[Echo] What is it?

86
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:06,565
[Hunter] A shuttle landed here.

87
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,082
[Echo] What exactly is in that mountain?

88
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,328
[Hunter sighs] Only one way to find out.

89
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,816
[Hunter] This looks like
some sort of military base.

90
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,742
[Tech] Not one that I've ever heard of.

91
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,031
[ship approaching]

92
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,633
[Hunter] Come on. Let's get a closer look.

93
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,652
[Echo] I'm clocking a couple of commandos
and squads of clone troopers.

94
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,649
And they've updated their armor.

95
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,398
Let me see.

96
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,405
[Tech] The mountain's natural composition

97
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,579
makes this base well-fortified
and nearly impenetrable.

98
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,581
This is no longer
just a simple extraction.

99
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,003
Let's get back to the Marauder
and leave word for Rex.

100
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,882
But what about the mission?

101
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:51,219
[Tech] We do not know for certain
if CC-5576 is even in there…

102
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,838
Or if he is still alive.

103
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,059
[Hunter] We'd be going in blind
without any reinforcements.

104
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,096
You did that on Skako Minor
when you rescued me.

105
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,024
I'd still be trapped in that place
if you hadn't.

106
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:08,154
If there's a chance that trooper's
being held against his will,

107
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,243
we have to try to get him out.

108
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,162
It's still your turn.

109
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,581
- I know. I'm thinking.
- [Gonky honking]

110
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,751
- [comm beeps]
- [Hunter] Wrecker, do you copy?

111
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,250
Yeah, we hear ya. Did you find the reg?

112
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,672
Not yet.

113
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,000
But we did find an Imperial base
built inside this mountain.

114
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,629
We're going in.

115
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,974
Wait for us!

116
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,168
We'll help.

117
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,678
Negative. Stay on the ship.
You're our backup.

118
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,851
Comms will be jammed once we're inside,
so keep alert.

119
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:45,653
I'll need to tap into the central database
to pinpoint CC-5576's location.

120
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,269
There are entry points we can access
in the lift shaft. That's our way in.

121
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,837
[Hunter] Get ready to jump.

122
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,026
[Hunter] Anything?

123
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,325
[Echo] This encryption's new.
This might take a while.

124
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,233
[Echo] This doesn't make any sense.

125
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:17,645
The muster report lists 50 clone
commandos and 1,000 TK troopers.

126
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,987
[Tech] TK trooper?

127
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,532
I'm not familiar with that designation.

128
00:12:21,616 --> 00:12:22,776
[Hunter] How much longer?

129
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,367
[Echo] Almost got it.

130
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:28,673
Found him. Cellblock 25, four levels down.

131
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:47,144
Hey, newbie, how about you be useful?
Get me some food.

132
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,015
Quiet, traitor!

133
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,192
That's Captain Traitor.

134
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,189
Insubordinate plebe.

135
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,534
- [punches landing]
- [groaning]

136

[thuds]

137
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,565
Are you CC-5576?

138
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,324
That depends. Who's askin'?

139
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,577
- [beeps]
- [Hunter] Rex sent us.

140
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,449
[chuckles]

141
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:12,287
In that case, the name's Gregor.
Now let's move out.

142
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,060
[comms chatter]

143
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,236
[comms chatter]

144
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,296
They're gathered for inspection.
There's no way past 'em.

145
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,130
[Echo] If we can't reach the lifts,
we can't get out of here.

146
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,466
[Tech] I can redirect them.

147
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,886
[control panel beeping]

148
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,270
Armor like that,
I take it you're CCs like me?

149
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,189
CT-99s.

150
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,648
Defective clones? [Chuckles]

151
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:20,820
If you ask me, it's the ones who want
to stay here who are really defective.

152
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,202
[Echo] What was your assignment?

153
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,448
- I was an instructor...
- [alarm blaring]

154
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,772
[Hunter] What's going on, Tech?

155
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,825
I keyed a Code-16
to redirect their forces.

156
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,120
I don't know what happened.

157
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,873
Clone codes don't work here.
You just triggered a security alert.

158
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,707
Intruders on level six!

00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,181
Is there another way off this base?

163
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:56,518
Only one way out. Up.

164
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,483
[Tech] Look at this.

165
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,106
These are not clone troopers.

166
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,243
[scoffs]
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

167
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,581
These are our replacements.
If you can believe that.

168
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,246
[groans]

169
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:20,961
[groans]

170
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,257
[grunts]

171
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,391
[Tech] Are you sure you know
where you're going?

172
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,560
Hey, I'm the one who escaped here before.

173
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,891
And you were captured.

174
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:36,976
After I made it out.

175
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,942
[groaning]

176
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,534
[Hunter] I thought you said
you trained these guys?

177
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:49,532
I didn't teach them everything.
That wouldn't be very smart, would it?

178
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,326
[alarm blaring]

179
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,247
[groans]

180
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,804
- [beeps]
- [Tech] We need an authorization code.

181
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,434
[Hunter] Got it.

182
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,640
[beeps]

183
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,182
[blaring continues]

184
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:21,773
These new troopers,
what do you mean they're our replacements?

185
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:26,106
Well, we clones are soldiers
of a Republic that doesn't exist.

186
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,784
These recruits come
from all over the galaxy.

187
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,833
They swear loyalty to the Empire.

188
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:35,498
They're not as skilled,
but there's an endless supply of 'em.

189
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,328
[Hunter] Numbers aren't everything.

190
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,757
[Tech] You were saying?

191
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:49,086
We'll, uh, take a detour.

192
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,806
[Gonky honking]

193
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,154
How can you be so relaxed?

194
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:06,859
Oh, I'm preparing.
I'm chargin' up before I charge in.

195
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:10,742
We should've heard from them by now.
What if something went wrong?

196
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:13,582
I'm sure
they got everything under control.

197
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,998
[Tech] Hunter!

198
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,055
[groans]

199
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,209
- [controls beeping]
- [Hunter] How bad?

200
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:08,092
Ha! Don't worry about me. This is nothing.

201
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:10,261
I got blown up once and survived.

202
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,260
[chuckles] I can survive this. [Groans]

203
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:16,263
[Echo] They have all access points
to the central ring blocked off.

204
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,926
[beeping]

205
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,564
There. Those pipes are reactor conduits.

206
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:21,692
And?

207
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,768
Well, they should lead to
the main reactor's external exhaust port.

208
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:27,324
That is our path to the outside.

209
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,189
The exhaust vent's
halfway up the mountain.

210
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,566
We can't survive that jump.

211
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,244
No,
but we would be able to signal our ship.

212
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:39,535
[grunts]

213
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,042
- [Gregor groans]
- [device beeps]

214
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:50,548
[groans, coughs]

215
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,050
How did you even end up in this place?

216
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,473
[sighs]

217
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,721
I was sent here with other commandos…

218
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:57,853
[coughs]

219
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:01,349
…and quickly realized I wanted out.

220
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:02,773
[pants, chuckles]

221
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:07,561
It turns out the Empire
doesn't take too kindly to desertion.

222
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,647
[chuckles]

223
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,072
Yeah, no kidding.

224
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:16,195
- [comm beeps]
- [Hunter] Wrecker, Omega, come in.

225
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,821
- It's them!
- [comm beeps]

226
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:18,907
We read you, Hunter.

227
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,412
We have the target,
but we ran into some trouble.

228
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,164
- We need a pickup.
- On our way!

229
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,666
On our way! [Laughs]

230
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,141
They're escaping through the reactor port!

231
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:48,395
Ooh. [Chuckles]
Glad we're not going that way.

232
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,200
- [comm beeps]
- [Omega] We are on approach!

233
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,441
We see you.

234
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,541
Keep it steady, kid.

235
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:07,873
I'll do my best.

236
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,877
Little closer!

237
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:20,178
Come on!

238
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,938
I can't hold it!

239
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,863
That is sufficient.
I'll take it from here.

240
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,242
Wrecker, get on the tail gun.

241
00:20:48,665 --> 00:20:51,125
[groans, screams]

242
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:02,138
Shields are down. We're losing power!

243
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,518
[Gonky honking]

244
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,149
Gonky, we need you!

245
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:17,572
It's working! Systems are back online.

246
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,709
[beeping]

247
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,717
We're coming back around. Be ready!

248
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:45,179
Jump!

249
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,567
Hunter!

250
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,150
[grunting]

251
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,407
[grunting, groans]

252
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,786
[Gonky sputtering]

253
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,415
[thuds]

254
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,302
- [beeping]
- Multiple system failures!

255
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,802
[Tech] We cannot take many more hits!

256
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:42,242
- [comm beeps]
- Get the ship out of here.

257
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
I'll find another way back.

258
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,196
Negative. The odds of escape
are not in your favor.

259
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:53,455
[Hunter] Go, Tech! That's an order!

260
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:09,175
No! Turn around!
We have to go back for him!

261
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:13,104
Hunter, tell them to come back!
Order them to come back!

262
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,601
Sorry, kid. I can't do that.

263
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:31,905
[beeping]

264
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,325
[thunder rumbling]

265
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,086
Admiral, what can I do for you?

266
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,802
I am disappointed, Prime Minister.

267
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,221
You promised the Empire
your full cooperation.

268
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:48,598
That is what I have given.

269
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:50,427
Mmm.

270
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:53,273
A disturbing matter
has been brought to my attention.

271
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:59,864
Your Chief Scientist was gathering
medical personnel to flee Kamino.

272
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,149
This is most surprising.

273
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:07,906
I will ensure a proper punishment.

274
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:12,083
While I never found your clone troopers
to be overly impressive,

275
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,160
I do believe you will be of great service
to the Empire.

276
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,292
A scientist, I have use for.

277
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,170
A politician, I do not.

278
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,222
I'm afraid
your services are no longer needed.

279
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,344
[thunder rumbling]

280
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,029
I figured you'd show up.

281
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:55,619
[beeps]

282
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:02,997
I was hoping for the whole squad,
but you'll do.
