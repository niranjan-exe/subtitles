How much longer until
we're in hyperspace, Tech?

3
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:46,376
That depends on when Echo plans
on getting the drive back online.

4
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:47,633
I'm working on it!

I don't think Ruby

You named that thing?

8
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,604
What's with these guys?

9
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,522
- Well, we did steal from them.
- [Ruby hisses]

10

Technically, the Rhokai
stole the lizard first.

11
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,442
We are merely intercepting it.

Get it off! Get it
off. Get it off!

16
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,698
Stay calm. You're scaring her.

Get it off. Get it
off. Get it off!

What's your client want it for?

24
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:40,307
Maybe it's a pet. Maybe he wants to turn
it into a stew. Don't know, don't care.

25
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,022
As long as you get paid.

26

Now you're catching on.

27
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,729
And guess what? That
means you get paid too.

28
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,316
Bring the lizard in the back.

What are you two up to?

32
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,632
The mission's over. Can we go?

33
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,090
Again?

34
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,919
It's a tradition.

35
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,545
It makes the kid happy.

00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,842
Uh-huh.

37
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,175
The kid.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

You said the job paid
three times this.

44
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,945
For me, not for you.

45
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,285
And just how is this a mutually
beneficial arrangement?

46
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,291
You're breathing, aren't you?

47
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,923
Rather generous considering
the debt you owe me.

48
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,171
What debt?

49
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:56,797
Docking fees, port charges,
gear, fuel, rations,

50
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,095
and 20 cartons of Mantell Mix.

51
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,179
Best part of the mission.

52
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,393
Mm-hmm.

53
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,978
That'll be 14 credits
for the Mantell Mix.

- [Omega] Mmm.
- Uh, yeah... uh, put it on Cid's tab.

Hey, you're in my seat. Move it!

Oh, he's ignoring you.

57
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,383
You hearing me? I said move it.

Now, I like you boys, but I'm
not running a charity here.

59
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,796
You need a big score
for us to be square.

Like what?

61
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:46,387
Like retrieving that tactical
droid, but you bungled that op.

62
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:51,056
I suggest you figure something
out before you see my ugly side.

63
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,687
That's not her ugly side?

Hey, what's going on in here?

Who are you?

Rex?

72
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,980
Oh, great. Another clone.
Just what I needed.

73
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,185
Well, don't get comfy.

74
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,859
I'm done taking in strays.

75
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,278
This ain't a clone
clubhouse, ya know.

76
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,738
Unbelievable. Thinkin'
they own the place.

77
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,572
Captain.

78
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,118
[Rex] It's been a while, boys.

79
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,703
Where have you been, Rex?

80
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:48,464
Hmm.

81
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,457
That's a long story.

82
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,705
And when the war ended,

83
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:01,046
I guess you could say I've
been... keeping a low profile.

84
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,471
Very low. Imperial files have
you listed as killed in action.

85
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,019
Being dead in the Empire's
eyes has its advantages.

86
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,230
Well, how'd you track us down?

87
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,612
Trace and Rafa Martez.

88
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,939
They said a squad of rogue
clones helped them on Corellia.

89
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,662
They told me I
could find you here.

90
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,700
And that you were
traveling with a kid.

91
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,906
Who is she?

92
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,374
Omega. She's a clone like us.

93
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,540
Well, look who it is. [Laughs]

94
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,625
Come here, Rex. [Laughs]

95
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,133
[grunts] Yeah. Good to
see you too, Wrecker.

96
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,796
I thought you didn't
like the regs.

97
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,505
[Wrecker] This one we like.

98
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:49,431
Omega, this is Rex.

99
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:57,069
I've met many clones in my
time, but never one like you.

100
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,819
You're a generation one.

101
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,779
Now how'd you know that?

102
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,525
From the lines on your face.

103
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,696
[Rex chuckles]

104
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,956
Yeah, I guess I've been around.

105
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,538
You got that right.

106
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,833
[groans]

107
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,376
Tech, I need one of
those med patches.

108
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,711
[Tech] You used the last one.

109
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,416
What's wrong?

110
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,086
Nothing. It's just a headache.

111
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,635
Which are becoming
more frequent.

112
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,854
Is that so?

113
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,690
If you're concerned about the
so-called inhibitor chips, don't be.

114
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,228
Our deviant nature appears to
have impeded their functionality.

115
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,613
Except in Crosshair.

116
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,030
You're telling me you
haven't removed your chips?

117
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,401
No, not yet.

118
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,445
Rex?

119
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,833
Those chips make you a threat to
everyone around you. Even her.

120
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,501
You're all ticking time bombs.

121
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,962
Take it easy, Captain.

122
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:02,263
What's in your head is more
dangerous than you can imagine.

123
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,919
I've seen what happens
when the chip activates,

124
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,588
and I don't want to bury
any more of our brothers.

125
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:13,095
Trust me. It is not
something you can control.

126
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,433
I couldn't.

127
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,484
It's a risk you do
not want to take.

128
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,318
How do you suggest
we get them out?

129
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:31,993
Good question. I'll be in touch.

130

[Gonky honking]

[groans]

132
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,679
[groans] I don't like this plan.

133
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,022
We agreed to meet Rex on
Bracca. That's what we're doing.

134
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,019
He wants to cut open my head.

135
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,981
All of our heads actually.

136
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,231
Not mine. I don't have
an inhibitor chip.

137
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,234
Why not? Now, that's not fair.

138
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,936
How's the chip scanner coming?

139
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:08,736
Since Rex's chip was removed, I
am able to establish a baseline

140
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,952
by comparing his
brain scan to ours.

141
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,792
Allowing for the detection
of any cellular anomaly.

142
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,794
He means, "It's
almost finished."

143
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,420
Do we really have to do this?

144
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,920
If Rex is sure, we
should trust him.

Right on time.

150
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,585
How's a junk planet
gonna help us?

151
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,680
[Rex] Follow me.

152
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:28,864
Bracca may not be much to look at,
but it has exactly what we need.

153
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:33,163
I had my inhibitor chip taken out
on a Jedi cruiser just like that.

154
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,449
That's where we're heading.

155
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,510
[Wrecker] Then why'd we
land all the way over here?

156
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:37,544
[Hunter] Everyone down.

157
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,084
[Rex] That's why.

158
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,040
[Tech] It's the Scrapper Guild.

159
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,206
[Rex] They control
this entire planet.

160
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,341
We need to keep out of
sight from their patrols.

161
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,633
Let's move.

162
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:07,975
Fives tried to warn me about the chips,
but I didn't understand at the time.

163
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,106
[Echo] It's still
hard to believe now.

164
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,817
[Rex] How did you boys
find out about them?

165
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:13,914
[Echo] Omega.

166
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:15,874
[Rex] The kid?

167
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,496
[rumbling]

168
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,577
[metal groaning]

169
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,011
[Omega] Whoa.

170
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,589
It's much bigger up close.

171
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,472
[Rex] This is an original <i>Venator</i>-class
ship from the first batch off the line.

172
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:45,269
[Wrecker] First off the line,
huh? Just like you, Rex.

173
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,353
[laughs]

174
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:52,735
[Tech] What is it?

175
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,527
[Hunter] Stay above
the waterline.

176
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,293
[metal rumbling, groaning]

177
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:22,967
[Rex] The last time I was aboard
one of these it didn't end so well.

178
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:27,268
[Echo] If the inhibitor chip
isn't something you can control,

179
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,904
how'd you get yours out?

180
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,777
[Rex] I had help.

181
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,608
[water splashes]

182
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,816
The medical bay's
at the other end.

183
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,406
Wrecker, grab that cable.

184
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,580
[Wrecker] This? W-Why? W-W-What
are you gonna do with it?

185
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,377
- [Rex] Nicely done.
- [Omega grunts]

186
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,502
[Echo] You're up, Wrecker.

187
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,666
[Wrecker] Uh...

188
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:58,676
Yeah, my head doesn't hurt anymore.
I'm fine. You guys go without me.

189
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,600
You can do it. Just keep
your eyes on the cable.

190
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,010
[Wrecker groans]

191
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,428
[grunts, exhales]

192
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,477
Whoa!

193
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,068
Whoa!

194
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,201
That was close.

195
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,199
- [Wrecker screams, grunts]
- [Rex] Wrecker!

196
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,834
[Wrecker] Whoa, whoa! [Grunts]

197
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,748
[grunting]

198
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,040
[Rex] Are you all right?

199
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,544
[Wrecker] No! Smells
awful down here!

200
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,627
[gags]

201
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,804
- What's that?
- [Hunter] Wrecker, start climbing.

202
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,013
- [Wrecker] Why?
- Hurry!

203
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,182
- [dianoga roars]
- [Wrecker grunts, shouts]

204
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,184
- Wrecker!
- [Hunter] Grab the cable. Get him up.

205
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,394
[Wrecker grunts]

206
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,725
[dianoga screams]

207
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,521
[Wrecker] Faster! Pull faster!

208
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:53,815
- [dianoga roars]

[water bubbles]

215
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,325

00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,127
[Hunter, Rex grunting]

217
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,880

- [dianoga growls, screams]

[Wrecker coughs]

[Rex breathing heavily]

224
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,018
Makes you miss battling
clankers, doesn't it?

225
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,487
[groans] Yeah.

226
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,028

[rat squeaks, chatters]

230
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,390
This will do nicely.

231
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:07,098
[Tech] I would no longer call this
medical bay a sterile environment.

232
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,230
Do you prefer to use
the facility on Kamino?

233
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,518
[Tech] This will do nicely.

234
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,555
I'll calibrate the surgical pod.

235
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,083
- [screen beeps]
- [electricity pulsating]

236
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,324
Time to get scanned, Wrecker.

237
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,698
Let's get this over with.

238
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:29,905
[groans]

- [device whines]
- [Wrecker groans]

242
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:54,643
Hunter, just because the surgery
worked on Rex, doesn't mean it's safe.

243
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,899
This is dangerous.

244
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:01,531
It's more dangerous to leave
their inhibitor chips in.

245
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,029
We have to do this.
It's worth the risk.

246
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,123
And what if
something goes wrong?

247
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,946
I'll be left here with no one.

248
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,421
We're not going anywhere, Omega.

249
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,210
You're stuck with
us for the long run.

250
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,546
Got it?

251
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,219
[scanner beeping]

252
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,681
[Tech] I think I
found something.

253
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,682
Ninety degrees from his
right orbital floor,

254
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,845
below the parietal and
temporal intersection...

255
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,734
Get that away from me.

256
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,112
[groaning]

257
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,769
Something's not right.

258
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,727
We need to speed this up.

259
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,164
[pod hums]

00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,408
[machinery whirs, clanks]

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,709
[Rex] You boys got lucky.

262
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,749
Very few clones were immune
to the effects of Order 66.

263
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,631
It's rare.

264
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:07,472
When the regs attacked the Jedi on
Kaller, we didn't understand why.

265
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,180
[groaning continues]

266
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,560
[Hunter] We couldn't save the general,
but at least we helped the Padawan escape.

267
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,810
Relax, this won't hurt a bit.

Wrecker.

271
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:31,236
You're in direct

Wrecker?

274
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,259
He'll destroy the equipment if
we don't get him out of here.

275
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,012
[Wrecker] You're all traitors.

276
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,680
We'll draw him out.

277
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,564
Omega, stay with Tech.

This isn't you, Wrecker.
It's the inhibitor chip.

Conspiring with traitors
makes you guilty of treason.

Please, stop. I don't
want to hurt you.

Wrecker!

317
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,137
He should be awake by now.

Why don't you take Omega

[Omega] No.

324
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,735
I'm staying until he wakes up.

325
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,186
[Wrecker grunts]

326
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:15,441
Hey, kid. Why...
Why the long face?

327
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,775
He's awake!

328
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,145
Oh. You made it.

329
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,447
- Welcome back.
- [Wrecker chuckles, groans]

330
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:27,583
One chip down. Three
to go. Who's next?

331
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,170
[machinery whirs]

332
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,271
[Wrecker grunts]

333
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,098
Listen, Omega.

334
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:54,976
About what happened...

335
00:21:57,025 --> 00:22:02,405
I... I tried to control it.
I tried as hard as I could.

336
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:05,409
I just couldn't make it stop.

337
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,162
I know, Wrecker. It's okay.

338
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:12,214
But still... I... I'm sorry.

339
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,127
[gasps]

340
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,592
The mission's over.

341
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:21,299
We can't break tradition.

342
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,090
Thanks, kid.

343
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,512
[chuckles]

344
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:30,637
[Omega] Mmm.

345
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,396
[person speaks on
comm, indistinct]

346
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:39,981
Copy that. I'll meet you at the
rendezvous by the next rotation.

347
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:43,282
I figured you weren't out
of the fight just yet.

348
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,540
I spent my life defending
the Republic. Can't stop now.

349
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,579
The Republic's gone, Rex.

350
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:57,843
Ah, not all of it. We're here.
Others are out there too.

351
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,882
Your squad's skills would
be a tremendous asset.

352
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:07,345
Things aren't like before.
Our priorities have shifted.

353
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,101
So I've noticed.

354
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:14,385
Omega needs us, and I have to
do what's best for my squad.

355
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,691
Which is what?

356
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,145
I'm still figuring that out.

357
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:22,396
I guess we all are.

358
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:27,066
When you sort things out,
let me know where you land.

359
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:29,277
Tell the boys I'll
see them around.

360
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,827
[Hunter] Stay out of trouble.

361
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,580
Funny. I was gonna
say the same to you.

362
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:35,706
Well...

363
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,078
Take care, trooper.

364
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,129
[Hunter] Captain.

365
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:47,677
If you're ever in a bind,
you know how to reach us.

366
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:11,911
[scrapper] Intruders confirmed on
the Jedi Cruiser. Notify the Empire.
