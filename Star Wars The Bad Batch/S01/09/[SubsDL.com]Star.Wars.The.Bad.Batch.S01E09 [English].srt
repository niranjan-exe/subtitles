1
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:38,501
[laser blasts]

2
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,418
Any sign of that bounty hunter?

3
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,841
The only vessel in our
scanners is Crosshair's

4
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,260
and he is right on top of us.

5
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,045
Don't let them get away.

6
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,223
It's getting hot back here!

7
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,385
Prepping to jump.

8
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:57,473
Not without Omega.

9
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,887
The bounty hunter who
took her is long gone.

10
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,726
We'll have no chance of finding
them if Crosshair shoots us down.

11
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,113
Rear deflector
shields are failing.

12
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,565
[sighs]

13
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,863
Make the jump.

14
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,369
[engine revs]

15
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:28,671
[groans]

16
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,387
- [door opens]
- [footsteps approaching]

17
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,904
Let me out of here!

18
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,320
Afraid not.

19
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,033
- Looking for your communication device?
- [grunts]

20
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,624
It has been confiscated and
placed in a secure compartment.

21
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:02,211
I said let me out of here.

22
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,207
I would advise you to cooperate.

23
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,670
Mr. Bane does not respond well
to prisoners who are difficult.

24
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,430
- How's my asset doing?
- My name is Omega.

25
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Who are you?

26
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,774
Cad Bane at your service.

27
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,267
Where are you taking me?

28
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,452
You'll be sorry when
my friends come for me.

29
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:42,124
Your friends are long
gone. I made sure of that.

30
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,170
No one is coming for
you, little lady.

31
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:50,747
Now sit tight and don't
cause any trouble.

32
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,258
But when will you have
time to fix my leg?

33
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,381
It is quite inconvenient.

34
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,598
Bane, did you hear me?

35
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,851
Mr. Bane. Mr. Bane.

36
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,282
- I have the girl.
- What is her condition?

37
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:18,451
Alive, so I expect a premium.

38
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:21,161
See that she stays that way.

39
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,832
That depends on you.

40
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:27,865
I'll be at the rendezvous.
Bring my unmarked credits.

41
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,459
I will deliver the payment
and retrieve Omega.

42
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:38,466
Your personal interest in the young clone
has threatened our operation enough.

43
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:44,893
Taun We, you will go to our
abandoned facility on Bora Vio.

44
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:49,944
Bring the bounty hunter his
payment and recover our property.

45
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,611
Yes, Prime Minister.

46
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:58,241
When the clone is returned, confine
her to the sublevel facility.

47
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:03,031
Once you have retrieved the genetic
material needed, terminate her.

48
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:16,673
This is all that clone's
fault. He shot my leg off.

49
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:21,052
He was protecting me.
That's what friends do.

50
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,603
Why isn't yours helping you?

51
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:27,232
Well, Mr. Bane is very busy.

52
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,489
I could fix your
leg if you want.

53
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,531
I mean, it's a simple
booster adjustment.

54
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,124
I've done it a bunch of times
for AZI-3 back on Kamino.

55
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,121
[scoffs] I am a
techno service droid.

56
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,504
I am quite capable of
completing my own repairs.

57
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,883
You are a prisoner and
are not to be trusted.

58
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,666
Have it your way.

59
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,852
Your description of the bounty hunter is
a match to one from the Republic's files.

60
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,270
That's him.

61
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,849
Cad Bane.

62
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,983
He had multiple
run-ins with the Jedi

63
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:14,191
and was responsible for attempting
to abduct Chancellor Palpatine.

64
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,652
First the bounty hunter on
Pantora and now this guy?

65
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,194
Why are they after the kid?

66
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,697
Because she is more
valuable than we realized.

67
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,820
What do you mean?

68
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,366
I further analyzed
Omega's genetic profile

69
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,580
and discovered she has
pure, first-generation DNA.

70
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,251
Whoa!

71
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,330
Wait. W-W-What does that mean?

72
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,785
All clones were created from
a host named Jango Fett.

73
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,627
While our genetic structure was modified
for growth acceleration and obedience,

74
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,224
Omega is a pure
genetic replication.

75
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,840
How many clones like that exist?

76
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,137
To my knowledge
there's only one other.

77
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:50,641
A male clone code-named Alpha,
later referred to as Boba.

78
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,226
Since he disappeared at
the start of the war,

79
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:57,901
that makes Omega the sole living
source of Fett's raw genetic material.

80
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,862
If she's vital to the
Kaminoans' cloning operation,

81
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,654
they must have put
the bounty on her.

82
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,367
So how do we find
this bounty hunter?

83
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,278
Tech, check with Cid. See if
her contacts know anything.

84
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,948
We'll keep monitoring comms.

85
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,785
[sighs] No. Not
that way... [grunts]

86
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,143
- Look, you need to rewire…
- [sighs]

87
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,457
…the servos in your hip first.

88
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,205
That is what I am trying to do.

89
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,800
Will you just let me help you?

90
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,933
You are a prisoner.

91
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,011
Exactly.

92
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,556
It's not like I can
escape off this ship.

93
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,136
That is a valid point.

94
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,440
[sighs] I'm only a kid.

95
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,401
Oh, all right,
but make it quick.

96
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,981
And not a word of
this to anyone.

97
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,898
[whispering] Of course not.

98
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,447
[grunts]

99
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,536
[grunts]

100
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,330
- [beeping]
- [clattering]

101
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,552
Okay. Let's get to work.

102
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,130
Do not try anything funny.

103
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,335
Mr. Bane will be back shortly.

104
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,346
How long have you
been working for him?

105
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,718
Many years.

106
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,564
I am his trusted confidant.

107
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,429
We are a team.

108
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,976
Really? He's not
very nice to you.

109
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:19,061
On the contrary, my treatment
is perfectly adequate…

110
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,273
Most of the time.

111
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,688
There. How does your leg feel?

112
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,027
It is misaligned.

113
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,491
You will need to adjust the
calibration, but be careful.

114
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:31,737
Relax. I've done this before.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,290
Oh, my. Yes. That's working.

116
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:46,261
It feels brand-new.

117
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,512
Sorry.

118
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,973
It's only temporary.

119
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,517
Now, where did you
hide my comm device?

120
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,058
[beeping]

121
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,485
Todo, get your chassis up here.

122
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,535
I can't see anything
in this chop.

123
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,039
[ship rattles]

124
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,121
[beeping]

125
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,060
[ship rattles]

126
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,269
Todo, get up here.

127
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,279
Todo?

128
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,913
[sighs] Come on, come
on, come on. Where is it?

129
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,582
Ah, yes!

130
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,421
[Cad Bane] Ya glitchy droid.

131
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,633
What's taking so long?

132
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,062
Todo? Where's the kid?

133
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:22,151
[scoffs] Mr. Bane, she's
quite obviously right there.

134
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:25,018
[gasps] Oh.

135
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,230
[Todo] Uh-oh.

136
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,937
Wait here.

137
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,453
Hello? Is anyone
there? Can you hear me?

138
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:42,961
Yeah. Cid knows all about
Bane but not how to find him.

139
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,001
She said we're on our own.

140
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,840
[Omega] Come in. Come in.

141
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:48,921
- [Omega] Anyone?
- Omega!

142
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,093
Omega, are you there? Omega!

143
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,224
It's long-range. I'll
try to boost the signal.

144
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,765
Is anyone there?

145
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,599
[Hunter] Omega, do you copy?

146
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,555
Hunter? [Gasps]

147
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:06,765
I'm here. I got away,
but you have to hurry.

148
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,612
[Hunter] Where are you?

149
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,203
I… I... I don't know where I am.

150
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,279
[Wrecker] Hang on, kid.

151
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,914
We're coming for ya!

152
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,660
[sighs] The signal's too weak to
establish a direct connection trace.

153
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,834
Omega, we need a relay
of your position.

154
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:27,424
Try to create a power surge.
Can you find a panel nearby?

155
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,840
There's one by a door.

156
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,011
It looks like the
ones on Tipoca City.

157
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,340
[Tech] That's good. First,
see if you can activate it.

158
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:39,932
[power panel charging up]

159
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,388
- [beeps]
- It worked. Now what should I do?

160
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,163
[Tech] Next you will need
to reroute the circuits

161
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,647
to overload the main grid.

162

[Cad Bane] Check it out.

No.

You're lucky they

Fennec Shand.

188
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,224
Hello, Bane.

189
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:06,845
You got no business
messin' with my score.

You of all people know
it's all about the price.

You lack the experience
to be goin' up against me.

Yet, I'm the one
who has the payment.

That's my case you're holdin'.

197
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,997
Hand it over and I'll
let you walk outta here.

How about a trade?

199

The case for the girl.

200
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,759

201
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,143

Where in the Lido system?

What their Prime Minister
has planned for you
