1
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,843
<i>In days of legend,</i>

2
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,179
<i>gods walked the Earth...</i>

3
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,933
<i>and tormented mortals.</i>

4
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:04,230
<i>Athena, goddess of warfare and wisdom,</i>

5
00:01:04,313 --> 00:01:07,150
<i>had the power to destroy humanity,</i>

6
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:09,194
<i>but chose to protect us.</i>

7
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,198
<i>Brave young knights from across the globe</i>

8
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,868
<i>swore their allegiance to her.</i>

9
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,536
<i>They learned to harness Cosmo...</i>

10
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,956
<i>the power of the stars.</i>

11
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:24,793
<i>Their fists cracked to the heavens</i>

12
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,963
<i>in battles against those
who wished Athena dead.</i>

13
00:01:32,134 --> 00:01:33,343
<i>Over time...</i>

14
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:37,306
<i>the gods retreated and became myths.</i>

15
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,767
<i>But then, 18 years ago,</i>

16
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:44,855
<i>Athena was reborn as a helpless child.</i>

17
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:49,526
<i>A knight clad in gold armor</i>

18
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,363
<i>gave his life to protect her
as they crashed to Earth.</i>

19
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:59,161
<i>And that's how I found her,
lying in his arms.</i>

20
00:01:59,244 --> 00:02:01,914
<i>A mortal girl with the power of a god.</i>

21
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,124
<i>Since then,</i>

22
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,836
<i>I've been searching
for a new generation of knights</i>

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,506
<i>to protect Athena and the Earth.</i>

24
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:24,728
<i>We fight to protect ourselves.</i>

25
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,736
<i>But we also fight to protect each other.</i>

26
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,285
<i>There's always something bigger
than you, Seiya.</i>

27
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,664
<i>You'll have to fight
to protect that as well.</i>

28
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,297
You give up?

29
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,382
<i>Never!</i>

30
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,095
Nice try. But not tonight.

31
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,805
-Tap out.
-No!

32
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,557
You must learn when to quit!

33
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,183
Never!

34
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,606
No, Seiya! Don't!

35
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,985
Promise you won't come out.

36
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:13,986
I promise.

37
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,832
Hey, kid!

38
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,085
Come on, you're up next.

39
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,748
You win this fight,
maybe you get a shot at me someday.

40
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,751
Hey! Listen to me.

41
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,170
No more of that dancing around,
you understand?

42
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,005
You make it a good show this time.

43
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,051
Fight this time, asshole.

44
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,678
It's time for the main event!

45
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:26,016
Introducing first,
the undisputed champion of the Octagon.

46
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,478
Give it up for Jaki the Beast!

47
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:35,859
<i>Jaki! Jaki! Jaki!</i>

48
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,534
And the contender,
who literally danced his way

49
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,327
through his first two fights,

50
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:50,082
let's hear it for Street Kid Seiya!

51
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,005
You both know how this works.

52
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,094
You know the rules. There are none.

53
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,847
Anything goes until one of you
gives up or blacks out.

54
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,893
If you give up,
you're banished from the Octagon.

55
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,395
Understood?

56
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,000
Damn it, fight!

57
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,672
Hey! I said, no dancing!

58
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,658
<i>Cassios! Cassios! Cassios!</i>

59
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,785
What, you think you can just ignore me?

60
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,996
Okay, calm down, big guy.

61
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,387
Ballet's over, kid.

62
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,254
Cassios wins.

63
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,421
Every...

64
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:02,673
single...

65
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,757
time.

66
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:15,853
<i>Cassios! Cassios! Cassios!</i>

67
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,501
You give up?

68
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,706
Yeah!

69
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,683
You don't know when to quit, huh?

70
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,144
Yeah.

71
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:40,854
I've heard that before.

72
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,164
We're not done here!

73
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,212
This ain't over!

74
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,058
Come outside.

75
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,937
You're cute, but you're not my type, man.

76
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:30,237
There's someone outside
that wants to speak with you.

77
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,947
He knows about your search.

78
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,576
He knows what you're looking for.

79
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,467
Give me that.

80
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,143
Yeah, it's me.

81
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,440
Think I found one of your Cosmo guys.

82
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,454
I'm out of here.

83
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,542
Your little show in there made
some people upset.

84
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,252
Look, I'm not looking for trouble.

85
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:29,463
You may not be looking,
but you've found it.

86
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:34,009
In a few moments,
Vander Guraad will be here with her boys.

87
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,261
Who?

88
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,263
My ex-wife.

89
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,973
She controls this fighting ring.

90
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,059
It's her recruitment operation.

91
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,561
What does she recruit?

92
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,356
Warriors with special skills.

93
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,649
For her private army.

94
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,984
Okay.

95
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,736
I saw what you did in the ring.

96
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,697
I knew it had to be you, Seiya.

97
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:00,244
Who are you?

98
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,996
I'm the only friend you have.

99
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,458
You need to make a choice, Seiya.

100
00:11:06,542 --> 00:11:10,003
Come with me or try your luck
against Guraad's warriors.

101
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,427
Lead the way.

102
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:25,727
Come on!

103
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,573
Look what we've found.

104
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,542
What are those guys made of?

105
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,335
You don't want to know. Keep moving!

106
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,684
Our ride's just around the corner!

107
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:12,733
Get down!

108
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,959
Go!

109
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,047
Meet Mylock, my assistant.

110
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,095
Those guys work for your ex-wife?

111
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,264
Surrender the boy!

112
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,772
Dude, you gotta make better life choices.

113
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,449
What the hell is that thing?

114
00:13:07,246 --> 00:13:08,747
Hope you had a light dinner.

115
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,441
Why are they after me?

116
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,443
They're after warriors
with a strong Cosmo.

117
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,701
Cosmo? Is that a new martial arts
or something?

118
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,620
You should know.
You tapped into it in the Octagon.

119
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:51,123
I didn't tap into anything.
They got the wrong guy!

120
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,333
Oh, would you like us to stop
and let them know?

121
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,763
God!

122
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:27,534
Hold on tight!

123
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:49,014
I am not going another step
until you tell me what's going on.

124
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,807
There'll be time for that later.

125
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:53,018
We're still in danger.

126
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,478
You're really--

127
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,528
<i>Okay, okay, okay. Go to sleep.</i>

128
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:21,129
Hey. Hey. Wake up. Wake up.

129
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:23,966
Wake up. Come on.

130
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,805
You need to hide. No matter what happens,
you stay out of sight.

131
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,307
I have to make sure
these people don't find you.

132
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,851
Promise you won't come out.

133
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,812
Okay. I promise.

134
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:05,841
Thank you.

135
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,384
For what?

136
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,180
You tapped into your Cosmo.

137
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:14,808
<i>No, Seiya. Don't!</i>

138
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,479
<i>Led me right to your doorstep.</i>

139
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,361
Saved me so much trouble.

140
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:31,033
Let's go!

141
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:32,576
Let's go!

142
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,162
You can't use it. Only the Pegasus can!

143
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,872
That's why you're coming with us.

144
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:03,398
Relax.

145
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:06,359
Relax, we're safe now.

146
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,153
Safe?

147
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:10,239
First I get attacked by ninja cyborgs,

148
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,990
then I got a spaceship shooting at me.

149
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:14,242
And then that freak in a suit drugs me!

150
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,869
Allow me to rephrase it.

151
00:17:16,954 --> 00:17:18,997
You're safer here than with Guraad.

152
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,625
She has already captured
many kids like you,

153
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,917
drained them of their Cosmo.

154
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,127
Stop talking nonsense
and tell me what's going on!

155
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:27,548
-Prepare for landing.
-What?

156
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,925
You might want to buckle up.

157
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,176
No, I want answers now!

158
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:33,053
Oh, shit.

159
00:17:40,018 --> 00:17:41,270
There's no runway!

160
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,108
I said, you might want to buckle up.

161
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:59,121
You couldn't just tell me
this thing lands vertically?

162
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,880
Let's start afresh, shall we?

163
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,424
My name is Alman Kido.

164
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:13,218
Once upon a time, I was a businessman.

165
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:15,762
Mylock, let her know our guest
has arrived, please.

166
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,014
Yes, sir.

167
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,099
Should I believe you went bust?

168
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:24,062
I won't hide the fact
I've been quite successful in my trade.

169
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,940
But the one thing
money can't buy is purpose.

170
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,526
So this is where you store your "purpose"?

171
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,486
Yes.

172
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,575
Tell me, Seiya, what do you see?

173
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:41,205
I'm not sure.

174
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,291
A whole bunch of real old stuff, I guess.

175
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,044
I see stories.

176
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:51,715
Ancient heroes were defined
by their monumental deeds

177
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,842
as much as by their tragic ends.

178
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:59,223
I always admired
the formidable magnitude of their fate.

179
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:05,145
I envied it. I used to think
the ancient lore held no secret for me.

180
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,482
I'm afraid that was my hubris.

181
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,319
What do you know about Athena?

182
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,447
-She was a god of war.
-And wisdom.

183
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:18,617
What if I told you
Athena had returned in human form

184
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,996
and you are destined
to become one of her guardian knights?

185
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,457
I'd say your therapist isn't worth
his paycheck.

186
00:19:26,834 --> 00:19:29,253
Things happen for a reason, Seiya.

187
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:31,046
Your Cosmo brought you here.

188
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,590
Actually, I was brought here
on a very expensive aircraft.

189
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,343
And now I'm leaving on my own two feet.

190
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,556
You know the truth in your heart, Seiya.

191
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:42,140
Your sister knew it too.

192
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:52,651
What do you know about my sister?

193
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:56,738
Ten years ago,
Guraad detected a strong Cosmo

194
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,949
at your location.
She thought it was Patricia.

195
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,367
What did she do to her?

196
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,662
I don't know,
but your sister gave herself up

197
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,039
so that Guraad wouldn't find you.

198
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:08,709
She knew what you were to become.

199
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,628
A warrior of Athena. The Pegasus Knight.

200
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:13,422
The Pegasus Knight?

201
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,841
You're really out of your mind.

202
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,844
That doesn't bode well.

203
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,179
This is Sienna.

204
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,891
Guraad is after her too.

205
00:20:23,974 --> 00:20:25,392
Your mission is to protect her.

206
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,269
I can take care of myself.

207
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:30,022
Why would I ever want
to risk my neck to protect some rich girl?

208
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:35,068
Because our little Sienna here is
the reincarnation of the goddess Athena.

209
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:38,197
-Dad.
-Don't you have something for our guest?

210
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,699
Sure, a toilet,
so he can flush himself out.

211
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:43,076
Wow, spoken like a true goddess.

212
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,122
Dad, come on. This moron can't
seriously be the Pegasus Knight.

213
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:49,833
Go on.

214
00:20:53,504 --> 00:20:54,630
Fine.

215
00:20:54,713 --> 00:20:56,924
You might recognize this, Seiya.

216
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:12,397
This is Patricia's.

217
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,984
That is the key to the Pegasus armor.

218
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:18,987
Without it, you don't stand a chance
against Guraad's army.

219
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,364
I could've handled those guys.

220
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,949
That's not what Mylock said.

221
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:28,038
So how's this supposed
to help me find my sister?

222
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,582
You give me a little present
and expect me to help you out?

223
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,668
My plan is to trust you
to do what is right.

224
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:33,961
And what would that be?

225
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:37,339
I suppose you've never heard of Marin,
the Silver Knight.

226
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,174
God, another one of your old legends?

227
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:41,552
Marin can teach you how to reveal

228
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,220
the hidden secret of the pendant.

229
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,265
So you can protect Sienna,
and yourself, against your enemies.

230
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:48,433
And maybe even help you find your sister.

231
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,185
Ancient gods. Magic knights.

232
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:52,771
Do you have any idea
how totally insane you sound?

233
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:56,400
I know, it is a lot to take in, isn't it?

234
00:21:56,483 --> 00:22:00,320
So why don't we have breakfast,
take the day off and...

235
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,448
revisit this tomorrow. Yeah.

236
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:08,662
Well, I am hungry, but...

237
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,706
A goddess's fate is on the line, but sure.

238
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,791
Let's eat pancakes.

239
00:22:14,376 --> 00:22:15,210
Yeah.

240
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:27,806
Get off my ring, you scum.

241
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:29,766
Get out of my ring!

242
00:22:31,268 --> 00:22:32,853
You moron.

243
00:22:32,936 --> 00:22:34,897
You were supposed to keep a low profile.

244
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:36,815
And I did.

245
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:39,109
We need to shut this place down.

246
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:42,613
-You don't get to decide that!
-That's right. I do.

247
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:44,281
Guraad, come on.

248
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:46,491
We have a great partnership.

249
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:48,410
Yes. We did.

250
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,455
How's the boy's Cosmo?

251
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:52,873
It's legit.

252
00:22:52,956 --> 00:22:55,959
Good news. I've got a new deal for you.

253
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,712
No ring, no deal.

254
00:22:58,795 --> 00:22:59,671
All the better.

255
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:02,549
Nobody needs a loser who gets
his ass kicked by a scrawny kid.

256
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,635
He got a lucky break.

257
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,887
No man gets lucky twice with Cassios.

258
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,473
I can beat anyone, anytime.

259
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:10,933
Well, let's see if that's true.

260
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:30,077
Something wrong?

261
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:36,667
I just don't know how you can breathe
while you're eating like that.

262
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:44,049
Where I come from, you eat
as much as you can, when you can.

263
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:48,053
You never know
where your next meal's coming from.

264
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,267
You wouldn't understand.

265
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:57,062
Rich girl.

266
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:01,233
No, I wouldn't.

267
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,194
But I'm sorry you had to live like that.

268
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,994
Sir. There's an urgent call.

269
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,955
Please excuse me.

270
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:26,216
So...

271
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:29,678
How does it feel to be a goddess?

272
00:24:32,347 --> 00:24:35,517
Well, I'm not a goddess yet.

273
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:37,895
Just Sienna.

274
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:40,772
But her Cosmo is getting stronger
by the day,

275
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:43,442
and someday soon I will become Athena.

276
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,574
Most people would be excited

277
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,285
to have breakfast with a future goddess.

278
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:57,664
Guess I'm not most people, then.

279
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,126
Well, then maybe you should--

280
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:06,215
Maybe I should what?

281
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,973
You should back off.

282
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:16,975
Jeez, don't be so sensitive.

283
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,437
Just get away from me, okay?

284
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:22,064
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-Just get away--

285
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:31,615
Hey!

286
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,118
Dad!

287
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:36,537
Hey!

288
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,122
-Are you okay?
-Wait!

289
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,336
What's going on?

290
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,713
She could kill you right now.

291
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,383
I'm here, sweetheart, just relax.

292
00:25:57,683 --> 00:25:58,809
What just happened?

293
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:06,441
She bears a goddess's Cosmo
in the body of a mortal.

294
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:17,119
When our sensors detect
a potential Cosmo burst,

295
00:26:17,828 --> 00:26:20,497
the building automatically
blocks the signal.

296
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:24,835
It's the only way we can keep
Sienna hidden from Guraad.

297
00:26:24,918 --> 00:26:27,754
Which is why I am stuck here
like a prisoner.

298
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:33,010
Excuse me.

299
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:37,222
Wait. Wait, so... So you really are...?

300
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,736
You really think this guy could beat
the Pegasus Knight?

301
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,989
Perhaps. If we give him the prototype.

302
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:09,046
Next candidate?

303
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:14,551
You giving up already?

304
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:27,272
What the hell are you made of?

305
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,650
Disengage.

306
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:35,822
We ain't done yet.

307
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,705
You made your point, Cassios.

308
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:45,082
You're a strong man.

309
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,126
But you're just a man.

310
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,591
I have a problem.

311
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:56,385
You met him in your ring.

312
00:27:57,219 --> 00:27:58,053
The kid.

313
00:27:58,136 --> 00:27:59,972
His power's a liability.

314
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:04,434
Once he learns to control it,
no living man will be able to stop him.

315
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,479
What, you think I could, though?

316
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:10,524
You know, with your prototype thing?

317
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:12,526
I have a good ear.

318
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:14,820
So, what's your price?

319
00:28:17,197 --> 00:28:18,448
Well, that depends.

320
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,868
Can I kill him?

321
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:22,619
That's kind of the point.

322
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,955
I'll do it for free.

323
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:53,233
-You all right?
-I'm better.

324
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:57,321
-You?
-I'm good. I guess.

325
00:28:59,198 --> 00:29:01,867
It's just that I can't believe
you really are a--

326
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,951
A goddess?

327
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,872
I'm never gonna call you that.

328
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:08,665
That's fine with me.

329
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:13,921
So how do people usually react
when they learn you're Athena?

330
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:15,547
Varies.

331
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:19,426
Like, the day after I was born,
someone tried to kill me.

332
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,511
No.

333
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:25,516
Not even you could annoy someone
that much in just one day.

334
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:29,728
I was told a knight in gold armor
gave his life to save mine.

335
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:33,607
When they found him,
he was still holding me in his arms.

336
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,692
Who found you? Alman?

337
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:37,736
And Guraad.

338
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:42,699
Though she was a little more
into the gold armor.

339
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:47,454
Used it to develop technology
far beyond anything you could imagine.

340
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:49,873
Look at the bright side.

341
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,960
Half your foster family is great.

342
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:56,880
When Alman's around you,
he almost looks like a real dad.

343
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:01,593
Alman is my dad, and I love him
more than anything in the world.

344
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,099
Although that might be hard
for you to understand, street boy.

345
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:09,643
I do.

346
00:30:12,688 --> 00:30:14,523
I had someone like that once.

347
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:17,234
Your sister?

348
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:21,196
What was she like?

349
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,616
She was kind.

350
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:27,953
<i>And strong.</i>

351
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:31,832
And protected me
when I couldn't protect myself.

352
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,210
And you won't stop until you find her.

353
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:38,255
You really don't care that I've become
your bodyguard, do you?

354
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:41,216
I will someday become Athena.

355
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:43,510
I don't have a choice.

356
00:30:43,594 --> 00:30:46,263
But that doesn't mean you have
to become the Pegasus Knight.

357
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:48,015
Alman said it's my destiny.

358
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:50,100
Nobody's destiny is written in stone.

359
00:30:51,602 --> 00:30:52,686
Except yours.

360
00:30:54,229 --> 00:30:56,064
Your Cosmo bursts,

361
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:57,900
do they come with visions?

362
00:30:58,609 --> 00:30:59,943
You have visions too?

363
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:01,195
What does it matter?

364
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,449
Cosmo visions are a window
into the universe.

365
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:08,076
They can show us things.

366
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:14,082
So that Silver Knight
your dad mentioned...?

367
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,792
-Who, Marin?
-Marin.

368
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:18,420
Do you think if he could teach me
to control my Cosmo,

369
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:20,130
I could use it to find my sister?

370
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:22,174
Maybe.

371
00:31:24,301 --> 00:31:25,511
If that's what you want.

372
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:02,840
He's drained of Cosmo, Guraad.

373
00:32:06,134 --> 00:32:07,678
Won't get another dose.

374
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:12,391
The prototype procedure has started.

375
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:14,476
It'll be ready tomorrow.

376
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:16,270
Any issues?

377
00:32:16,895 --> 00:32:17,896
Just one.

378
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,148
Why Cassios?

379
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,359
'Cause you failed.

380
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:27,990
You know, the target was assisted
by Alman Kido.

381
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,033
A personal bad penny.

382
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:33,620
Athena's growing stronger by the day,

383
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:36,540
and now she'll have
the Pegasus Knight by her side.

384
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:40,627
I reckon the boy's got some Cosmo.
Doesn't mean he's a knight yet.

385
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:42,629
I don't need cold comfort, Nero.

386
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:45,382
I need to know where on Earth
Alman is hiding the girl.

387
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,010
So we can neutralize her
before she becomes Athena

388
00:32:48,093 --> 00:32:49,469
and destroys the world.

389
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:52,097
Beats me.

390
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,976
But you could always ask our prisoner.

391
00:32:59,021 --> 00:33:00,189
We have a prisoner?

392
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:37,559
Hey!

393
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:39,561
Hey, wait up.

394
00:33:40,312 --> 00:33:41,355
Yeah?

395
00:33:42,606 --> 00:33:46,401
I... I just figured you could focus more
on your training if you weren't

396
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:48,987
worried about where your next meal
was coming from.

397
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:51,490
Thanks.

398
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:00,290
Thank you.

399
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:02,793
I guess.

400
00:34:05,671 --> 00:34:06,672
Seiya!

401
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:08,715
Time to go.

402
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:12,553
See you.

403
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:16,764
Take a seat.

404
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:23,313
Don't get any big ideas.

405
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:27,609
Goddesses don't have boyfriends.

406
00:34:27,693 --> 00:34:29,570
-How many dads does Sienna have?
-Buckle up.

407
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:40,914
Lunchbox?

408
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,501
That's unusually kind of you.

409
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,964
I just thought
he might as well enjoy his last meal,

410
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:51,257
since Marin's probably
gonna kill him anyway.

411
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,760
Right.

412
00:35:16,533 --> 00:35:18,452
So where am I supposed to go?

413
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,127
Okay. Just drop me off up there.

414
00:35:27,211 --> 00:35:28,712
Not how it works.

415
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:51,527
"Those who seek the master
must do so on foot."

416
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:23,392
What the hell am I doing here?

417
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:26,311
I was wondering the same thing.

418
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:41,910
You must be Marin.

419
00:36:42,744 --> 00:36:44,872
-The Silver Knight.
-You look surprised.

420
00:36:44,955 --> 00:36:47,249
Yeah. No, I'm... I mean...

421
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,252
No offense, I thought you'd be a man.

422
00:36:50,335 --> 00:36:51,795
No offense taken.

423
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,422
I thought the same of you.

424
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:57,134
What's the training schedule like here?

425
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,344
I only train knights.

426
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,390
I'm told I'm the Pegasus Knight.

427
00:37:05,142 --> 00:37:08,187
You're not the first boy
with a pretty necklace to show up here.

428
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,064
Is there a test I can take or something?

429
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:17,654
The Pegasus Knight is brave.

430
00:37:20,616 --> 00:37:21,450
Check.

431
00:37:22,201 --> 00:37:23,285
Humble.

432
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:24,536
Check.

433
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:27,706
And committed
to protecting Athena with his life.

434
00:37:28,624 --> 00:37:32,252
Okay, that's where this whole situation
gets a little sticky.

435
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:33,795
See, I lost my sister-- Hey!

436
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:36,673
I just got up here!

437
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:40,928
I just got up here.

438
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:45,807
I'm not going down there.

439
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:18,590
There's nothing for you here.

440
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:20,676
What are you? Like, a ninja?

441
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:26,807
Listen, I only wanna find my sister.
Sienna said you could help.

442
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,351
I knew a knight just like you.

443
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:31,353
He desired power for his own goals.

444
00:38:31,436 --> 00:38:33,438
-Which was?
-The Phoenix.

445
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:35,607
The most powerful of Athena's knights.

446
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:37,734
You mean, aside from the Pegasus Knight.

447
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:42,030
I'll have Mylock come get you
in the morning.

448
00:38:42,114 --> 00:38:43,782
No. Come on, I made it this far.

449
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:45,200
And how far is that?

450
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:47,828
Do you even know how far you need to go?

451
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:50,163
Just give me one chance.

452
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:57,754
If you can break this rock...

453
00:38:58,881 --> 00:39:01,008
then you can be my student.

454
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:10,767
Fair enough.

455
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:12,936
Where's the hammer?

456
00:39:15,856 --> 00:39:17,983
Come on, I can't break a rock
with my bare hands.

457
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:19,902
A knight could.

458
00:39:21,862 --> 00:39:23,238
You can't be serious.

459
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:28,410
You're serious.

460
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:45,886
I told you, this was stupid!

461
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:53,894
Your flesh, this rock,
the stars in the sky,

462
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:57,940
all things in the cosmos are made
from the same atoms.

463
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:02,277
From the moment we are born,
we all hold a Cosmo within ourselves.

464
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:05,113
A knight can make it explode.

465
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:09,701
And shatter the atoms of any object.

466
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:16,708
How's that supposed to make any sense?

467
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:21,380
Focus.

468
00:40:23,215 --> 00:40:24,633
Clear your mind.

469
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:27,261
Feel the Cosmo within you.

470
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:04,006
<i>Seiya!</i>

471
00:41:08,051 --> 00:41:09,803
This is stupid, it'll never work!

472
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:11,847
Something clouded your focus
at the last minute.

473
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,641
Figures. Guess I'm not
the Pegasus Knight after all.

474
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:16,727
No, you're not.

475
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:18,979
But maybe you will be.

476
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,982
Are you ready to start your training?

477
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:41,877
It's a good thing he didn't mind
the permanent changes to his body.

478
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,213
-Well...
-What?

479
00:41:44,296 --> 00:41:47,299
I might have forgotten to mention
the permanent part to him.

480
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:00,771
What the hell is this?

481
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,523
What did you do? You made--

482
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,817
You made me a freaking cyborg!

483
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:17,663
What is that?

484
00:42:17,746 --> 00:42:19,248
It's the curse of Athena.

485
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:24,127
The war that awaits us is unlike
any other before.

486
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,381
Our enemies are the gods themselves.

487
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,425
We've all made sacrifices.

488
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:37,224
But what is flesh in comparison
to the power to crush the immortals?

489
00:42:42,354 --> 00:42:44,064
A war with the gods, huh?

490
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:46,525
There's only one person I wanna crush.

491
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:51,697
Well, that was a nice little show.

492
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,074
Let's move on.
We have bigger issues at hand.

493
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:55,784
-Bigger than his ego?
-Your prisoner.

494
00:42:55,868 --> 00:42:58,370
He's a tough one. I can't get him to talk.

495
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:01,290
-Any ideas?
-Have you tried asking nicely?

496
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:10,382
Let's get a baseline.

497
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:23,979
Show me what you know.

498
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:26,481
You mean, fight you? Now?

499
00:43:32,988 --> 00:43:34,531
You came here to train, yes?

500
00:43:39,953 --> 00:43:42,206
Is dancing all you can do?

501
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:13,070
Shouldn't I have a weapon or something?

502
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:14,988
Athena's knights wield no weapon.

503
00:44:15,656 --> 00:44:16,698
That sucks.

504
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:46,854
Okay, I felt that one.

505
00:44:46,937 --> 00:44:48,605
It wasn't a direct hit.

506
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:57,489
How the hell'd you do that?

507
00:44:57,573 --> 00:44:59,199
You want a weapon?

508
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:01,285
Your Cosmo is your weapon.

509
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,161
Focus your energy,

510
00:45:03,245 --> 00:45:05,372
let it burn inside of you.

511
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:07,332
Release it all at once.

512
00:45:07,416 --> 00:45:08,458
Like a shooting star.

513
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:11,170
Felt more like a meteor shower to me.

514
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:19,761
So do I get to learn
this meteor fist of yours?

515
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:20,846
You must...

516
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:24,099
if you want to survive
the battles that await you.

517
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:32,543
Sienna!

518
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:38,841
It's all right. It's all right.

519
00:46:38,924 --> 00:46:40,509
It's all right. It's all right.

520
00:46:40,592 --> 00:46:42,219
I'm here. It's all right.

521
00:46:44,638 --> 00:46:47,516
I had another vision. Bad one.

522
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:50,185
It's okay, it's all gone now.

523
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:51,645
Dad...

524
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:56,275
How can you be so sure
I'll grow up to protect the world?

525
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:58,735
You are the goddess of wisdom, remember?

526
00:46:58,819 --> 00:46:59,862
And warfare.

527
00:47:01,655 --> 00:47:03,156
And you're my baby girl.

528
00:47:03,866 --> 00:47:06,201
The most loving and stubborn.

529
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:08,996
Nothing could stop you
from doing what's right.

530
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:10,539
What did you see?

531
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:15,002
People... burning.

532
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:16,837
Cities in ruins.

533
00:47:17,588 --> 00:47:19,047
Everything...

534
00:47:20,424 --> 00:47:21,717
destroyed.

535
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,802
We won't let that happen, will we?

536
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:26,013
You don't understand. It was Athena.

537
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:27,681
She was doing it. I...

538
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:30,184
I was doing it.

539
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:34,479
Visions are just... possibilities.

540
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:37,399
Dad, I know you'd let
the world burn to keep me safe...

541
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,278
but what if that's not me anymore?

542
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:58,170
Prove to me you're worthy. Focus.

543
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:03,842
Is that all you've got?

544
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:07,221
Your body is here.

545
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:09,973
But your mind is elsewhere.

546
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:19,399
<i>Seiya.</i>

547
00:48:19,483 --> 00:48:21,610
There's so many things I need to tell you.

548
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:23,362
I'm here to protect you.

549
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:26,490
Now stop my attack.

550
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,542
You're failing.

551
00:48:40,379 --> 00:48:41,797
Was he a knight too?

552
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,257
The Pegasus?

553
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:47,511
Mind and body must become one.

554
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:53,725
A knight's power comes from within.

555
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,280
You give up?

556
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:13,161
If you can't do this,
you'll never be a knight.

557
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:25,799
You give up?

558
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:12,888
How did you say you ended up here, again?

559
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:15,724
I didn't say. And it's none of your--

560
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:17,935
Right, I'm not supposed to know. I know.

561
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:23,148
My destiny is bound to this island.

562
00:50:23,982 --> 00:50:26,026
Well, that sounds like a lonely existence.

563
00:50:26,109 --> 00:50:27,819
But not one without purpose.

564
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:29,488
You know, I...

565
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:32,074
I have a purpose too.

566
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:33,700
To find my sister.

567
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:37,162
A knight should not mistake
obsession for purpose.

568
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:39,957
I know there is pain in your past...

569
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:43,836
but beyond that pain,
there lies your strength.

570
00:50:44,503 --> 00:50:47,756
Find it and the armor will accept you.

571
00:50:48,757 --> 00:50:50,759
This is what your sister would've wanted.

572
00:50:52,636 --> 00:50:53,804
Get some sleep.

573
00:52:44,498 --> 00:52:46,375
I get it.

574
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:48,293
You're tough.

575
00:52:49,044 --> 00:52:53,048
You know, someone once taught me

576
00:52:53,131 --> 00:52:56,009
that all men, no matter how tough,

577
00:52:57,386 --> 00:52:58,887
have something they fear.

578
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:09,648
I wonder what it is
a big man like you fears the most.

579
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:30,085
Who are you?

580
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:38,010
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

581
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:42,014
Make it stop.

582
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:47,352
Make it stop!

583
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:49,229
Make it go away.

584
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:51,481
Now...

585
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:55,986
would you mind telling me
where I can find Alman Kido?

586
00:53:57,237 --> 00:53:58,614
Make it stop!

587
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:09,041
-This one's bigger than the last one.
-And your Cosmo is stronger.

588
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:11,084
Now, show me what you've learned.

589
00:55:38,964 --> 00:55:40,048
You did it, Seiya.

590
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:43,093
The Pegasus armor is--

591
00:55:56,773 --> 00:55:59,985
You can't use it. Only the Pegasus can.

592
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:01,778
That's why you're coming with us.

593
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:13,916
Alman.

594
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:16,710
He was a part of it.

595
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:21,548
He was there when Guraad took Patricia.

596
00:56:26,136 --> 00:56:27,804
I want off this island.

597
00:56:30,682 --> 00:56:31,934
You are not ready.

598
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:33,936
Your training is not over.

599
00:56:35,312 --> 00:56:36,480
It is now.

600
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:49,368
Alman's been playing me for a fool!

601
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:50,994
You must calm down.

602
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:54,122
If your heart and mind aren't clear,
the armor will reject you.

603
00:56:54,206 --> 00:56:55,707
To hell with the armor!

604
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:27,865
Seiya.

605
00:57:29,116 --> 00:57:30,325
I don't care.

606
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:33,662
You can either kill me now...

607
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,833
or send me back.

608
00:57:44,131 --> 00:57:45,966
Let's go. One more round, guys.

609
00:57:47,009 --> 00:57:48,010
Come on.

610
00:57:55,726 --> 00:57:57,060
How's it coming along?

611
00:57:59,938 --> 00:58:02,232
You want this to work, I need more time.

612
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:05,819
Be careful, you idiot!

613
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:15,370
Yeah, running out of sparring partners.
You care to join?

614
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:17,331
Oh, I'm sorry. Busy day.

615
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:23,504
Right, right. You're playing
with your god-killing toy over here.

616
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:25,839
Yeah.

617
00:58:27,257 --> 00:58:29,551
So much trouble for one little girl.

618
00:58:29,635 --> 00:58:31,261
You know, if you ask me,

619
00:58:31,345 --> 00:58:34,973
I'd be more than happy to snap her neck
the old-fashioned way.

620
00:58:37,226 --> 00:58:42,147
Any damage to Sienna's body
might awaken Athena's Cosmo within her.

621
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:44,900
Yeah, I don't even know what that means.

622
00:58:45,526 --> 00:58:49,571
It means you can't dismantle
a nuclear bomb by smashing it with a club.

623
00:58:50,822 --> 00:58:52,282
I'd sure love to try.

624
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:54,993
It's not happening.

625
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:57,621
Make it work.

626
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,548
Alman!

627
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:09,091
I know what you did!

628
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:12,886
-Come face me, you coward.
-Stand down!

629
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,013
I'll handle this.

630
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:17,474
-Seiya, please.
-Alman!

631
00:59:18,183 --> 00:59:19,560
Please calm down.

632
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:20,853
Stand back!

633
00:59:21,854 --> 00:59:23,438
You can't hide from me.

634
00:59:24,147 --> 00:59:25,148
Seiya!

635
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:28,485
He took Patricia. He was in on it.

636
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:29,903
There's more to it than that.

637
00:59:29,987 --> 00:59:32,531
No! No, you don't wanna do that.

638
00:59:32,614 --> 00:59:34,116
You don't understand.

639
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:37,786
Come with me. I'll tell you
what really happened to your sister.

640
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:45,169
Sienna, you know the rules.

641
00:59:46,503 --> 00:59:50,632
You must not leave the mansion grounds.

642
01:00:23,207 --> 01:00:24,499
You said you have answers.

643
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:26,043
Hey!

644
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,631
Alman was there when Guraad took Patricia.
He was a part of it.

645
01:00:30,714 --> 01:00:32,466
Tell me I'm wrong.

646
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:34,551
He did it because of me.

647
01:00:39,181 --> 01:00:41,975
When I was younger,
I had no control at all.

648
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:45,312
One night, my mom was holding me
and I had a burst of Cosmo.

649
01:00:45,395 --> 01:00:46,855
I don't even know how it happened.

650
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:50,901
All I remember is she was holding me
and I destroyed her arms.

651
01:00:50,984 --> 01:00:53,779
And the next moment,
she was dying and it was all my fault.

652
01:00:53,862 --> 01:00:56,532
Alman used the power
of the gold armor to save her,

653
01:00:56,615 --> 01:00:59,910
but ever since the accident,
Guraad needs Cosmo to stay alive.

654
01:00:59,993 --> 01:01:02,079
So what? You've got plenty of it.

655
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:04,873
Athena's Cosmo's too powerful.
It would kill her.

656
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:08,085
That's why she sought out kids
like your sister.

657
01:01:08,168 --> 01:01:09,586
What did she do to Pat?

658
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,713
Your sister didn't have any Cosmo.

659
01:01:11,797 --> 01:01:14,258
Once Guraad figured that out,
she let her go.

660
01:01:14,925 --> 01:01:16,677
But she sent her men to watch her.

661
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:19,096
Guraad knew Patricia was hiding something.

662
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:21,265
Me.

663
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,435
That's why she never came back.

664
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:28,480
Look, I'm sorry, Seiya. If I knew, I...

665
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:35,487
My mother was never the same
after the incident.

666
01:01:35,571 --> 01:01:39,825
She became convinced that Athena
had returned to this world to end it.

667
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:43,370
She was gonna kill me,
so my father forced me into hiding.

668
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:44,830
And left Pat behind.

669
01:01:46,915 --> 01:01:48,834
Your sister wasn't the only one.

670
01:01:50,752 --> 01:01:52,212
We left them all behind.

671
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:56,717
How many kids did your family take?

672
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:06,810
Our radar picked up Guraad's signature.

673
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:12,566
So it is happening.

674
01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:14,860
We don't stand a chance.

675
01:02:14,943 --> 01:02:19,448
You need to get out of here.
I'll buy you as much time as I can.

676
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:21,241
I'm not running from a fight.

677
01:02:21,742 --> 01:02:23,243
Find Sienna.

678
01:02:24,286 --> 01:02:25,287
Protect her.

679
01:02:26,371 --> 01:02:28,498
You're the only one I can trust.

680
01:02:35,923 --> 01:02:37,132
And, Mylock?

681
01:02:38,842 --> 01:02:40,511
You've been a good friend.

682
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:43,722
Thank you.

683
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:54,191
After Pat was taken, I ran away.

684
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,153
All these years,
I've never stopped looking for her.

685
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:02,741
Turns out she was the one
who was keeping away from me.

686
01:03:03,408 --> 01:03:04,993
Your sister sacrificed herself

687
01:03:05,077 --> 01:03:06,912
because she believed
in what you really are.

688
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:08,705
I never asked to be a knight.

689
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:13,043
I only wanted to be with Pat.

690
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:16,797
You think I wanted any of this?

691
01:03:18,382 --> 01:03:22,052
Sometimes I feel like
I'm a guest in my own body.

692
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:26,598
In time,
I thought I'd learn to control it.

693
01:03:27,432 --> 01:03:28,851
But you're fighting it.

694
01:03:31,812 --> 01:03:33,480
What if my mother was right?

695
01:03:37,526 --> 01:03:41,947
What if I was only born
to bring ruin and misery into this world?

696
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:43,824
That's not who you are.

697
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:48,579
How do you know?

698
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:52,499
I guess I just know.

699
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,550
I need you to promise me...

700
01:04:02,467 --> 01:04:03,927
if things go wrong...

701
01:04:04,803 --> 01:04:08,515
if, in the end, I become a goddess of war
and I can't control my powers...

702
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:14,313
you will stop me, at all costs.

703
01:04:15,022 --> 01:04:17,774
-You don't mean--
-Just promise me, please.

704
01:04:21,612 --> 01:04:23,197
That's my mother.

705
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:29,328
Sienna, wait, you can't go back!

706
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:32,623
-You're the one she's after.
-I have to help my father.

707
01:04:33,999 --> 01:04:35,000
Okay.

708
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,002
I'm with you.

709
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,921
For now.

710
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:13,622
Shut it! Shut it!

711
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:17,251
Hold.

712
01:05:29,555 --> 01:05:30,514
Don't let them through!

713
01:05:46,864 --> 01:05:47,823
No! No--!

714
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:02,171
It's clear.

715
01:06:26,403 --> 01:06:27,404
Where's Seiya?

716
01:06:28,322 --> 01:06:29,406
And whatever her name is?

717
01:06:29,489 --> 01:06:33,285
Sienna is not here,
but I am willing to make a deal.

718
01:06:33,368 --> 01:06:35,913
Old man, you are in no position
to be making deals.

719
01:06:35,996 --> 01:06:37,873
Wait outside, Cassios.

720
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,626
-Are you serious?
-Out!

721
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:49,259
Hey!

722
01:06:54,473 --> 01:06:56,517
I really need to get to this ship.

723
01:07:12,074 --> 01:07:13,575
Glad you understand.

724
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:25,629
How do you like my special bullets?

725
01:07:31,218 --> 01:07:32,886
Let's make this easy, shall we?

726
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:34,763
Just tell me where she is.

727
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,559
Straight to business, then.

728
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:40,811
What do you expect,
after she almost killed me?

729
01:07:40,894 --> 01:07:43,105
That was an accident and you know it.

730
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:44,648
You can't blame Sienna for it.

731
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:46,650
Oh, I never blamed Sienna.

732
01:07:46,733 --> 01:07:48,151
I blamed you, Alman,

733
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:50,863
for leaving me
to make all the hard choices.

734
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:53,949
How is murdering a little girl
even a choice?

735
01:07:54,032 --> 01:07:56,994
She's a sword of Damocles
hanging over all of us.

736
01:07:57,077 --> 01:07:59,746
-She's your daughter.
-We never had a daughter!

737
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:04,126
What we had was an agreement, remember?

738
01:08:04,209 --> 01:08:07,796
That when she'd go out of control,
we'd do whatever had to be done together.

739
01:08:07,880 --> 01:08:11,049
Sienna was entrusted to me.

740
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:15,220
I'm responsible for her.

741
01:08:15,804 --> 01:08:17,096
I believe in her.

742
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:19,474
You must believe in our child too.

743
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:28,524
What about all the children
you took to make these?

744
01:08:31,486 --> 01:08:33,238
Weren't you responsible for them?

745
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:35,866
It was the only way to save you.

746
01:08:35,948 --> 01:08:38,160
And now I must save
the rest of us from her.

747
01:08:48,629 --> 01:08:50,046
Speaking of the devil.

748
01:08:57,345 --> 01:08:58,430
Dad?

749
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:12,861
I didn't want to do this,
but I won't let you hurt her.

750
01:09:12,944 --> 01:09:14,279
I know.

751
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:15,447
Cassios!

752
01:09:24,747 --> 01:09:25,749
Enough!

753
01:09:27,917 --> 01:09:30,546
Get me the girl.
You can do what you want with the boy.

754
01:09:46,728 --> 01:09:48,104
Seiya!

755
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:54,486
We need to go.

756
01:09:56,989 --> 01:09:59,908
Hey there. I'm gonna take the girl now.

757
01:10:00,826 --> 01:10:02,286
But first, I want you.

758
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:03,620
Let's end this now.

759
01:10:03,704 --> 01:10:05,122
-No, Seiya. Don't.
-It's okay.

760
01:10:06,456 --> 01:10:07,583
I've got the armor.

761
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:13,797
Any time now.

762
01:10:16,592 --> 01:10:18,385
Sienna, stay back!

763
01:10:44,036 --> 01:10:45,829
Things have changed, kid.

764
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:48,165
Face it, you don't have what it takes.

765
01:11:57,276 --> 01:11:59,278
I loved these glasses.

766
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:45,365
Stop! Stop!

767
01:12:46,491 --> 01:12:49,036
You've won.
I'm coming with you. Let him go.

768
01:12:51,121 --> 01:12:53,081
You're coming with me anyway.

769
01:13:12,976 --> 01:13:14,645
Rescue on the way, kids.

770
01:13:34,665 --> 01:13:35,666
I'm sorry,

771
01:13:35,749 --> 01:13:38,627
but I'm taking you down with me.

772
01:13:43,090 --> 01:13:44,466
Go! Go! Go!

773
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:41,064
No.

774
01:15:12,429 --> 01:15:13,430
It's ready.

775
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:17,851
Give me a minute.

776
01:15:22,022 --> 01:15:23,023
Leave.

777
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:50,759
You must think
I'm the worst mother in the world.

778
01:15:51,426 --> 01:15:54,221
You... You killed Father.

779
01:15:55,389 --> 01:15:56,974
Alman chose his own way,

780
01:15:57,057 --> 01:16:00,269
and left me
to clean up his mess, as always.

781
01:16:09,486 --> 01:16:11,280
Athena's Cosmo is too strong.

782
01:16:12,072 --> 01:16:13,866
It won't fix you.

783
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:14,783
I know.

784
01:16:16,952 --> 01:16:20,622
Yeah. I gave up
on fixing this body a long time ago.

785
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:29,173
We both have a bomb ticking inside.

786
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:35,721
Except yours is gonna be so much louder
if we let it go off.

787
01:16:44,271 --> 01:16:46,231
I know I'm doing the right thing.

788
01:16:52,237 --> 01:16:55,532
I just wanted you to know
it doesn't make it any easier.

789
01:17:09,546 --> 01:17:10,797
Will it hurt much?

790
01:17:13,592 --> 01:17:14,593
I don't know.

791
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:38,909
We need to start.

792
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:47,084
Do it.

793
01:18:33,839 --> 01:18:34,882
Sienna...

794
01:18:46,310 --> 01:18:48,103
That ain't gonna help, kiddo.

795
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:51,565
I let her get taken.

796
01:18:52,816 --> 01:18:53,817
I failed.

797
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:57,779
We all did.

798
01:18:58,363 --> 01:18:59,990
I was supposed to protect her.

799
01:19:00,073 --> 01:19:02,910
Things don't always work out
the way we expect them to.

800
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:14,880
Come on, Seiya.

801
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:38,737
Marin.

802
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:43,408
You were right about me.

803
01:19:45,369 --> 01:19:46,370
I failed.

804
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,208
I'm not a knight.

805
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:54,545
I couldn't save her.

806
01:19:55,712 --> 01:20:00,551
A knight should not mistake
obsession for purpose.

807
01:20:06,723 --> 01:20:09,059
Seiya, focus.

808
01:20:09,977 --> 01:20:12,020
Who is it that you're trying to save?

809
01:20:19,486 --> 01:20:20,320
Pat.

810
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:27,286
What does this...?

811
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:30,289
<i>Who are you really trying to save?</i>

812
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:56,315
I'm sorry.

813
01:20:57,316 --> 01:20:59,067
I'm so sorry.

814
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:14,458
I know.

815
01:21:16,752 --> 01:21:17,794
It's okay.

816
01:21:20,714 --> 01:21:22,007
It wasn't your fault.

817
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:24,801
Okay.

818
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:45,614
I'll bring her back.

819
01:21:54,623 --> 01:21:55,749
I promise.

820
01:21:56,458 --> 01:21:57,501
Okay.

821
01:22:07,636 --> 01:22:09,346
Let's go get Sienna back.

822
01:22:28,323 --> 01:22:29,658
How long will it take?

823
01:22:30,284 --> 01:22:33,495
To kill a god? Good question.

824
01:22:33,579 --> 01:22:34,997
We're about to find out.

825
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:06,612
Oh, boy. They got us on radar.

826
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:08,113
-What?
-Get ready.

827
01:23:08,197 --> 01:23:09,198
For what?

828
01:23:09,781 --> 01:23:12,951
I can get you close, but I can't land.

829
01:23:14,286 --> 01:23:15,329
Parachute?

830
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:19,708
Who says you're not funny?

831
01:23:21,418 --> 01:23:23,086
It's now or never!

832
01:23:26,048 --> 01:23:27,049
Open the doors.

833
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,937
Get yourself out of here!

834
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:42,523
Godspeed, kiddo.

835
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:18,911
-Out of the way.
-Hey!

836
01:25:20,037 --> 01:25:21,288
He's mine.

837
01:25:23,624 --> 01:25:25,834
Big deal. You know how to glow.

838
01:25:25,918 --> 01:25:28,837
Step aside, Cassios,
if you don't wanna get hurt.

839
01:25:28,921 --> 01:25:29,755
Hurt?

840
01:25:31,423 --> 01:25:33,926
You should've died
when you had the chance.

841
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:53,028
What was it that you said, Cassios?

842
01:25:55,155 --> 01:25:56,156
Right.

843
01:26:00,244 --> 01:26:01,078
Oh, no.

844
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:02,955
Things have changed.

845
01:26:10,504 --> 01:26:13,674
Finally,
the goddess Athena reveals herself.

846
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:22,099
<i>You must believe in our child too.</i>

847
01:26:27,688 --> 01:26:30,190
Stop! Stop the procedure!

848
01:26:30,274 --> 01:26:32,234
It'll be over soon.

849
01:26:32,317 --> 01:26:33,569
Now!

850
01:26:34,403 --> 01:26:36,321
We are not stopping!

851
01:26:36,405 --> 01:26:37,990
Get out of my way.

852
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:40,868
Guards!

853
01:26:44,872 --> 01:26:47,249
Your services are no longer required.

854
01:26:47,332 --> 01:26:48,959
There's no stopping it now.

855
01:26:49,042 --> 01:26:52,045
In moments,
she'll be nothing but a memory.

856
01:26:55,048 --> 01:26:56,133
Kill him!

857
01:27:59,863 --> 01:28:01,782
You said it yourself, Guraad.

858
01:28:02,491 --> 01:28:06,870
When one goes to war with the gods,
sacrifices must be made.

859
01:28:08,789 --> 01:28:11,667
There must be another way
to protect humanity.

860
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:13,502
Protect humanity?

861
01:28:14,169 --> 01:28:15,754
Is that what you think you're doing?

862
01:28:35,065 --> 01:28:37,276
Killing Athena was only
half of the battle.

863
01:28:45,826 --> 01:28:47,995
This is the other half.

864
01:28:50,414 --> 01:28:51,790
The gold armor.

865
01:29:05,304 --> 01:29:06,847
Can't let you do that.

866
01:29:06,930 --> 01:29:09,016
Thought you were the only knight in town?

867
01:29:09,641 --> 01:29:11,018
You gotta get out of the way.

868
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:25,384
Sienna!

869
01:30:57,082 --> 01:30:59,168
You're no match for the Phoenix.

870
01:31:10,345 --> 01:31:12,097
Why do you try so hard?

871
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,017
She's not worth it.

872
01:31:15,767 --> 01:31:17,603
She's not even human.

873
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:20,397
Sienna's not a god of war.

874
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:23,108
I don't care what kind of god she is.

875
01:31:23,192 --> 01:31:24,735
Man needs no gods!

876
01:31:59,394 --> 01:32:01,188
You don't know when to quit.

877
01:32:01,271 --> 01:32:02,731
People keep telling me that.

878
01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:46,692
Stop, you fool!

879
01:33:22,436 --> 01:33:23,896
Sienna!

880
01:33:24,521 --> 01:33:26,940
Listen to me!
That's not your friend anymore!

881
01:33:30,527 --> 01:33:32,446
She's become the goddess of war.

882
01:33:32,529 --> 01:33:33,906
We have to stop her!

883
01:34:29,461 --> 01:34:30,671
<i>Seiya.</i>

884
01:34:30,754 --> 01:34:32,089
<i>I'm losing control.</i>

885
01:34:33,841 --> 01:34:36,718
<i>I don't think
I can hold her back much longer.</i>

886
01:34:43,433 --> 01:34:45,477
<i>You can't save me,</i>

887
01:34:45,561 --> 01:34:47,980
<i>but you can stop Athena.</i>

888
01:34:49,898 --> 01:34:51,400
<i>You must do it now.</i>

889
01:34:52,234 --> 01:34:53,652
<i>At all costs.</i>

890
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:50,334
Sienna...

891
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:53,295
you're not a goddess of war.

892
01:35:55,130 --> 01:35:56,798
No one's destiny...

893
01:35:57,758 --> 01:35:59,259
is written in stone.

894
01:36:02,221 --> 01:36:03,388
Not even yours.

895
01:36:10,771 --> 01:36:12,564
The guardian of mankind...

896
01:36:13,398 --> 01:36:15,067
or a petulant jerk...

897
01:36:17,819 --> 01:36:21,323
whatever you choose to be,
I'll never give up on you.

898
01:37:22,718 --> 01:37:23,719
Seiya.

899
01:37:33,478 --> 01:37:34,730
What? Why?

900
01:37:35,314 --> 01:37:37,983
-What was that for?
-Who's the petulant jerk?

901
01:37:38,650 --> 01:37:39,693
Oh, my...

902
01:37:40,777 --> 01:37:41,945
Okay.

903
01:37:43,739 --> 01:37:45,073
-Get up.
-Okay.

904
01:37:51,622 --> 01:37:53,040
Let's get out of here.

905
01:37:55,417 --> 01:37:56,418
Wait.

906
01:38:26,031 --> 01:38:27,074
I'm sorry.

907
01:38:28,283 --> 01:38:29,785
I was wrong about you.

908
01:38:31,203 --> 01:38:34,414
I wasn't so sure myself
for a very long time.

909
01:39:20,169 --> 01:39:21,795
You didn't have to do that.

910
01:39:24,089 --> 01:39:25,132
Yes, I did.

911
01:39:44,693 --> 01:39:46,028
Did I do this?

912
01:39:52,534 --> 01:39:53,535
Mylock!

913
01:39:54,077 --> 01:39:55,204
Sienna!

914
01:39:58,707 --> 01:39:59,708
Are you okay?

915
01:40:00,334 --> 01:40:01,335
I'm okay.

916
01:40:11,553 --> 01:40:12,888
Glad you made it, Seiya.

917
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:15,182
You too.

918
01:41:01,103 --> 01:41:02,521
So, boss...

919
01:41:04,189 --> 01:41:05,524
what do we do now?

920
01:41:07,734 --> 01:41:11,613
Athena's awakening is a sign the old gods
will soon return and try to start a war.

921
01:41:14,241 --> 01:41:17,035
We need to gather all the Knights
of the Zodiac to stop them.

922
01:41:21,206 --> 01:41:24,209
I'm at your service, my lord.

923
01:41:28,005 --> 01:41:29,840
Stop. Don't call me that.

924
01:41:29,923 --> 01:41:31,341
Whatever you say, princess.

925
01:41:32,593 --> 01:41:34,469
No. And definitely not that.

926
01:41:42,603 --> 01:41:45,105
Before we gather the knights,
there's something else we need to do.

927
01:41:46,106 --> 01:41:47,107
What's that?

928
01:41:50,027 --> 01:41:51,945
It's time to find Patricia.

929
01:41:57,117 --> 01:41:58,118
Thank you.

930
01:41:59,620 --> 01:42:01,288
It's the least a goddess could do.
