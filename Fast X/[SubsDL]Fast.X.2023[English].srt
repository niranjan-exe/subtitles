1
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:58,292
There is nothing a father
wouldn't do for his son.

2
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:01,094
Your mother
never understood this.

3
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,698
She looked at you
and saw a monster.

4
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,833
I saw potential.

5
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:09,436
When a bully took your money,
you took his eye.

6
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:13,140
When they called you crazy,
you took their tongues.

7
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,643
But I brought you here today.

8
00:01:15,677 --> 00:01:17,411
Was it generosity?

9
00:01:17,444 --> 00:01:19,479
Love?

10
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:20,748
No.

11
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:23,450
It's so what I built
doesn't die with me.

12
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:25,285
So my legacy can live on,

13
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,422
because a father and his son
is everything.

14
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,825
I have a job that I can
only trust with one man.

15
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,459
You.

16
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,395
My most ruthless soldiers
were watching our cash houses,

17
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,600
and they let this Dominic
Toretto burn what is mine.

18
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,367
I'll kill Dominic Toretto.

19
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:42,737
I'll kill 'em all.

20
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,439
Kill them?
You'd show them mercy?

21
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:46,608
No, my son.

22
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:51,278
When suffering is owed,
never accept death as a payment.

23
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:56,584
Make Toretto suffer.

24
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:15,703
Now the work begins.

25
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:17,505
And in there,

26
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:21,375
today we'll put our family
on a path to real power.

27
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,512
Let's get started.

28
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:18,391
Shit!

29
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:49,322
Hey, there's too many of them!

30
00:04:49,356 --> 00:04:50,958
-We're not gonna make it.
-You're right. We aren't.

31
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,060
-You are.
-No, I'm not leaving you.

32
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:54,929
Now, you stick with the plan.

33
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,697
It was always the plan.

34
00:05:47,982 --> 00:05:49,449
Get him.

35
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:15,069
You had it.

36
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,204
I didn't have it.

37
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:19,807
B, no one starts
at the finish line.

38
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,943
You got to have faith.

39
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:23,678
Remember today's lesson.

40
00:07:23,711 --> 00:07:26,213
Find the line,

41
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:28,215
feel the car,

42
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,717
and let it fly.

43
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,819
It's okay to be afraid.

44
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,021
Sometimes fear can be
the best teacher.

45
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:35,690
I wasn't scared.

46
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,592
-Everyone gets scared, son.
-You don't.

47
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:40,561
You're not afraid of anything.

48
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,565
We better hurry.

49
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,233
Great-Grandma just flew in.

50
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,736
And she's making
her famous maduros.

51
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:51,572
We got to get to those
before Uncle Roman does.

52
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,007
Now, that's something
to be afraid of.

53
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:12,526
<i>You have been dead.</i>

54
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,128
<i>-It's time to get you living.</i>
<i>-Told you guys,</i>

55
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,129
<i>I don't need that.</i>

56
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:18,065
There, profile done.

57
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:19,633
You're welcome.

58
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,002
Now, you give it
about three, four days...

59
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:22,269
It never happens instantly.

60
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:24,071
-Wait, what?
-Hmm.

61
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,539
Wow.

62
00:08:25,573 --> 00:08:26,807
Let me see
your profile picture again.

63
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,009
He must have
put a filter on there.

64
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,744
What are you guys looking at?

65
00:08:29,777 --> 00:08:31,145
-Oh, wait. No, no, no, no.
-They're just video games, man.

66
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,546
-H-H-Hold on, man.
-Just videos, man.

67
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,714
Can I sit next to you?

68
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:34,648
-Boy nosy.
-You drifting yet?

69
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:35,850
I am.

70
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:38,919
You should've seen us.
It was so cool, Mom.

71
00:08:38,953 --> 00:08:40,221
Hey!

72
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,222
¡Oye, familia!

73
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:42,823
I am starving!

74
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:44,592
Come on.

75
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,728
I also want a hug from
every single person in--

76
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:49,030
Oh.

77
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:50,698
-Ah.
-You see the line?

78
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,299
We're all waiting in line
for this love, abuelita.

79
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,568
-Oh, yeah.
-Wait till you taste this.

80
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:55,636
It's really good.

81
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,304
I put myself out for this one.

82
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:58,906
Oh.

83
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,744
Okay, everybody pipe down,
please.

84
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:05,713
Abuelita would like
to say something.

85
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:09,250
Piping and downing, please.

86
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:12,653
As I look out
at this wonderful family,

87
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:17,925
I am filled with so much pride.

88
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,295
The kind of pride that my son--
your father--

89
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,197
would have enjoyed
if he were here.

90
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,134
I know that this road
has been very hard

91
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:29,970
and also not fair.

92
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,374
And yet here you are,

93
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:36,077
despite all of the odds,

94
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,312
building this magnificent

95
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,347
leg...

96
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,991
It is a legacy that will go on
for generations.

97
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,359
No one can take it away.

98
00:09:52,393 --> 00:09:54,295
Not now.

99
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:55,863
Not ever.

100
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,933
Yeah!

101
00:09:58,966 --> 00:09:59,767
To familia.

102
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,970
Familia.

103
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,072
Siempre. Always.

104
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,744
Hey, these new Nikes, man.
Stop playing! Goddamn...

105
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:13,114
Come on, Roman.
The agency put you in charge,

106
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:14,248
and you said I get to drive.

107
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,117
See, what I really need

108
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,184
is I need your brain.

109
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:20,187
Words Roman Pearce
has never said.

110
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,257
So talk me through it again.
I need details.

111
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,993
Yeah, the agency got a tip on
some stolen military hardware.

112
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,129
Tomorrow, a next-gen
quantum computer chip

113
00:10:28,162 --> 00:10:30,297
will be transported
through the streets of Rome,

114
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:31,665
and they need us to steal it.

115
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,400
I checked Roman's intel.

116
00:10:33,434 --> 00:10:34,435
It's legit.

117
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:35,703
Of course it's legit.

118
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:36,971
We're talking 'bout Rome.

119
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,140
Rome. Roman.

120
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:40,708
Come on, man.

121
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,143
That's like planning a heist
in my backyard.

122
00:10:42,176 --> 00:10:44,745
Only thing you know about Rome
is "ro-man" noodles.

123
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,680
One thing
you didn't explain to us is:

124
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:48,048
Why the hell
do we need a RC car,

125
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:51,685
a gold Lamborghini
and 12 tanks of laughing gas?

126
00:10:51,719 --> 00:10:52,987
Yes, I'm in,
'cause you are definitely

127
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,355
going to need
all the brains you can get.

128
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,890
You up to something.

129
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,391
-Hey, Rome...
-Don't talk to me, man.

130
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:58,893
Don't talk to me.

131
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,327
-All right.
-You know what?

132
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:03,797
The disrespect
is gon' have to stop.

133
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,332
Now!

134
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,170
That's just my--
You know what I'm saying?

135
00:11:09,203 --> 00:11:12,473
Me just, you know,
practicing my leadership voice.

136
00:11:12,507 --> 00:11:15,342
I see what's going on.

137
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:17,278
Tej, you think you slick, bro.

138
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,379
Look at you.

139
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:19,880
Spying on me.

140
00:11:19,914 --> 00:11:21,715
What's up with
this old boat anchor?

141
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:22,850
No fuel injection.

142
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,185
I mean, I'd expect
something bigger

143
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:25,419
and better from you, Dom.

144
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,921
Little B and I
are building it together.

145
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,790
The carburetor
forces him to listen.

146
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,192
That's the problem nowadays.

147
00:11:31,225 --> 00:11:32,993
-Nobody listens anymore.
-Well, you better watch out.

148
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:35,829
Little man's gonna be
a better wrench than any of us

149
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:37,064
by the time he's 12.

150
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:38,933
I mean, that's the whole point,
isn't it?

151
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:42,336
Pass it down.

152
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:44,772
Each generation
better than the last.

153
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,208
That's true.

154
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,776
That's fatherhood.

155
00:11:50,044 --> 00:11:52,880
Come a long way from
the two of us popping gas trucks

156
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,949
-in the D.R., huh?
-We sure did.

157
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,519
Those were some tough times.

158
00:11:57,552 --> 00:11:59,920
Those were some great times.

159
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,362
Oh, you...
Y-Y'all was in a meeting?

160
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:10,097
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,832
I-I ain't want
to interrupt y'all.

162
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,400
Han, let's go, man.

163
00:12:13,434 --> 00:12:16,370
Roman asked if he could
lead this mission.

164
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,172
How could I tell him no?

165
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:21,175
But you know I can't let them
go to Rome without you.

166
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,477
Los bandoleros for life.

167
00:12:23,511 --> 00:12:25,779
Lo bandolero for life.

168
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:01,048
You honor his name.

169
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:20,367
Hold us in your heart...

170
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,272
...and you will never
lose your way.

171
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,029
You will be better than me.

172
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,079
What are you looking at?

173
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,251
You.

174
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,991
-Kid's asleep.
-Mm-hmm.

175
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,129
How do you get more beautiful?

176
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,168
Is it here yet?

177
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,070
No.

178
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,508
-It'll come when the time
is right. -Mm.

179
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:50,124
You know, when we were
in the car today...

180
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:56,664
...B said, "Daddy,

181
00:14:56,698 --> 00:14:59,099
you're never afraid."

182
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:01,969
But I am.

183
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,941
I'm afraid of losing a son.

184
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:13,380
Or a wife.

185
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:20,053
That's not gonna happen again.

186
00:15:35,469 --> 00:15:39,440
You can keep your eyes
on that rearview all you want.

187
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,175
But you know what you miss?

188
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:42,510
What?

189
00:15:42,544 --> 00:15:44,044
Eternity

190
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:47,749
in this moment.

191
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:18,513
I'm as surprised as you are.

192
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:25,385
I've imagined killing you
a thousand times.

193
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:29,624
<i>Last time, there was six inches</i>
<i>of reinforced glass,</i>

194
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,626
<i>-guns...</i>
-No!

195
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:32,727
<i>...guards.</i>

196
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,629
<i>I couldn't reach you then.</i>

197
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:36,430
Now I can.

198
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,633
You're gonna want to hear
my last words.

199
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,535
-Dom!
-No!

200
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:51,044
Did you hear Elena's last words

201
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:52,647
before you killed her?

202
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,416
Then don't you think I'd have a
goddamn good reason to be here?

203
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,052
Maybe the only reason
that's ever mattered to you.

204
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,156
Little B.

205
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,660
Wake up, sweetie.

206
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:07,595
We have an unwanted guest.

207
00:17:07,629 --> 00:17:09,162
You know what to do.

208
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,644
What is it that you want?

209
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:24,144
Speak.

210
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:33,555
I met the devil tonight.

211
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:38,158
Honestly, I always thought
it was me.

212
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,427
So that was
kind of disappointing.

213
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:46,333
<i>He came to my door.</i>

214
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:53,340
<i>He let himself in.</i>

215
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:57,311
They say
when you're facing death,

216
00:17:57,344 --> 00:18:00,848
your life flashes
before your eyes.

217
00:18:00,882 --> 00:18:03,083
Are they right?

218
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:09,857
I'd start with who you are.

219
00:18:09,891 --> 00:18:12,225
A question most can't answer
in a lifetime.

220
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,595
You have three seconds.

221
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:18,231
Before you bleed out
on my couch,

222
00:18:18,265 --> 00:18:20,568
you might want to explain
why you're here.

223
00:18:20,602 --> 00:18:23,470
I'm here

224
00:18:23,504 --> 00:18:25,707
because the enemy

225
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,576
of my enemy

226
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,611
is you.

227
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:31,646
<i>I am a man with</i>

228
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,715
no name.

229
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:35,550
Heir to nothing.

230
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,519
And I'm here for
the same reasons you are.

231
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:40,487
Dominic Toretto.

232
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:41,756
You want to kill Dom?

233
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,691
Line's around the block.

234
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:45,526
No, no, no.

235
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,931
Never accept death
when suffering is owed.

236
00:18:49,964 --> 00:18:52,634
But I need your help.

237
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:55,435
Your toys and your tech.

238
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,904
All your boys.

239
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:59,373
'Cause you're either with me
or you're...

240
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:02,209
I don't play well with others.

241
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,911
Then you'll have to watch
who you love most die.

242
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,580
You're looking at
who I love most.

243
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:08,750
You thought you could use
my own move against me?

244
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:10,952
I wasn't talking to you.

245
00:19:10,985 --> 00:19:12,687
I was talking to Zeke.

246
00:19:13,721 --> 00:19:15,690
Amir.

247
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:19,527
Kevin's dad.

248
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:25,332
Who could it be?

249
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:36,443
Cute kids.

250
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:42,617
Ooh.

251
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,556
They all had something to take

252
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:50,825
except that poor bastard.

253
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,894
Not even a kitty cat.

254
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:56,564
The rest of you have a choice.

255
00:19:56,597 --> 00:20:00,367
Me or...

256
00:20:05,338 --> 00:20:08,275
You want to control the world.

257
00:20:09,844 --> 00:20:12,747
I just want to punish it.

258
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,722
I will remember this.

259
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:22,857
I think everyone will.

260
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,862
Huh. I need someone to help me
operate this, don't I?

261
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,731
Nerds?

262
00:20:29,764 --> 00:20:30,965
Come with me.

263
00:20:30,998 --> 00:20:32,466
All right, you know what to do

264
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,367
if you want to see
your families again.

265
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,636
Ciao.

266
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:45,345
Kill her.

267
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:48,850
Shit.

268
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,788
Did you think I would trust you?

269
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,295
It is hard finding good help
these days.

270
00:22:54,775 --> 00:22:56,777
There's a war coming.

271
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:01,649
The sides are being chosen.

272
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:06,888
And everyone you love
will be destroyed.

273
00:23:28,209 --> 00:23:29,844
Lost six pints of blood.

274
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:31,512
Normal person dies at four.

275
00:23:31,545 --> 00:23:32,947
We're shipping her back
to our black site.

276
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,650
-She may not make it.
-But did her story check out?

277
00:23:35,683 --> 00:23:37,184
We confirmed
the shooting downtown,

278
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:38,819
but her tech wasn't there.

279
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:41,522
And whoever took it
now has an electronic arsenal.

280
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:44,558
-You've alerted your people?
-Yeah, Mia and Brian are safe.

281
00:23:44,592 --> 00:23:47,628
I tried to get in touch
with Roman, Tej, Ramsey, Han.

282
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:50,831
-No answer.
-Any idea where they might be?

283
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,902
In Rome.

284
00:23:54,936 --> 00:23:56,704
Working for you.

285
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:59,640
Dom, we don't... we don't have
a mission in Rome.

286
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,209
It's a setup.

287
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:04,245
Shit.

288
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,614
We're going to Rome.

289
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:08,549
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

290
00:24:14,855 --> 00:24:19,459
Son, you and I will finish
that driving lesson.

291
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,530
It's a promise.

292
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:25,700
No matter what happens.

293
00:24:25,733 --> 00:24:28,035
And I always keep my promises.

294
00:24:28,069 --> 00:24:29,904
Head back up.

295
00:24:43,784 --> 00:24:45,853
So can somebody
please help me understand

296
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:48,089
how we're pulling off
a mobile heist

297
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:49,924
but I don't even get to drive?

298
00:24:49,957 --> 00:24:51,926
Well, the sooner we break into
the truck and steal the chip,

299
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:55,529
the sooner you get to live
<i>la dolce vita,</i> okay?

300
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,000
<i>Roman, the convoy's</i>
<i>almost in position.</i>

301
00:24:59,033 --> 00:25:00,568
Where the hell are you at?

302
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:01,869
You're supposed to be
running interference.

303
00:25:01,902 --> 00:25:04,305
<i>Romey-Rome's in the building.</i>

304
00:25:04,338 --> 00:25:06,941
<i>You see me shining, baby.</i>

305
00:25:06,974 --> 00:25:08,609
We on my mission now.

306
00:25:08,642 --> 00:25:10,811
Yeah, we all know
that this is your mission.

307
00:25:10,845 --> 00:25:13,914
'Cause nobody else on Earth
would put Han in an Alfa.

308
00:25:13,948 --> 00:25:16,751
You know, we'd already
be there if Roman wasn't

309
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:18,185
driving Fort Knox on wheels.

310
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:20,988
You know
what's under this hood, baby.

311
00:25:21,022 --> 00:25:22,023
This car is sick.

312
00:25:24,658 --> 00:25:26,327
What this old girl lacks
in horsepower,

313
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,928
she makes up for in agility.

314
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:29,263
Yeah, it's true.

315
00:25:29,296 --> 00:25:31,265
While the Lamborghini has a V-10

316
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:33,067
with a Stage 3
UGR twin-turbo kit,

317
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,070
the Alfa will definitely have an
advantage in this environment.

318
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:38,172
What?

319
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:41,042
Oh, that's right.
I know stuff now.

320
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:43,044
Will you marry me?

321
00:25:43,077 --> 00:25:44,678
That's all it took?

322
00:25:49,083 --> 00:25:50,785
All those agency toys,

323
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:52,653
<i>and you still can't reach Roman?</i>

324
00:25:52,686 --> 00:25:55,056
<i>No cell phone,</i>
<i>emails or text messages.</i>

325
00:25:55,089 --> 00:25:56,724
<i>Nothing's going through.</i>

326
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:59,126
I even tried swiping right
on Han's dating app.

327
00:26:00,828 --> 00:26:02,663
<i>Whoever sent him</i>
<i>on this bogus mission</i>

328
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:05,132
<i>made for damn sure</i>
<i>we couldn't warn them.</i>

329
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,103
Keep searching. They're close.

330
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:10,805
All right, everybody, showtime.

331
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:12,873
Here we go!

332
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:21,348
<i>In position.</i>

333
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:22,950
Cue Tiny Tej.

334

<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>
<i>Hold up. Tiny Tej?</i>

335
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,655
What are you talking about,
Roman?

336
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:29,256
All right, all right,
fire 'em up!

337
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,858
We never agreed on that.

338
00:26:30,891 --> 00:26:33,294
You said you wanted to drive.
Now you driving.

339
00:26:34,895 --> 00:26:36,097
What are you laughing at?
Don't...

340
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,099
<i>Where'd you even get that?</i>

341
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:41,068
Just so you know,
Tiny Tej's brain?

342
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:42,169
Still bigger than yours.

343

<i>This ain't "nun" ya business!</i>

345
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:02,656
It's time to shine!

346
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:30,251
We're in. I have the wheel.

347
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:32,953
We're locked inside!

348
00:27:32,987 --> 00:27:35,322
The truck's being
steered remotely.

349
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:48,936
And a one, and a two, and a...

350
00:27:58,479 --> 00:28:01,715
Holy shit! What happened?!

351
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:04,185
Put a little too much in, huh?
Ready?

352
00:28:13,394 --> 00:28:15,062
That was awesome!

353
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:16,197
Ooh.

354
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,831
<i>Scusi!</i>

355
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,435
They're stealing our truck.

356
00:28:21,468 --> 00:28:23,704
And with us inside.

357
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,943
Just got reports of
two explosions near the Forum.

358
00:28:28,976 --> 00:28:30,444
That's them.

359
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:37,918
Ready? And...

360
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:39,320
Wait, you hear that?

361
00:28:39,353 --> 00:28:41,855
-What the hell is that?!
-I have no idea!

362
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:45,893
Oh, shit.

363
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,194
That's a big-ass bomb!

364
00:28:47,228 --> 00:28:48,996
-What?
-Bomb!

365
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:51,098
Roman, you said
this was carrying chips

366
00:28:51,131 --> 00:28:52,266
for a supercomputer.

367
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:53,801
That is not a chip.
It's a bomb!

368
00:28:54,868 --> 00:28:56,170
What happens if it goes off?

369
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:58,372
What do you mean,
"What happens if it goes off?"

370
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,241
The Seven Hills of Rome
will be down to two and a half!

371
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:03,410
City-wide devastation,
countless lives lost.

372
00:29:03,444 --> 00:29:05,212
You know, the thing bombs do.

373
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:07,114
We're coming to you.

374
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,921
All right, dorks.
What are we blowing up?

375
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:15,022
What?

376
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:16,323
The Vatican?

377
00:29:16,357 --> 00:29:18,125
Wow.

378
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:19,426
Okay. I'll do it.

379
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,362
But you guys are going to hell.

380
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:24,765
<i>That's their truck.</i>

381
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:29,236
Oh, thank God. Dom, Letty.

382
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,405
Ooh. Look who's here.

383
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,540
You're right on time, Dominic.

384
00:29:32,574 --> 00:29:34,375
Turn off the encrypted radio.

385
00:29:36,243 --> 00:29:37,579
Ramsey?

386
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:40,147
We're being remote-controlled.
There's a bomb on board.

387
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,083
It's a DM-79 subnautical
high-yield neutron mine.

388
00:29:45,052 --> 00:29:46,588
Ah! Found it.

389
00:29:46,621 --> 00:29:48,956
I can disarm it
with an agency kill switch.

390
00:29:48,989 --> 00:29:50,991
I just need physical hands
on the device.

391
00:29:51,025 --> 00:29:52,893
-We have to stop that truck.
-Sorry, Captain America.

392
00:29:52,926 --> 00:29:54,395
Can't let you do that.

393
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:59,833
<i>We got to hurry!</i>
<i>The truck is speeding up.</i>

394
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:03,437
-We got to block its path.
-I'm gonna get ahead of it.

395
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,006
Ramsey, Tej, strap in.

396
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:10,244
Whoop.

397
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,288
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta.

398
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,161
Dom, go ahead! I'm pinched!

399
00:30:28,563 --> 00:30:29,963
Dominic.

400
00:30:32,032 --> 00:30:33,133
Come on!

401
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:36,236
Damn it, he's fast.

402
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,279
Really? The clothesline?

403
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:46,614
Well, we can't drive it,

404
00:30:46,648 --> 00:30:48,382
guess we're just
gonna have to roll it.

405
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:10,572
Holy shit! The truck's
about to go over the hill!

406
00:31:10,605 --> 00:31:13,240
-We have to crash into it.
-We have to what?!

407
00:31:27,154 --> 00:31:30,090
I'm so sorry, my gold baby!

408
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:33,160
<i>It's not stopping!</i>

409
00:31:34,696 --> 00:31:36,997
<i>Dom, the bomb is out.</i>

410
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:42,136
Everybody, stay clear.
I got this.

411
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:44,037
No. We got this.

412
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,952
Letty!

413
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:12,166
Have we made them all
terrorists?

414
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,601
Their images have been
fed to the authorities.

415
00:32:13,635 --> 00:32:16,103
All right, Bob!
I got to go kill that jerk

416
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:17,672
that's trying to disarm my bomb.

417
00:32:17,705 --> 00:32:19,406
It's always something, you know?
Oh.

418
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,443
Remember, I still have your
families, so don't go anywhere.

422
00:33:10,625 --> 00:33:12,159
Hey! There he is!

423
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,428
Man of the hour.
Roman Pearce, team leader.

424
00:33:14,461 --> 00:33:17,164
Can't wait to see you
get out of this one.

425
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:25,439
Oh, Letty!

426
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:27,742
I think I found our guy.

427
00:33:27,775 --> 00:33:29,711
Hey, Letty. <i>Vaffanculo!</i>

428
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:32,412
I'm on him.

429
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:48,428

432
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:02,604

It's gonna blow! -Oh, shit.

433
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,474
Boom.

434
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:10,270
We need to jam
the detonator now.

435
00:36:10,303 --> 00:36:12,439
I got it, I got it.
Letty, don't lose him.

436
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:16,476
I can lock on to your location
and transmit

437
00:36:16,511 --> 00:36:18,278
cellular interference
through your phone.

438
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:20,715
That should jam his detonator
and buy us some time.

439
00:36:24,752 --> 00:36:25,787
Letty.

440
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:09,764
Bravo!

441
00:37:09,797 --> 00:37:11,264
It's getting tricky, guys.

442
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:12,934
I can't stay on him
for much longer.

443
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:14,869
Ramsey, how deep is that river?

444
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,938
The Tiber? Uh...

445
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:18,506
Uh, 60 feet.

446
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:19,974
I mean, the water could
smother the explosion,

447
00:37:20,007 --> 00:37:22,342
reduce its power
by ten times, maybe.

448
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:40,494
Damn it!

449
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:44,498
You missed me
by that much, baby!

450
00:37:48,669 --> 00:37:50,370
I lost him. He's gone.

451
00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:51,773
Damn!

452
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:52,907
He's out of our reach.

453
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,509
We can't jam the signal anymore.

491
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:05,266
Honestly, I-I don't know
what to call you.

492
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:07,101
Little Miss Nobody?

493
00:41:07,134 --> 00:41:08,769
How about you call me
by my actual name?

494
00:41:08,803 --> 00:41:12,006
Last I heard, Tess, you were
running ops in Damascus.

495
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,274
You think you can
walk in this room

496
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:14,842
just 'cause your daddy's
an agency legend?

497
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,610
I'm here because
someone needs to speak

498
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:18,112
on behalf of the defense.

499
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:20,648
What just happened in Rome
was an unmitigated disaster.

500
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:22,183
Casualties were kept
to a minimum,

501
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:23,684
but the impact was global.

502
00:41:23,718 --> 00:41:26,120
And what do you think
happened in Italy?

503
00:41:26,153 --> 00:41:29,623
Oh, sightseeing,
eating bucatini,

504
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,659
-stealing a 20-kiloton bomb.
-Oh, come on, Aimes.

505
00:41:31,692 --> 00:41:34,128
-That's bullshit
and you know it. -Careful, now.

506
00:41:34,161 --> 00:41:35,863
With Little Nobody
out of commission

507
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:39,266
and your daddy in the wind,
you're talking to the new boss.

508
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,302
Showtime.

509
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:43,537
Los Angeles, 2001.

510
00:41:43,571 --> 00:41:45,906
Humble roots, local kids,

511
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,676
street racers
who became hijackers.

512
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:51,145
Graduated to
high-speed smuggling,

513
00:41:51,178 --> 00:41:52,813
mobile jailbreaks,
train robberies.

514
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:55,750
If it could be done in a car,
they did it.

515
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:59,320
If it violates the laws of God
and gravity, they did it twice.

516
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:01,989
You write that yourself?

517
00:42:02,023 --> 00:42:03,924
We first took notice in 2011,

518
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:07,328
Rio, when they robbed
a drug kingpin, Hernan Reyes,

519
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:09,296
left his body on a bridge.

520
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:12,967
My predecessor, Mr. Nobody,
saw potential,

521
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,269
so he recruited them--
freelance, of course.

522
00:42:15,302 --> 00:42:17,605
They ran missions for us
in Abu Dhabi,

523
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:20,207
Tokyo, London,
New York, Tbilisi.

524
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:22,176
You ask me, we should've
cut ties years back,

525
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:24,912
but they had their champions.

526
00:42:24,945 --> 00:42:26,247
That's their M.O.

527
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,182
To corrupt law enforcement.

528
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:29,650
Brian O'Conner.

529
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:31,352
Elena Neves. Luke Hobbs.

530
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:33,254
Everyone becomes family.

531
00:42:33,287 --> 00:42:35,189
It's like a cult with cars.

532
00:42:35,222 --> 00:42:38,826
Even Tess's dear old dad.

533
00:42:39,693 --> 00:42:40,895
So we're all just

534
00:42:40,928 --> 00:42:43,330
a barbecue and a beer away
from corruption?

535
00:42:43,364 --> 00:42:44,799
What's your point?

536
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:46,200
Point is they're criminals.

537
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:48,035
Rome was a matter of time.

538
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:49,804
They've stolen
hundreds of millions of dollars

539
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:53,040
and at least one nuclear sub.

540
00:42:53,074 --> 00:42:56,811
The real question is: How did
we let this go on so long?

541
00:42:56,844 --> 00:42:59,246
This family has gotten their
hands dirty to keep ours clean.

542
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,117
They've driven to the gates of
hell and back for this agency.

543
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:05,052
Something is not right
with Rome.

544
00:43:05,086 --> 00:43:06,153
It can't be.

545
00:43:06,187 --> 00:43:08,656
It can and it is.

546
00:43:08,689 --> 00:43:10,291
The agency is better than this.

547
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:11,859
We are smarter than this.

548
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:13,627
We should be standing with Dom
and his family.

549
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:15,029
That is the very least
that we can do.

550
00:43:15,062 --> 00:43:16,864
If we don't act,
this blows back on all of us.

551
00:43:16,897 --> 00:43:19,800
The fallout will be existential.

552
00:43:21,435 --> 00:43:23,838
I'm asking for
full green-light authority.

553
00:43:23,871 --> 00:43:26,340
Kill or capture
the Toretto clan by any means.

554
00:43:26,373 --> 00:43:28,342
Aimes, what are you doing?

555
00:43:35,149 --> 00:43:37,118
Looks like the ayes have it.

556
00:43:37,151 --> 00:43:38,986
As your direct superior,

557
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:41,689
I don't give a shit about
anybody's heart of gold,

558
00:43:41,722 --> 00:43:44,425
and I hate barbecues.

559
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:47,061
You know I'd make a
freight train take a dirt road,

560
00:43:47,094 --> 00:43:50,164
so do not get in my way.

561
00:43:53,134 --> 00:43:54,802
Okay.

562
00:43:58,038 --> 00:43:59,340
I'll go my own way.

563
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,038
When Rome falls,
so does the world.

564
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:34,275
Well, it ain't no Roman holiday.

565
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:37,144
And you're no Gregory Peck.

566
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:39,079
Mm.

567
00:44:39,113 --> 00:44:40,714
My family?

568
00:44:40,748 --> 00:44:44,318
Your team's gone to ground.
They're safe for now.

569
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:46,954
They've taken Letty.

570
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:50,357
-Who's they?
-The agency.

571
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:52,193
And you've just shot
to number one

572
00:44:52,226 --> 00:44:53,928
on the world's most wanted list.

573
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:57,331
Whoever did this wanted
to sever your ties to the agency

574
00:44:57,364 --> 00:44:59,233
and isolate you
from your family.

575
00:44:59,266 --> 00:45:02,504
Any attempt to contact your team
will be traced.

576
00:45:02,537 --> 00:45:05,172
I need you to get a message
to Mr. Nobody.

577
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:07,841
You'll need a medium for that
or a magician.

578
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,877
He's done his disappearing act.

579
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,346
Just get the message out.

580
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:14,748
Tell him I'm ready
to have that Belgian,

581
00:45:14,782 --> 00:45:15,950
and he'll know where to go.

582
00:45:15,983 --> 00:45:17,519
I've got a message for you,
ducky.

583
00:45:17,552 --> 00:45:20,955
The world is on fire,
and you want to keep running

584
00:45:20,988 --> 00:45:23,257
into the burning building
to save lives,

585
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,493
but eventually the building's
gonna collapse on you.

586
00:45:26,528 --> 00:45:28,262
I don't care about dying.

587
00:45:29,396 --> 00:45:33,734
I only care about protecting
the people that I love.

588
00:45:34,536 --> 00:45:37,338
You know why gladiators
never had families?

589
00:45:37,371 --> 00:45:39,406
-Why?
-Because they knew

590
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,109
that every day
might be their last.

591
00:45:42,142 --> 00:45:46,280
You're choosing a lonely way,
my darling.

592
00:45:46,313 --> 00:45:49,049
Can't take anyone with you.

593
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:11,506
Bring God's Eye online.

594
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:13,575
-Yes, sir.
-Initiating.

595
00:46:13,608 --> 00:46:15,442
Get me Toretto
and the others' locations

596
00:46:15,476 --> 00:46:17,011
to the millimeter.

597
00:46:17,044 --> 00:46:18,580
Sir, we have a problem.

598
00:46:18,613 --> 00:46:20,447
The God's Eye tracking hardware
has been removed.

599
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:22,216
Tess.

600
00:46:22,249 --> 00:46:24,552
I guess her visit
wasn't purely a social call.

601
00:46:24,586 --> 00:46:26,053
Do me a favor.

602
00:46:26,086 --> 00:46:28,422
She pops up on any grid,
let's see where she goes.

603
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:32,393
As for the rest, our fugitives
aren't unknown quantities.

604
00:46:32,426 --> 00:46:36,163
Toretto has a sister, a son.

605
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:38,399
Until we find him,

606
00:46:38,432 --> 00:46:40,167
find his family.

607
00:46:59,654 --> 00:47:02,256
Oh!

608
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,091
Again.

609
00:47:04,124 --> 00:47:06,193
Wow.

610
00:47:06,226 --> 00:47:07,928
Are you cheating
on-on your favorite auntie?

611
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:10,565
It doesn't matter if you win
by an inch or a mile.

612
00:47:10,598 --> 00:47:11,899
Winning's winning.

613
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:13,867
Where have I heard
that one before?

614
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,405
Go! Go!

615
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,242
Search everywhere!
We need them alive!

616
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:30,150
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

617
00:47:32,353 --> 00:47:34,288
No! Mia! Let her go!

618
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:40,994
Run!

619
00:48:07,522 --> 00:48:09,524
-What's up?
-Uncle Jakob?

620
00:48:09,557 --> 00:48:10,558
Your dad sent me.

621
00:48:12,393 --> 00:48:13,427
Change of plans.

622
00:48:32,312 --> 00:48:33,615
Don't move!

623
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:35,949
I said don't move!

624
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:17,991
Do you have Little B?

625
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:20,194
B!

626
00:49:21,763 --> 00:49:24,131
Freeze!

627
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,405
-You okay?
-Yeah.

628
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:39,514
Are you okay?

629
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:45,385
B!

630
00:49:45,419 --> 00:49:47,120
Come, come.

631
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:52,092
Who the hell were those guys?

632
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:55,162
Agency. Rome was a trap.
Whole family's being targeted.

633
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:56,631
Okay, I got to get to Brian
and the kids...

634
00:49:56,664 --> 00:49:58,098
Dom sent me to take him.

635
00:49:58,131 --> 00:50:00,067
Remember that place
we said we'd go

636
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,235
if the world went to hell?

637
00:50:01,268 --> 00:50:03,237
Dom wants the team
to meet there.

638
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,506
Yeah.

639
00:50:04,539 --> 00:50:05,773
Okay, look.

640
00:50:05,807 --> 00:50:07,307
Little B, you're gonna go
with Uncle Jakob.

641
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:09,544
Okay? You do whatever he says.
Yeah?

642
00:50:09,577 --> 00:50:12,446
I'm gonna get you to your dad.
If that's okay with you.

643
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,550
Protect him with your life.

644
00:50:16,784 --> 00:50:18,720
I love you, Jakey.

645
00:50:18,753 --> 00:50:21,255
I love you, too, sis.

646
00:50:21,288 --> 00:50:23,056
Let's do it.

647
00:50:31,298 --> 00:50:34,569
Oh, my God.

648
00:50:37,237 --> 00:50:38,740
Yo!

649
00:50:38,773 --> 00:50:40,608
It's not that one.

650
00:50:40,642 --> 00:50:42,544
It's this one.

651
00:50:43,511 --> 00:50:45,379
Yep.

652
00:50:47,414 --> 00:50:48,550
Wait, but...

653
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,384
Hmm?

654
00:51:21,481 --> 00:51:23,350
I'm looking for someone.

655
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:25,620
You boys look like
you could use a drink.

656
00:51:25,653 --> 00:51:28,790
How about a round on me? Huh?

657
00:51:28,823 --> 00:51:30,390
As a matter of fact,

658
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:34,161
I will buy as many rounds
as they can handle.

659
00:51:46,908 --> 00:51:48,643
Shots? No?

660
00:51:48,676 --> 00:51:50,545
Shots?

661
00:51:58,753 --> 00:52:00,521
Beers. Two of 'em.

662
00:52:01,723 --> 00:52:03,323
Thanks.

663
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:05,660
Cheers.

664
00:52:08,428 --> 00:52:11,498
Queenie told me
I could find you here.

665
00:52:11,532 --> 00:52:12,767
Belgian?

666
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,936
Mr. Nobody said
he had a daughter.

667
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:17,204
He did?

668
00:52:17,237 --> 00:52:20,908
Well, now that
he's gone missing,

669
00:52:20,942 --> 00:52:22,744
I came in from the cold.

670
00:52:22,777 --> 00:52:24,646
Your dad kept the agency
in line.

671
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:28,215
Now it feels like
all the anchors have been cut.

672
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:32,520
In a world where there is
no code, no one's safe.

673
00:52:32,553 --> 00:52:34,454
You're right.

674
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:37,659
The agency has turned its back
on everything it stood for.

675
00:52:37,692 --> 00:52:41,261
The new boss, Aimes, he's coming
for you with everything.

676
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:44,264
I'm buying you some time.

677
00:52:44,297 --> 00:52:49,403
And borrowed their, uh,
little tracking device thingy.

678
00:52:50,605 --> 00:52:51,806
Look familiar?

679
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,340
-God's Eye.
-Mm-hmm.

680
00:52:53,373 --> 00:52:54,876
I'd put that
in a vault somewhere.

681
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:58,546
People pull vaults out of walls,
so I think it's safer with me.

682
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:00,213
I pulled a screen grab

683
00:53:00,247 --> 00:53:01,849
off of a traffic cam
that they missed,

684
00:53:01,883 --> 00:53:03,618
put it in God's Eye.

685
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:05,419
There was a hit in Rio.

686
00:53:05,452 --> 00:53:07,989
You wouldn't happen to have
any enemies in Rio, would you?

687
00:53:08,022 --> 00:53:10,457
-Reyes.
-Hernan Reyes?

688
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:15,395
Still pretty dead,
but he has a son, Dante.

689
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:19,266
So you're gonna
have to get me to Rio.

690
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:22,537
That's your second wish.
You have one more.

691
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:24,739
Letty.

692
00:53:27,742 --> 00:53:30,845
Letty's in a black site prison
off of every map.

693
00:53:30,878 --> 00:53:32,013
Then get her out.

694
00:53:32,046 --> 00:53:33,715
Nobody can.

695
00:53:33,748 --> 00:53:35,616
Nobody would.

696
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:36,984
Dom, I'm so sorry,

697
00:53:37,018 --> 00:53:40,521
but what you're asking me to do
is impossible.

698
00:53:48,062 --> 00:53:50,464
Nothing's impossible.

699
00:53:53,868 --> 00:53:55,737
You just have to have faith.

700
00:54:06,647 --> 00:54:10,051
Sneaking us out of Rome
in a shipping container

701
00:54:10,084 --> 00:54:12,486
full of aftershave,
that was a terrible idea, Roman.

702
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,489
Wait, I think
I lost my sense of smell.

703
00:54:15,523 --> 00:54:17,491
That is not aftershave.
That is tear gas.

704
00:54:17,525 --> 00:54:20,293
Hey, man, I don't know
what y'all are talking about.

705
00:54:20,327 --> 00:54:22,029
You know what I mean?

706
00:54:22,063 --> 00:54:23,698
I smell magic.

707
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:24,999
I took a bottle for myself.

708
00:54:25,032 --> 00:54:26,768
This is all thanks to you.

709
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:28,401
You know that, right?

710
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:30,772
No, see, you just got to follow
my "leat" as a "leater."

711
00:54:30,805 --> 00:54:34,642
You see what I'm saying?
I'm a natural-born "leater."

712
00:54:34,675 --> 00:54:36,476
Where are we?

713
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:38,445
I brought you back home, Ramsey.

714
00:54:38,478 --> 00:54:40,982
The city with the most
amount of surveillance cameras.

715
00:54:41,015 --> 00:54:42,315
Perfect.

716
00:54:52,392 --> 00:54:55,395
-Dad know you drive this thing?
-He should.

717
00:54:55,428 --> 00:54:56,597
I raced him in it.

718
00:54:56,631 --> 00:54:59,432
And just so you know,
in the '90s,

719
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:02,103
if you were rolling in a 5.0,
it meant you were the man.

720
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:04,839
Like it or not,
it's still a 'Stang.

721
00:55:04,872 --> 00:55:07,642
So, you know, respect.

722
00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:09,844
You know what?

723
00:55:11,712 --> 00:55:12,847
Traveling music.

724
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,822
I got this car when I was 13.

725
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:24,457
Did the repaint myself.
Rebuilt the motor, too.

726
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:28,029
Ah. Sometimes you just
can't help what you love, kid.

727
00:55:28,062 --> 00:55:30,430
Are you gonna tell me
where we're going?

728
00:55:32,465 --> 00:55:34,467
A place of mine your dad knows.

729
00:55:34,502 --> 00:55:35,837
We're gonna meet him there.

730
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,370
So he's okay?

731
00:55:38,471 --> 00:55:39,774
We'll meet him there.

732
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,918
This guy was an underwear model.

733
00:55:50,952 --> 00:55:53,120
-What?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

734
00:55:53,154 --> 00:55:54,755
Here we go and...

735
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:56,423
Little B, bring it back.
It's a boomerang.

736
00:55:56,456 --> 00:55:57,892
It's a boomerang, maybe.

737
00:55:57,925 --> 00:55:59,160
Ah...

738
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:01,829
Oh! Look at you!

739
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:03,064
That's feeling it.

740
00:56:03,097 --> 00:56:04,799
That's called
feeling the vibrations.

741
00:56:04,832 --> 00:56:07,034
<i>It's just energy, man.</i>
<i>It's energy. It's vibrations.</i>

742
00:56:07,068 --> 00:56:08,636
<i>Feel it! Feel it!</i>

743
00:56:08,669 --> 00:56:10,605
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

744
00:56:17,645 --> 00:56:20,181
You're clear, Director.

745
00:56:27,188 --> 00:56:29,123
Fancy coat.

746
00:56:29,156 --> 00:56:31,424
Expensive earrings.

747
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:33,527
Those got to hurt.

748
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:36,898
You really brought out
the big guns, huh?

749
00:56:36,931 --> 00:56:38,666
I'm not here for the agency.

750
00:56:39,934 --> 00:56:42,069
You could've confiscated that.

751
00:56:42,103 --> 00:56:44,138
That scar on your left wrist,

752
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:46,439
you got it
the night you met Dom.

753
00:56:46,473 --> 00:56:48,042
He said he was showing off.

754
00:56:48,075 --> 00:56:50,177
I put an ultrasonic jammer
on the audio,

755
00:56:50,211 --> 00:56:52,479
but the cameras
can still see us.

756
00:56:53,547 --> 00:56:56,017
Look, I'm gonna
get you out of here,

757
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,151
but it's gonna take some time.

758
00:56:57,184 --> 00:56:58,920
Time is what I don't have.

759
00:56:58,953 --> 00:57:00,187
I need to get back to Dom.

760
00:57:00,221 --> 00:57:02,523
I'm no good to anyone
in this cage.

761
00:57:02,556 --> 00:57:06,060
I have a feeling you didn't come
all this way without a plan.

762
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:08,863
Game recognizes game.

763
00:57:08,896 --> 00:57:12,533
If I make this move,
there's no coming back.

764
00:57:12,566 --> 00:57:14,835
I like it already.

765
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:17,939
Okay. First, let's get you
out of this cell.

766
00:57:17,972 --> 00:57:20,174
-It's gonna hurt.
-Hmm?

767
00:57:21,575 --> 00:57:23,144
Work with me.

768
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:24,545
Open the door!

769
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:25,546
Knock it down!

770
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:27,581
Guards! Guards!

771
00:57:27,615 --> 00:57:28,916
-Help!
-Let her go!

772
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,218
Let her go!

773
00:57:36,057 --> 00:57:38,059
Really?

774
00:58:36,050 --> 00:58:38,519
Que surpresa!

775
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,621
Look at this.

776
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:42,289
None of this happens
without you.

777
00:58:42,323 --> 00:58:44,225
Welcome home.
Good to see you, bro.

778
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:45,292
Diogo, good to see you.

779
00:58:45,326 --> 00:58:47,228
Ah. Look at you.

780
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:49,730
So, uh, I hear you got
a little heat on you.

781
00:58:49,764 --> 00:58:51,899
Nah, I'm just looking
for someone.

782
00:58:51,932 --> 00:58:53,567
How can we help?

783
00:58:57,138 --> 00:58:58,305
You already did.

784
00:59:17,691 --> 00:59:18,793
I need you to meet somebody.
A GOAT.

785
00:59:18,826 --> 00:59:19,994
A living legend, literally.

786
00:59:23,297 --> 00:59:25,332
You must be in
the winner's circle tonight.

787
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:27,668
I see you put in a RB26
in that, right?

788
00:59:27,701 --> 00:59:30,337
L24 would never handle
this much boost.

789
00:59:30,371 --> 00:59:31,939
My boy back home would approve.

790
00:59:31,972 --> 00:59:33,974
I'm not looking for
anyone's approval.

791
00:59:35,376 --> 00:59:38,245
Before you get ahead
of yourself, look around you.

792
00:59:38,279 --> 00:59:41,182
We're all looking for
a little validation.

793
00:59:41,215 --> 00:59:42,750
You racing or what?

794
00:59:42,783 --> 00:59:43,984
Trust me,
you don't want that smoke.

795
00:59:44,018 --> 00:59:45,152
I'm not here
for pink slips tonight.

796
00:59:50,024 --> 00:59:51,826
You and everyone here.

797
01:00:01,135 --> 01:00:03,270
Yeah!

798
01:00:09,777 --> 01:00:12,279
A million dollars
for whoever can beat me.

799
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:13,981
Diogo, here.

800
01:00:14,014 --> 01:00:15,116
Yes.

801
01:00:15,149 --> 01:00:16,851
Isabel.

802
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:21,122
There will be
a race tonight, yes?

803
01:00:21,155 --> 01:00:22,423
Yeah, maybe.

804
01:00:22,456 --> 01:00:23,858
Pretty please, with me on top.

805
01:00:26,894 --> 01:00:28,362
Dominic Toretto.

806
01:00:28,395 --> 01:00:30,798
I knew you would come for me.

807
01:00:30,831 --> 01:00:34,001
I'm sorry we didn't
get to meet in Roma.

808
01:00:34,034 --> 01:00:36,137
We were both so busy.

809
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,239
I'm Dante. <i>Enchanté.</i>

810
01:00:39,106 --> 01:00:44,278
And you were
<i>fantástico, fabuloso, o cara.</i>

811
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:46,247
He saved the Vatican.

812
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,414
Who does that?

813
01:00:47,448 --> 01:00:50,851
Seriously. The Pope? God?

814
01:00:50,885 --> 01:00:52,753
By the way,
did you see what I did there?

815
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:54,421
The ball through the city was

816
01:00:54,455 --> 01:00:57,191
a bit of an homage
to my family's safe.

817
01:00:57,224 --> 01:00:59,193
Except it was on fire.

818
01:01:02,196 --> 01:01:04,365
You remember my father?

819
01:01:04,398 --> 01:01:07,034
-Hernan Reyes.
-Yes.

820
01:01:07,067 --> 01:01:10,304
I remember he thought he had
his foot on this city's neck.

821
01:01:10,337 --> 01:01:11,972
But you know what happened?

822
01:01:12,006 --> 01:01:14,041
I took him down.

823
01:01:14,074 --> 01:01:17,478
Let's not argue
in front of the children.

824
01:01:17,512 --> 01:01:19,246
You are absolutely right.

825
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,982
My father was a horrible man,

826
01:01:22,016 --> 01:01:24,351
very bad daddy,

827
01:01:24,385 --> 01:01:26,187
but I kind of liked him.

828
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,989
And you took him from me
when you stole our money

829
01:01:29,023 --> 01:01:31,425
and left us
with nothing but suffering.

830
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:34,428
Well, that's what
I came here for.

831
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:37,164
To end that suffering.

832
01:01:38,465 --> 01:01:40,301
Oh, and I didn't take
that money.

833
01:01:43,204 --> 01:01:44,972
I burned it.

834
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:47,408
Uh-oh.

835
01:01:47,441 --> 01:01:50,377
Well, Brazil is mine,

836
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:52,079
and I own this city.

837
01:01:53,414 --> 01:01:55,182
Ooh.

838
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:01,855
You people think
you can buy everything.

839
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:05,826
But you can't buy the streets.

840
01:02:10,898 --> 01:02:12,733
We stand with Dom.

841
01:02:16,403 --> 01:02:18,172
Well, this is awkward.

842
01:02:18,205 --> 01:02:21,375
So, how about we all just
start shooting each other

843
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:22,376
and see what happens?

844
01:02:22,409 --> 01:02:25,379
Or we race.

845
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:27,314
If you win, you take me in.

846
01:02:27,348 --> 01:02:28,882
If you lose...

847
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:32,554
Don't lose.

848
01:02:32,587 --> 01:02:36,123
You all came 'cause
you wanted to see a race.

849
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,161
Let's race!

850
01:03:08,188 --> 01:03:09,390
Ouch.

851
01:03:17,298 --> 01:03:18,299
Ooh.

852
01:03:18,332 --> 01:03:20,602
Black on black look good.

853
01:03:20,635 --> 01:03:22,169
I know what you're thinking,

854
01:03:22,202 --> 01:03:24,305
and, yes, the carpet
matches the drapes.

855
01:03:24,338 --> 01:03:25,406
Thank you.

856
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:33,180
I can't believe I'm gonna race
the great Dominic Toretto.

857
01:03:33,213 --> 01:03:35,049
I have butterflies.

858
01:03:35,082 --> 01:03:36,618
You're just so impressive.

859
01:03:36,651 --> 01:03:38,553
You've won so many races.

860
01:03:38,586 --> 01:03:40,120
Everyone loves you.

861
01:03:41,088 --> 01:03:43,591
You've saved so many lives.

862
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,459
I know.

863
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:47,995
It's like you're a...

864
01:03:48,028 --> 01:03:50,064
a saint.

865
01:03:50,097 --> 01:03:52,266
Saint Dominic.

866
01:03:53,568 --> 01:03:55,969
And I've been studying you.

867
01:03:56,904 --> 01:03:58,272
And watching you.

868
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,009
I can't figure it out.

869
01:04:02,042 --> 01:04:03,143
How...

870
01:04:05,446 --> 01:04:07,014
How do you choose?

871
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:11,218
How do you choose
the ones you save?

872
01:04:38,379 --> 01:04:41,048
Cheguei.

873
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:10,712
Yahoo!

874
01:05:18,452 --> 01:05:20,354
Yeah!

875
01:05:27,461 --> 01:05:29,430
I'm beating you, baby!

876
01:05:37,204 --> 01:05:38,606
Oh.

877
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:40,174
You're too eager.

878
01:05:40,207 --> 01:05:41,975
That's what I'm talking about!

879
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:56,323
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You shouldn't do that.

880
01:06:04,031 --> 01:06:05,399
Dominic, who will you choose?

881
01:06:09,036 --> 01:06:10,337
Who you gonna choose, Dom?

882
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:13,541
Are you gonna save her?

883
01:06:16,076 --> 01:06:18,078
-Or are you gonna save him?
-Let's go, baby!

884
01:06:18,111 --> 01:06:20,515
This race is mine!

885
01:06:22,049 --> 01:06:23,551
Eeny, meeny, miny...

886
01:06:27,187 --> 01:06:29,490
Looks like you made your choice.

887
01:06:29,524 --> 01:06:30,558
Finally! Whoo!

888
01:06:34,261 --> 01:06:37,297
Oh, no, Diogo!

889
01:06:40,133 --> 01:06:41,736
Trick question. Everyone dies.

890
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:43,671
And one, two, three.

891
01:06:51,144 --> 01:06:53,380
Boom!

892
01:06:55,817 --> 01:06:57,284
Yeah!

893
01:07:02,557 --> 01:07:04,191
Yeah!

894
01:07:04,759 --> 01:07:07,127
I win, baby!

895
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,563
Keep coming, Dom!

896
01:07:08,596 --> 01:07:11,666
There's so much more fun
to be had!

897
01:07:13,701 --> 01:07:16,136
Come on.

898
01:08:07,755 --> 01:08:09,824
Good morning, sunshine.

899
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:11,559
Goddamn it.

900
01:08:13,493 --> 01:08:15,295
<i>And then he was like, "Boom!"</i>

901
01:08:15,329 --> 01:08:17,264
<i>And I was like, "Blam!"</i>
<i>And she was like, "What?"</i>

902
01:08:17,297 --> 01:08:19,132
<i>I was like, "Shut up."</i>

903
01:08:19,166 --> 01:08:21,335
And now I'm the best racer
in the world, so...

904
01:08:22,737 --> 01:08:25,472
Do not touch that. Let it dry.

905
01:08:27,675 --> 01:08:30,143
You guys look fantastic.

906
01:08:30,177 --> 01:08:33,548
I know the black is
very slimming and very scary,

907
01:08:33,581 --> 01:08:35,449
but the pastels, you know,
they're in season,

908
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:38,418
and I feel like it tones down
the masculinity a little bit,

909
01:08:38,452 --> 01:08:40,521
which we all need these days.

910
01:08:40,555 --> 01:08:42,857
Did you know...

911
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:44,525
Listen to me.

912
01:08:44,559 --> 01:08:46,894
Did you know that I was
legally dead for two minutes?

913
01:08:46,928 --> 01:08:48,395
Two minutes.

914
01:08:48,428 --> 01:08:50,632
Bob, pay attention.

915
01:08:50,665 --> 01:08:52,667
And you know what I saw?

916
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,868
Nothing.

917
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:56,336
Not a goddamn thing.

918
01:08:56,370 --> 01:09:00,508
But I do feel like
once he, uh...

919
01:09:00,541 --> 01:09:03,410
cracked my skull open,
it just opened my mind.

920
01:09:04,344 --> 01:09:06,413
Yeah, that's deep, right?

921
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:08,650
You're absolutely right, Bob.

922
01:09:08,683 --> 01:09:09,717
We should get back to work.

923
01:09:11,686 --> 01:09:12,920
Such a stickler.

924
01:09:14,254 --> 01:09:16,456
All right. Let's see.

925
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:17,825
Should we take all their money?

926
01:09:19,727 --> 01:09:22,362
You. You are evil.

927
01:09:22,396 --> 01:09:24,231
Thank you for listening.

928
01:09:24,264 --> 01:09:25,833
So, <i>mi casa, su casa.</i>

929
01:09:25,867 --> 01:09:28,201
Let these dry,
finish those mojitos,

930
01:09:28,235 --> 01:09:30,571
and, um, someone's gonna come
and bury you guys soon.

931
01:09:30,605 --> 01:09:32,573
I'm gonna go wash my hair.

932
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:01,569
No.

933
01:10:01,602 --> 01:10:02,637
What?

934
01:10:06,007 --> 01:10:07,575
All right.

935
01:10:09,777 --> 01:10:10,745
Whoa.

936
01:10:10,778 --> 01:10:12,914
Cool. What is that?

937
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:14,414
That's a technical tool kit.

938
01:10:14,448 --> 01:10:16,249
Don't worry, it's just
a bunch of awesome stuff

939
01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:17,952
that you're never
gonna get to use.

940
01:10:17,985 --> 01:10:20,588
Okay.

941
01:10:20,621 --> 01:10:22,724
Eyes open. Hold still.

942
01:10:22,757 --> 01:10:24,257
Don't smile like that.

943
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:25,893
It's unsettling.

944
01:10:25,927 --> 01:10:28,328
Sweet.
Your new name is Chester...

945
01:10:28,361 --> 01:10:30,898
-Chester? -...and you're
on a kayaking trip with

946
01:10:30,932 --> 01:10:31,933
your handsome,

947
01:10:31,966 --> 01:10:33,868
ripped Uncle Roger.

948
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:35,837
All right.

949
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:38,039
Now, time to get you
some new clothes.

950
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:39,807
You know, something
a little more chic than

951
01:10:39,841 --> 01:10:42,009
pj pants, all right?

952
01:10:42,043 --> 01:10:44,879
-From a gas station?
-From a gas station.

953
01:10:49,382 --> 01:10:51,318
<i>See, I just don't understand.</i>

954
01:10:51,351 --> 01:10:54,021
Why would the agency
turn they backs on us,

955
01:10:54,055 --> 01:10:55,990
after all we've done for them?

956
01:10:56,023 --> 01:10:57,558
That madman pinned it all on us,

957
01:10:57,592 --> 01:10:59,326
and now we're
public enemy number one.

958
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:02,764
Well, Dom is gonna meet us
at the rendezvous point.

959
01:11:02,797 --> 01:11:04,632
But in the meantime,
we have to stay under the radar.

960
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:06,366
And we got to get ready
to fight.

961
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:09,469
Wait, so we need guns,
artillery, tanks?

962
01:11:09,504 --> 01:11:12,039
Yeah, but how are we gonna
get that with no money?

963
01:11:12,073 --> 01:11:13,641
What?

964
01:11:13,674 --> 01:11:14,909
We've been hacked.

965
01:11:14,942 --> 01:11:16,611
Look. Every account.

966
01:11:16,644 --> 01:11:20,915
Every dollar we made
over the last 20 years is gone.

967
01:11:20,948 --> 01:11:22,315
He took everything.

968
01:11:22,349 --> 01:11:23,718
We got heisted
during our own heist.

969
01:11:23,751 --> 01:11:25,485
-Just decrypt the... Yeah.
-Decrypt the blockchain.

970
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:27,454
I'm on it. Then we can find
the transaction hash.

971
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:28,656
The transaction hash.

972
01:11:28,689 --> 01:11:29,657
Gets us the receiving IPs.
Exactly.

973
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:30,725
English.

974
01:11:30,758 --> 01:11:31,926
Following our money, genius.

975
01:11:31,959 --> 01:11:33,326
We're trying to see
where he sent it.

976
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,529
The coding is next-level.

977
01:11:34,562 --> 01:11:36,764
I've never seen
anything like this.

978
01:11:36,798 --> 01:11:39,066
We need more computing power.

979
01:11:39,100 --> 01:11:40,835
How are we gonna do that
if we broke?

980
01:11:40,868 --> 01:11:43,504
What do you mean, "we" broke?

981
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,109
Wait, you holding out on us?

982
01:11:48,142 --> 01:11:49,710
No wonder you've been so calm.

983
01:11:49,744 --> 01:11:52,814
Bro, what-what d--
what do you think this is, bro?

984
01:11:52,847 --> 01:11:54,882
You know what? Turn around.

985
01:11:54,916 --> 01:11:55,950
"Turn around"? What do you...

986
01:11:55,983 --> 01:11:57,417
What you mean, "turn around"?

987
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:59,520
Man, I'm a grown-ass...

988
01:12:00,655 --> 01:12:03,490
-What-- N-- What are you doing?
-Hey, Roman, do not.

989
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:07,962
Please tell me
you're not wearing Spanx.

990
01:12:07,995 --> 01:12:10,097
Oh, this ain't Spanx.
These banks.

991
01:12:10,131 --> 01:12:12,133
But it's okay, bro. I got you.

992
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:13,568
All right?

993
01:12:13,601 --> 01:12:16,336
You know what I mean?

994
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:20,842
Yeah. That's for you.

995
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:22,810
That's for you.

996
01:12:22,844 --> 01:12:23,978
Let me see.

997
01:12:24,011 --> 01:12:26,547
Han, you always good
for the bag,

998
01:12:26,581 --> 01:12:29,650
'cause the bag
always come back, you know.

999
01:12:29,684 --> 01:12:33,588
So what I need from
all of y'all, I need receipts.

1000
01:12:33,621 --> 01:12:36,557
Who is you talking to?
Got your receipt.

1001
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:40,661
So where do we go
to shop off the grid?

1002
01:12:41,863 --> 01:12:43,363
I know a place.

1003
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:02,516
Wait. The agency's after us.
Aren't they gonna see our faces?

1004
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:04,018
Yeah, I'm counting on it.

1005
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:05,553
The first rule of tradecraft:

1006
01:13:05,586 --> 01:13:07,487
you can't lose a tail
if they don't find you.

1007
01:13:07,521 --> 01:13:08,789
-Oh, sorry.
-Sorry.

1008
01:13:08,823 --> 01:13:10,191
I'll just-- Wait.
You know what, I'm just...

1009
01:13:10,224 --> 01:13:11,491
We'll just--
If you want to, uh, go.

1010
01:13:11,525 --> 01:13:12,860
Uh, we'll stay here.

1011
01:13:12,894 --> 01:13:14,161
-You guys, you guys go around.
-Go around? Great.

1012
01:13:14,195 --> 01:13:15,963
Go around.

1013
01:13:20,801 --> 01:13:22,770
<i>Sir, we just got a hit</i>
<i>on the boy and his uncle.</i>

1014
01:13:22,803 --> 01:13:24,505
The rest of the team
is still in Europe.

1015
01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:25,640
We're interfacing
with local authorities.

1016
01:13:25,673 --> 01:13:27,108
Forget authorities.

1017
01:13:27,141 --> 01:13:28,542
These people have been
outrunning the cops

1018
01:13:28,576 --> 01:13:29,777
since they could
reach the gas pedal.

1019
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:31,646
Get word to
every snitch, smuggler,

1020
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:32,947
hitter and hacker
we've ever used.

1021
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:35,650
Money talks and so will they.

1022
01:13:35,683 --> 01:13:37,084
We're getting an alert

1023
01:13:37,118 --> 01:13:38,085
on Black Site A.

1024
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:40,554
Tess just visited Ortiz.

1025
01:13:40,588 --> 01:13:42,023
They have a nice chat?

1026
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:44,825
Guess not.

1027
01:13:44,859 --> 01:13:47,595
Run it back for me.

1028
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:51,699
Stop. Zoom in.

1029
01:13:53,267 --> 01:13:55,102
Back-trace her flight path.

1030
01:13:55,136 --> 01:13:56,837
Find out where she was
before this.

1031
01:13:56,871 --> 01:13:58,706
That's where Dom is.

1032
01:14:13,754 --> 01:14:16,257
You knew who I was
all along, didn't you?

1033
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:18,092
From the moment I saw you.

1034
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:22,930
Your sister smiled with her eyes
and led with her heart.

1035
01:14:24,865 --> 01:14:26,968
Just like you do.

1036
01:14:28,202 --> 01:14:29,904
We were nothing alike.

1037
01:14:29,937 --> 01:14:32,540
She was the good sister.

1038
01:14:32,573 --> 01:14:34,542
Always putting others first.

1039
01:14:34,575 --> 01:14:36,844
Always doing what was right.

1040
01:14:39,747 --> 01:14:42,817
Sometimes I would think
that the wrong sister died.

1041
01:14:44,018 --> 01:14:46,087
Why the good one and not me?

1042
01:14:56,597 --> 01:15:00,134
You're wrong about
not being anything like her.

1043
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:03,037
You think
that's what she wants to hear?

1044
01:15:05,272 --> 01:15:07,942
A cop and a street racer.

1045
01:15:07,975 --> 01:15:09,844
I'll tell you something.

1046
01:15:09,877 --> 01:15:12,947
They travel down the same road
long enough...

1047
01:15:14,782 --> 01:15:18,519
...and they realize
how much alike they really are.

1048
01:15:20,254 --> 01:15:22,556
Trust me...

1049
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:26,027
...I know.

1050
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:37,038
She's still doing it, isn't she?

1051
01:15:40,808 --> 01:15:43,077
She's still helping people.

1052
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:49,083
She's helping us.

1053
01:15:50,251 --> 01:15:52,753
You know, Elena,

1054
01:15:52,787 --> 01:15:55,089
she knew everything
about the Reyes family.

1055
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:56,824
After they killed her husband,

1056
01:15:56,857 --> 01:15:59,660
she dedicated her life
trying to take them down.

1057
01:15:59,693 --> 01:16:03,030
I think I still have her files.

1058
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:06,967
<i>Wait, so we gonna find</i>
<i>military-grade gear</i>

1059
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:08,369
<i>in the middle of London?</i>

1060
01:16:08,402 --> 01:16:10,071
You said you wanted
to shop off the grid.

1061
01:16:13,841 --> 01:16:16,944
Wait a second.
Did we just time-travel?

1062
01:16:16,977 --> 01:16:19,246
Would you look for
a black-market operation

1063
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,981
in a place like this?

1064
01:16:22,783 --> 01:16:23,984
You've got mail.

1065
01:16:24,018 --> 01:16:26,087
-Ooh, snacks.
-Get me a receipt, homey.

1066
01:16:27,154 --> 01:16:30,291
How am I gonna get a receipt
from a vending machine?

1067
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:31,826
How about you figure it out?

1068
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:34,361
Paper trail, bruh.
For tax write-off.

1069
01:16:34,395 --> 01:16:35,896
I swear to God...

1070
01:16:37,398 --> 01:16:38,966
What's up, Bowie420?

1071
01:16:38,999 --> 01:16:41,635
Oh, shit. FreddieMerc?

1072
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:45,239
What? I had a life
before you knew me.

1073
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:48,175
Bowie here runs
one of the most notorious

1074
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:49,877
online black markets.

1075
01:16:49,910 --> 01:16:51,879
If you want it, he'll sell it.

1076
01:16:51,912 --> 01:16:53,347
I thought you didn't like that
about me, though.

1077
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,882
Well, desperate times.

1078
01:16:54,915 --> 01:16:56,317
What kind of muffins are these?

1079
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:57,651
Oh, those are fun muffins.

1080
01:16:57,685 --> 01:16:59,053
You have like four of them,

1081
01:16:59,086 --> 01:17:00,788
you'll be in your underwear
watching <i>Fantasia.</i>

1082
01:17:00,821 --> 01:17:01,989
Is that what you guys came for?
My muffins?

1083
01:17:02,022 --> 01:17:03,724
Oh, it's gonna be
a muffin party?

1084
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:07,128
We, uh, we need transport.

1085
01:17:07,161 --> 01:17:09,263
Weapons, cars, the works.

1086
01:17:09,296 --> 01:17:10,798
And quietly.

1087
01:17:10,831 --> 01:17:12,366
Cool, then I'm just
gonna need cash. Okay?

1088
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:13,868
None of that crypto stuff.

1089
01:17:13,901 --> 01:17:15,936
Oh, the Black Jeff Bezos here
got you covered.

1090
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:18,706
-Black Bezos? -Yeah, he's even
been into outer space.

1091
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:20,808
-Wow. -If y'all was gonna be
giving out my money,

1092
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:22,810
I'd appreciate
some type of a heads-up,

1093
01:17:22,843 --> 01:17:24,145
you know what I'm saying?

1094
01:17:24,178 --> 01:17:26,180
How much we talking about, bruh?

1095
01:17:26,213 --> 01:17:27,848
Just like a reasonable amount.

1096
01:17:28,282 --> 01:17:30,217
How about that?

1097
01:17:31,852 --> 01:17:33,254
That won't even cover
the muffins.

1098
01:17:33,287 --> 01:17:34,421
Is this guy serious?

1099
01:17:34,455 --> 01:17:36,423
Shit's crazy. Mm-kay.

1100
01:17:36,457 --> 01:17:38,792
Come on, man,
you're an astronaut.

1101
01:17:39,994 --> 01:17:42,062
Well, how about that?

1102
01:17:42,096 --> 01:17:43,764
What, did you leave
all your money in space?

1103
01:17:43,797 --> 01:17:45,432
Man, give me this.

1104
01:17:45,466 --> 01:17:47,168
-Thank you.
-Are you serious right now?

1105
01:17:47,201 --> 01:17:49,703
You know I pay for everything
around here, right?

1106
01:17:49,737 --> 01:17:51,338
You should pay for everything.

1107
01:17:51,372 --> 01:17:54,775
It's your mission in Rome that
got us here in the first place.

1108
01:17:54,808 --> 01:17:57,077
No, it was your intel
that led us to Rome.

1109
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:59,246
To be fair, that setup would
have confused the best of us.

1110
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,447
No, I'm tired of this.

1111
01:18:00,481 --> 01:18:01,982
'Cause all he do is talk.

1112
01:18:02,016 --> 01:18:04,285
And then everyone
has to do their job and yours.

1113
01:18:04,318 --> 01:18:05,786
What are you saying, Tej?

1114
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:07,254
-Mean, what I'm saying?
-Hey, guys.

1115
01:18:07,288 --> 01:18:09,356
-This is a family environment.
-What? Really?

1116
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:11,292
-Really?
-Take it outside, fellas.

1117
01:18:11,325 --> 01:18:14,061
So, what we doing, bruh?

1118
01:18:14,094 --> 01:18:15,129
Uh-oh.

1119
01:18:15,162 --> 01:18:17,998
Gentlemen, please! Guys!

1120
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,235
-Oh, not the vending machine.
No. -Unbelievable.

1121
01:18:21,268 --> 01:18:24,338
Guys, you're causing like
dozens of dollars in damage!

1122
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:26,207
Let's go. Come on.

1123
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,242
Should we stop this?

1124
01:18:29,476 --> 01:18:32,813
-Hold on!
-Nah, let 'em bond.

1125
01:18:33,447 --> 01:18:36,016
Hey!
That computer's from, like, '98!

1126
01:18:37,117 --> 01:18:38,852
Huh?

1127
01:18:39,787 --> 01:18:42,790
What the hell, man?

1128
01:18:53,234 --> 01:18:55,269
Okay. All right.

1129
01:18:55,302 --> 01:18:56,504
We doing stomachs now.

1130
01:18:56,538 --> 01:18:58,172
All right, all right,
that's enough.

1131
01:18:58,205 --> 01:18:59,907
-You've been wanting that
for years! -Uh, I think

1132
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,042
he hit the copy machine so hard
it works now.

1133
01:19:06,313 --> 01:19:07,848
What the hell was that?

1134
01:19:07,881 --> 01:19:08,983
He's like a ghetto magician.

1135
01:19:09,016 --> 01:19:10,985
You know what it is, bruh.

1136
01:19:11,018 --> 01:19:13,187
-I beat your ass.
-You just beat my ass?

1137
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,388
-Beat my ass, huh?
-My God,

1138
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:15,856
will you two just quit it?
Please.

1139
01:19:15,889 --> 01:19:17,825
We don't have time for this.
You.

1140
01:19:17,858 --> 01:19:19,260
-Get to work.
-Oh, I just need

1141
01:19:19,293 --> 01:19:21,295
to hack into the marketplace.
It'll just take a second.

1142
01:19:21,328 --> 01:19:23,464
Oops.

1143
01:19:23,497 --> 01:19:25,332
What the hell, Bowie?
What did you just do?

1144
01:19:25,366 --> 01:19:26,800
I'm sorry.
Your guys's faces are,

1145
01:19:26,834 --> 01:19:28,402
like, all over the dark web.

1146
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:30,137
I mean, that reward is dope.

1147
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:32,006
-Ow. Hey.
-We have to move.

1148
01:19:32,039 --> 01:19:34,441
-The agency's minutes away.
-Look, it's nothing personal.

1149
01:19:34,475 --> 01:19:36,877
-Hey, fun muffins on me, okay?
-What? Huh?

1150
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:37,911
-Oh!
-Oh!

1151
01:19:37,945 --> 01:19:40,080
I deserved that.

1152
01:19:40,114 --> 01:19:42,550
-Are you okay, bro?
-Yeah, thank you, man.

1153
01:19:48,055 --> 01:19:49,557
All right, so where to now, huh?

1154
01:19:49,591 --> 01:19:51,025
Jail?

1155
01:19:51,058 --> 01:19:54,295
I know somewhere.
Last place I want to go.

1156
01:20:19,953 --> 01:20:22,557
How does it feel to be
on my side of the law?

1157
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:25,459
They like to fix things
before they break 'em.

1158
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:28,228
It's a sick place, Letty.

1159
01:20:31,332 --> 01:20:33,067
You're welcome.

1160
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,201
What did you do?

1161
01:20:34,234 --> 01:20:37,438
I rerouted anesthetic gas
into their air conditioning.

1162
01:20:37,471 --> 01:20:41,041
And I bought us a few minutes
before these cameras reset

1163
01:20:41,075 --> 01:20:43,977
and they find out this place
turned into a sleep study.

1164
01:20:48,148 --> 01:20:51,285
You gonna stay grumpy or
do you want to get out of here?

1165
01:20:52,386 --> 01:20:54,922
They're not gonna sleep forever.

1166
01:20:54,955 --> 01:20:57,858
Don't you want to get back
to your precious family?

1167
01:20:58,992 --> 01:21:00,961
Shit.

1168
01:21:03,531 --> 01:21:05,499
Seems like you got this covered.

1169
01:21:05,533 --> 01:21:07,368
-What do you need me for?
-I have a plan,

1170
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:10,037
but it's a two-person job.

1171
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,414
Now, was that so hard?

1172
01:21:21,348 --> 01:21:23,417
How much time do we have?

1173
01:21:23,450 --> 01:21:25,520
I'd say about four minutes.

1174
01:21:25,553 --> 01:21:26,654
It'll have to do.

1175
01:21:39,734 --> 01:21:41,201
I'd stay down if I was you.

1176
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:43,971
You got to hit me harder
for that.

1177
01:21:44,004 --> 01:21:45,607
You're gonna regret this.

1178
01:23:13,661 --> 01:23:16,997
Dante Reyes.

1179
01:23:18,131 --> 01:23:19,801
Born in Portugal.

1180
01:23:19,834 --> 01:23:22,770
Mother from the Pacific Islands.

1181
01:23:22,804 --> 01:23:25,773
Sociopathic tendencies
from an early age.

1182
01:23:25,807 --> 01:23:29,109
He bounced from juvie to prison
to mental wards.

1183
01:23:29,142 --> 01:23:31,378
And each time, Daddy was there
to spring him out.

1184
01:23:31,411 --> 01:23:35,182
After his father died,
he disappeared.

1185
01:23:35,215 --> 01:23:39,654
Properties Reyes owned
before he died.

1186
01:23:39,687 --> 01:23:42,389
Now all sold and repo'd.

1187
01:23:42,422 --> 01:23:44,124
Except this one.

1188
01:23:45,527 --> 01:23:47,662
The police station.

1189
01:23:47,695 --> 01:23:50,063
It's been abandoned for years.

1190
01:23:50,097 --> 01:23:52,366
And guess whose name
is on the deed.

1191
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:55,435
Dante Reyes.

1192
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:58,038
I'll find my answer there.

1193
01:23:59,574 --> 01:24:02,544
I'm coming with you.

1194
01:24:05,178 --> 01:24:08,181
I need you to stay safe.

1195
01:24:13,353 --> 01:24:16,189
I would have won that race,
you know.

1196
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:18,292
So you want a rematch?

1197
01:24:18,325 --> 01:24:20,695
I'm demanding it.

1198
01:24:20,728 --> 01:24:23,497
So I guess I'll see you soon.

1199
01:24:55,195 --> 01:24:57,632
Guys, you don't want to do this.

1200
01:24:57,665 --> 01:24:59,801
He needs a new watch, cop.

1201
01:24:59,834 --> 01:25:01,435
Look, the watch was a gift.

1202
01:25:01,468 --> 01:25:03,871
But I got 16 carats of
uncut diamonds in my jockstrap

1203
01:25:03,905 --> 01:25:05,640
if you want to take a look.

1204
01:25:15,717 --> 01:25:18,620
Now you really do need
a new watch.

1205
01:25:23,825 --> 01:25:25,560
Damn it.

1206
01:25:35,435 --> 01:25:36,537
B, you okay?

1207
01:25:38,573 --> 01:25:39,907
Tried gum? Gum helps.

1208
01:25:39,941 --> 01:25:42,409
I don't like planes.

1209
01:25:42,442 --> 01:25:45,345
If it's the height,
that's gonna be an issue.

1210
01:25:46,313 --> 01:25:48,683
You know, I used to be
scared of cars.

1211
01:25:49,617 --> 01:25:53,521
After my dad died,
I guess I blamed myself.

1212
01:25:53,554 --> 01:25:54,354
It was tough.

1213
01:25:54,388 --> 01:25:56,958
I had panic attacks,
the whole bit.

1214
01:25:56,991 --> 01:25:58,559
Heck, I took the bus.

1215
01:25:58,593 --> 01:26:01,495
Yeah. I think I was just
so worried about making mistakes

1216
01:26:01,529 --> 01:26:04,666
and not being
as good as my brother.

1217
01:26:04,699 --> 01:26:06,233
-You?
-Uh, excuse me.

1218
01:26:06,266 --> 01:26:07,869
Have you met your dad?

1219
01:26:07,902 --> 01:26:09,871
He casts a pretty big shadow.

1220
01:26:12,807 --> 01:26:15,543
Huh. Feeling better?

1221
01:26:15,576 --> 01:26:16,678
-Yeah.
-Good.

1222
01:26:16,711 --> 01:26:18,546
Me, too.

1223
01:26:22,583 --> 01:26:26,319
Here's the drink
that you ordered, sir.

1224
01:26:28,723 --> 01:26:30,558
You know her?

1225
01:26:30,591 --> 01:26:33,695
Yeah, it's good to have friends
in high places.

1226
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:35,462
On the count of three,

1227
01:26:35,495 --> 01:26:37,965
we're gonna get up
and go to the bathroom. Ready?

1228
01:26:37,999 --> 01:26:40,434
Three.

1229
01:27:15,335 --> 01:27:16,604
Who were those guys?

1230
01:27:16,637 --> 01:27:19,406
Agency. They found us.
Now let's lose our tail.

1231
01:27:27,682 --> 01:27:29,584
Holy shi...

1232
01:27:29,617 --> 01:27:33,921
Wait! Swearing is for song
lyrics only and stubbed toes.

1233
01:27:33,955 --> 01:27:35,489
Forget about it. Pay attention.

1234
01:27:35,523 --> 01:27:37,792
Okay?
We're-we're too high to glide,

1235
01:27:37,825 --> 01:27:40,962
so we need thrust,
which means, uh,

1236
01:27:40,995 --> 01:27:43,396
combustion, which means...?

1237
01:27:44,532 --> 01:27:48,035
Oxygen and fuel.

1238
01:27:48,069 --> 01:27:49,302
Alcohol.

1239
01:27:49,336 --> 01:27:50,638
-Um...
-Huh?

1240
01:27:50,671 --> 01:27:51,806
Oh.

1241
01:27:59,046 --> 01:28:00,548
That's rosé. Not gonna work.

1242
01:28:00,581 --> 01:28:02,415
Long story.
But good initiative.

1243
01:28:13,027 --> 01:28:14,996
I'm glad it wasn't the height.

1244
01:28:15,029 --> 01:28:16,731
Enjoy the ride, Little B.

1245
01:28:29,376 --> 01:28:30,912
Bowie tagged us.

1246
01:28:30,945 --> 01:28:32,345
The agency is on our tail.

1247
01:28:32,379 --> 01:28:33,648
We need to find gear

1248
01:28:33,681 --> 01:28:35,783
and get to the rendezvous
as soon as possible.

1249
01:28:35,817 --> 01:28:36,984
It's right here.

1250
01:28:37,885 --> 01:28:40,420
You guys hold back.
Let me take care of this.

1251
01:28:40,453 --> 01:28:42,557
No, no, no.
Th-That's a bad idea.

1252
01:28:42,590 --> 01:28:45,126
-I mean like Roman-level bad.
-What?

1253
01:28:45,159 --> 01:28:46,393
What are you talking about, man?

1254
01:28:46,426 --> 01:28:47,728
You heard what I said.

1255
01:28:47,762 --> 01:28:49,864
Look, bro, you don't
have to do this, man.

1256
01:28:49,897 --> 01:28:51,599
You know I got your back.

1257
01:28:51,632 --> 01:28:52,700
We got your back.

1258
01:28:55,870 --> 01:28:58,405
I got to do this alone.

1259
01:29:17,024 --> 01:29:19,492
I have something
to talk to you about.

1260
01:29:19,527 --> 01:29:22,930
The only reason a dead guy
shows up at my door:

1261
01:29:22,964 --> 01:29:24,364
revenge.

1262
01:29:28,903 --> 01:29:29,937
Oh, shi...

1263
01:29:33,207 --> 01:29:35,710
-Oh, shit.
-Shit. Han!

1264
01:29:36,944 --> 01:29:39,046
Should have stayed dead.

1265
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:40,915
I can get in. I can get in.

1266
01:29:41,883 --> 01:29:43,483
I don't like repeating myself.

1267
01:29:43,517 --> 01:29:45,820
You ruined my snacks.

1268
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:52,627
Relax.
I don't want to fight you.

1269
01:29:52,660 --> 01:29:54,695
Then this is gonna end quick.

1270
01:30:31,933 --> 01:30:33,200
You bring more men to kill me?

1271
01:30:33,234 --> 01:30:35,169
They're trying to kill me, too.

1272
01:30:35,937 --> 01:30:38,506
Well, it looks like
we got more company.

1273
01:30:38,539 --> 01:30:41,008
-You still drive?
-What do you think?

1274
01:30:44,178 --> 01:30:46,547
Okay, just give me a second.

1275
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:47,782
Freeze!

1276
01:31:11,005 --> 01:31:12,873
-Drop the laptop!
-Okay.

1277
01:31:39,033 --> 01:31:40,534
Guys, I'm in.

1278
01:31:52,146 --> 01:31:53,681
No, no, no, no!

1279
01:31:57,918 --> 01:31:59,253
Now we're even.

1280
01:32:06,093 --> 01:32:07,128
You okay?

1281
01:32:21,809 --> 01:32:25,579
Now, see, I understand all this.

1282
01:32:25,613 --> 01:32:26,947
What the hell was that?

1283
01:32:32,086 --> 01:32:33,888
You got scared. I saw that.

1284
01:32:33,921 --> 01:32:36,924
-Ain't nobody got scared, bruh.
-No, you were... he was scared.

1285
01:32:52,373 --> 01:32:53,707
We have an unwanted guest.

1286
01:32:53,741 --> 01:32:54,842
My family?

1287
01:32:54,875 --> 01:32:56,343
They're safe for now.

1288
01:32:56,377 --> 01:32:57,678
You're not afraid of anything.

1289
01:32:57,711 --> 01:32:59,113
I don't care about dying.

1290
01:32:59,146 --> 01:33:02,216
I only care about protecting
the people that I love.

1291
01:33:02,249 --> 01:33:03,350
Hold us in your heart

1292
01:33:03,384 --> 01:33:05,019
and you will never
lose your way.

1293
01:33:05,052 --> 01:33:06,353
You're not afraid of anything.

1294
01:33:06,387 --> 01:33:08,089
Fear can be a great teacher.

1295
01:33:08,122 --> 01:33:09,690
You're not afraid of anything.

1296
01:33:23,971 --> 01:33:25,806
How do you like my place?

1297
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:29,110
I'm bummed I'm not there
to show you around.

1298
01:33:29,143 --> 01:33:31,378
And a little embarrassed
you saw my vision board.

1299
01:33:33,013 --> 01:33:34,982
But at least you know
how hard I've been working

1300
01:33:35,015 --> 01:33:36,250
to get us to this point.

1301
01:33:36,283 --> 01:33:38,052
Now I know you're a dead man.

1302
01:33:38,085 --> 01:33:39,286
You mean resurrected.

1303
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:41,021
Thanks to you.

1304
01:33:41,055 --> 01:33:42,823
You know, if you never would
have gotten behind that wheel,

1305
01:33:42,857 --> 01:33:45,726
I'd never be the man
that I am today.

1306
01:33:45,759 --> 01:33:47,728
You built such a beautiful life,

1307
01:33:47,761 --> 01:33:50,764
filled with love and family.

1308
01:33:50,798 --> 01:33:52,366
I never got that chance.

1309
01:33:52,399 --> 01:33:56,337
Collateral damage, chaos, death.

1310
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:57,938
This is your legacy.

1311
01:33:57,972 --> 01:33:59,206
I'm your legacy.

1312
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:01,008
You know what
I can't figure out?

1313
01:34:01,041 --> 01:34:04,979
How someone born so rich

1314
01:34:05,012 --> 01:34:08,415
chooses the poorest path
through life.

1315
01:34:08,449 --> 01:34:10,284
You got no honor.

1316
01:34:10,317 --> 01:34:14,054
Without honor,
you got no family.

1317
01:34:15,289 --> 01:34:17,091
And without family...

1318
01:34:19,226 --> 01:34:21,262
...you've got nothing.

1319
01:34:21,295 --> 01:34:23,230
I have nothing because of you.

1320
01:34:23,264 --> 01:34:25,799
My future. My family.

1321
01:34:25,833 --> 01:34:28,335
You stole that from me.

1322
01:34:28,369 --> 01:34:31,172
And now I'm gonna break yours,

1323
01:34:31,205 --> 01:34:33,841
piece by piece.

1324
01:34:33,874 --> 01:34:36,210
Stop talking and face me.

1325
01:34:36,243 --> 01:34:37,778
Do you like surprises, Dommy?

1326
01:34:37,811 --> 01:34:40,681
I adore them.

1327
01:34:42,216 --> 01:34:43,817
But the game's not over yet.

1328
01:34:43,851 --> 01:34:46,086
There's still
so many people to hurt.

1329
01:34:48,856 --> 01:34:50,791
I'm coming for you.

1330
01:34:50,824 --> 01:34:53,060
Well, that's gonna be
hard to do in handcuffs.

1331
01:34:53,093 --> 01:34:55,196
Okay, bye, Dommy.

1332
01:34:55,229 --> 01:34:57,131
No, you hang up first.

1333
01:34:57,164 --> 01:34:58,265
Okay.

1334
01:35:08,543 --> 01:35:09,944
Toretto, freeze.

1335
01:35:09,977 --> 01:35:12,780
Time to face the music, Dom.

1336
01:35:12,813 --> 01:35:15,182
You're playing
right into his hands, cop.

1337
01:35:50,951 --> 01:35:54,088
Okay. Come on.

1338
01:35:56,090 --> 01:35:57,825
Oh.

1339
01:36:00,562 --> 01:36:02,196
Yeah.

1340
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:14,542
Great.

1341
01:36:14,576 --> 01:36:17,011
Just great.

1342
01:36:17,044 --> 01:36:18,912
Shit.

1343
01:36:25,386 --> 01:36:27,955
Little chilly?

1344
01:36:29,323 --> 01:36:30,592
Your plan still sucks.

1345
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:33,360
Maybe, but at least
you'll be warm.

1346
01:36:34,428 --> 01:36:37,331
"Thank you, Cipher. Thank you."

1347
01:36:46,206 --> 01:36:47,308
Oh, wow.

1348
01:36:47,341 --> 01:36:48,610
Take a look at this.

1349
01:36:48,643 --> 01:36:50,444
This should cover us
in the gear department.

1350
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:52,212
You are not to be trusted.

1351
01:36:52,246 --> 01:36:56,050
Hey, you ain't
on my Christmas list either.

1352
01:36:58,118 --> 01:37:00,522
Nothing here is for free.
Let me be clear on that.

1353
01:37:00,555 --> 01:37:02,323
Make sure you get a receipt
from him, okay?

1354
01:37:02,356 --> 01:37:03,625
I'd love to see that.

1355
01:37:03,658 --> 01:37:05,326
Well, I guess Bowie

1356
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:07,461
wasn't entirely worthless.
I can use his hard drive

1357
01:37:07,494 --> 01:37:08,996
to complete our trace of Dante.

1358
01:37:09,029 --> 01:37:11,398
He's been ten moves ahead of us
this whole time.

1359
01:37:11,432 --> 01:37:12,966
How does he do it by himself?

1360
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,502
Uh, this isn't good.

1361
01:37:14,536 --> 01:37:17,004
Our money, it's been split into
accounts all over the world.

1362
01:37:17,037 --> 01:37:19,139
And look
who they're registered to.

1363
01:37:19,173 --> 01:37:21,909
Those are mercenary kill teams.
Real scum.

1364
01:37:21,942 --> 01:37:23,545
He used our money
to buy an army.

1365
01:37:23,578 --> 01:37:25,547
So this guy doesn't
just want us dead.

1366
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:27,014
He wants to erase us
off the planet.

1367
01:37:27,047 --> 01:37:28,382
He's trying to tear us apart.

1368
01:37:28,415 --> 01:37:30,451
That's exactly why we need
to link back up with Dom

1369
01:37:30,484 --> 01:37:32,853
at the rendezvous point.

1370
01:37:35,989 --> 01:37:37,458
You need to see this.

1371
01:37:39,527 --> 01:37:41,228
They've been paid to target us

1372
01:37:41,261 --> 01:37:44,865
and anyone who ever helped us
until now.

1373
01:37:47,468 --> 01:37:49,136
Mum.

1374
01:38:11,559 --> 01:38:13,927
I'll have transport
waiting for you.

1375
01:38:13,961 --> 01:38:16,130
And where are you going?

1376
01:38:16,163 --> 01:38:17,965
I'm gonna dig some graves.

1377
01:38:28,576 --> 01:38:30,277
<i>Mr. Nobody's golden boy,</i>

1378
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:32,413
<i>caught without</i>
<i>so much as a fight.</i>

1379
01:38:32,446 --> 01:38:34,148
That's no fun.

1380
01:38:34,181 --> 01:38:36,016
It's like going
all the way to Everest

1381
01:38:36,049 --> 01:38:37,652
and taking the elevator.

1382
01:38:39,453 --> 01:38:40,954
You might want to buckle up.

1383
01:38:40,988 --> 01:38:44,091
I know you did some good work
for the agency.

1384
01:38:44,124 --> 01:38:46,994
I'm sure you figured
that buys you some leniency.

1385
01:38:47,027 --> 01:38:49,029
But it's a new day.

1386
01:38:49,062 --> 01:38:52,332
That's the problem nowadays.
Nobody listens.

1387
01:38:55,603 --> 01:38:58,338
You should have spent less time
with your head under the hood

1388
01:38:58,372 --> 01:39:00,675
and more time preparing
for what's coming.

1389
01:39:00,708 --> 01:39:03,310
Spies have been replaced
by satellites,

1390
01:39:03,343 --> 01:39:08,315
fighter pilots by drones,
intelligence by an algorithm.

1391
01:39:08,348 --> 01:39:11,051
The days where one man
behind the wheel of a car

1392
01:39:11,084 --> 01:39:13,755
can make a difference
are over, Dom.

1393
01:39:13,788 --> 01:39:16,591
Hell, the days of any man

1394
01:39:16,624 --> 01:39:18,560
behind the wheel of a car
are over.

1395
01:39:21,763 --> 01:39:23,030
What are you doing?

1396
01:39:23,063 --> 01:39:25,499
Preparing for what's to come.

1397
01:39:25,533 --> 01:39:27,468
Right.

1398
01:39:45,385 --> 01:39:46,453
Go. Go. Go.

1399
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:07,642
Dominic, I brought you back
to where we first met.

1400
01:40:07,675 --> 01:40:09,443
And I have a surprise for you.

1401
01:40:35,803 --> 01:40:37,204
Dom!

1402
01:40:38,372 --> 01:40:40,374
I'm listening now.

1403
01:41:14,474 --> 01:41:15,643
Dominic?

1404
01:41:15,677 --> 01:41:17,110
Dominic!

1405
01:41:17,144 --> 01:41:18,780
Would you stop hurting
my new friends?

1406
01:41:18,813 --> 01:41:21,481
No. I'm only here to hurt you.

1407
01:41:21,516 --> 01:41:22,517
Oh.

1408
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:25,185
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1409
01:41:25,218 --> 01:41:26,688
That little car stunt
you just did?

1410
01:41:26,721 --> 01:41:27,722
That was pretty awesome.

1411
01:41:27,755 --> 01:41:29,156
Wasn't it?

1412
01:41:29,189 --> 01:41:30,424
It was so cool.

1413
01:41:30,457 --> 01:41:32,594
But if you don't stop,

1414
01:41:32,627 --> 01:41:35,663
I'm gonna cut her everywhere.

1415
01:41:35,697 --> 01:41:37,264
Badly.

1416
01:41:42,604 --> 01:41:44,271
There she is.

1417
01:41:44,304 --> 01:41:46,641
-Hmm.
-Fashionably late.

1418
01:41:47,609 --> 01:41:49,142
You got me.

1419
01:41:49,844 --> 01:41:51,813
Mmm.

1420
01:41:51,846 --> 01:41:54,348
Off you go.

1421
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:57,619
Family.

1422
01:41:59,954 --> 01:42:03,123
Will you please get off my car?

1423
01:42:04,859 --> 01:42:06,628
Hmm.

1424
01:42:06,661 --> 01:42:08,495
That is so disrespectful.

1425
01:42:08,529 --> 01:42:10,330
You talk too much.

1426
01:42:23,945 --> 01:42:25,312
Stop, stop!

1427
01:42:25,345 --> 01:42:26,681
You don't know
your own strength.

1428
01:42:30,652 --> 01:42:32,252
You butthole!

1429
01:42:32,285 --> 01:42:34,421
Oh, hey.

1430
01:42:35,556 --> 01:42:37,558
Do you like ballet?

1431
01:42:37,592 --> 01:42:38,860
I adore <i>Swan Lake.</i>

1432
01:42:38,893 --> 01:42:41,194
I feel like you're more of a--
kind of a <i>Nutcracker</i> guy.

1433
01:42:41,228 --> 01:42:44,264
And a one, and a two,
and...

1434
01:42:45,933 --> 01:42:47,602
No!

1435
01:42:53,775 --> 01:42:55,409
Wait for it.

1436
01:42:57,879 --> 01:42:59,547
Oh, no.

1437
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:02,382
She's in peril.
What will you do?

1438
01:43:04,351 --> 01:43:06,286
You know what your problem is?

1439
01:43:07,722 --> 01:43:10,490
Family.

1440
01:43:11,592 --> 01:43:13,326
You can't save 'em all.

1441
01:43:14,562 --> 01:43:17,464
Five. Four.

1442
01:43:17,497 --> 01:43:18,733
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta.

1443
01:43:18,766 --> 01:43:20,367
Go on.

1444
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,636
Two.

1445
01:43:33,648 --> 01:43:35,449
You don't like ballet.

1446
01:43:35,482 --> 01:43:37,018
I can feel it.

1447
01:43:37,051 --> 01:43:38,986
May I please have the God's Eye?

1448
01:43:39,020 --> 01:43:40,688
-Screw you.
-No?

1449
01:43:40,722 --> 01:43:41,756
Pretty please?

1450
01:43:43,323 --> 01:43:44,592
Oh, there it is.

1451
01:43:44,625 --> 01:43:46,761
Ooh. Gotcha.

1452
01:43:47,762 --> 01:43:49,931
Good trade. Keep the car.

1453
01:43:49,964 --> 01:43:51,766
Oh, Dommy!

1454
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:57,038
I told you,
you owe me suffering!

1455
01:43:57,071 --> 01:43:59,640
Your legacy isn't money or power

1456
01:43:59,674 --> 01:44:02,043
or the family you built
or the life you led.

1457
01:44:02,076 --> 01:44:05,345
It's the life you made.

1458
01:44:05,378 --> 01:44:08,750
And a father and his son...

1459
01:44:08,783 --> 01:44:09,984
is everything.

1460
01:44:10,017 --> 01:44:12,285
You killed my father
on this bridge.

1461
01:44:12,319 --> 01:44:15,857
And now I know
where to find your son.

1462
01:44:17,759 --> 01:44:20,260
<i>Enchanté.</i>

1463
01:44:29,402 --> 01:44:32,673
You're gonna be okay, Tess.
It went clear through.

1464
01:44:32,707 --> 01:44:34,008
Kinda hurts.

1465
01:44:34,041 --> 01:44:36,043
Your father would be proud.

1466
01:44:36,077 --> 01:44:38,045
Yeah.

1467
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:40,648
You will stop him.

1468
01:44:41,949 --> 01:44:43,551
Have faith.

1469
01:44:54,962 --> 01:44:56,597
She needs a hospital.

1470
01:44:56,631 --> 01:44:58,533
Mm.

1471
01:45:17,819 --> 01:45:19,821
You're gonna be okay.

1472
01:45:19,854 --> 01:45:21,421
I got her.

1473
01:45:21,454 --> 01:45:22,890
Go save your son.

1474
01:45:24,091 --> 01:45:26,359
My nephew.

1475
01:45:39,507 --> 01:45:43,144
I'm not gonna say I'm sorry,
so let me do you one better.

1476
01:45:43,177 --> 01:45:45,613
Let's get your son.

1477
01:46:17,678 --> 01:46:19,881
So, it used to be an old mine,

1478
01:46:19,914 --> 01:46:22,683
and they blasted tunnels
deep into the mountain.

1479
01:46:22,717 --> 01:46:25,887
And I just, uh...

1480
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,521
repurposed the place.

1481
01:46:27,555 --> 01:46:29,790
You just got to keep yourself
open to possibilities.

1482
01:46:29,824 --> 01:46:33,094
And, of course, have
a lot of time on your hands.

1483
01:46:33,127 --> 01:46:35,730
You said we'd meet him here.

1484
01:46:40,835 --> 01:46:41,903
Hey.

1485
01:46:43,738 --> 01:46:44,538
You know your dad.

1486
01:46:44,572 --> 01:46:46,874
He's got to make it safe.

1487
01:46:46,908 --> 01:46:48,542
We'll just wait.

1488
01:46:50,945 --> 01:46:53,848
I love you, Uncle Jakob.

1489
01:47:01,789 --> 01:47:02,657
What's that?

1490
01:47:02,690 --> 01:47:06,127
That? Ah, project
I've been working on.

1491
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:08,562
You wouldn't be interested.

1492
01:47:20,241 --> 01:47:22,810
All right, we're entering
Portuguese airspace.

1493
01:47:22,843 --> 01:47:25,546
Jakob's already there.
Any word from Dom?

1494
01:47:27,782 --> 01:47:29,684
Hey.

1495
01:47:29,717 --> 01:47:31,852
Why are you so quiet?
You all right?

1496
01:47:31,886 --> 01:47:34,255
Just been sitting here
thinking, man.

1497
01:47:34,288 --> 01:47:35,790
I knew I smelled
something burning in here.

1498
01:47:35,823 --> 01:47:39,994
Tej, it was my mission,
y'all took my lead,

1499
01:47:40,027 --> 01:47:42,830
and I messed this thing up
every step of the way.

1500
01:47:42,863 --> 01:47:45,599
I guess this whole...

1501
01:47:45,633 --> 01:47:47,702
leadership thing
really ain't for me.

1502
01:47:47,735 --> 01:47:50,738
You took us to London
on a container.

1503
01:47:50,771 --> 01:47:53,874
You spent thousands of dollars
of your own cash,

1504
01:47:53,908 --> 01:47:55,776
strapped to your ass,

1505
01:47:55,810 --> 01:47:58,512
that now smells like
cheap cologne.

1506
01:47:58,546 --> 01:48:00,514
Now you're sitting here
taking sole responsibility

1507
01:48:00,548 --> 01:48:02,616
for something that we all wear.

1508
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:04,251
Yeah, I know. It sounds stupid.

1509
01:48:04,285 --> 01:48:05,686
Nah, it don't sound stupid
at all.

1510
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:07,088
You know what
it sounds like to me?

1511
01:48:07,121 --> 01:48:09,690
That sounds like a leader.

1512
01:48:18,632 --> 01:48:20,868
Come on, man.
Get your ass up, man.

1513
01:48:22,136 --> 01:48:24,138
I love you, man.

1514
01:48:24,171 --> 01:48:25,606
I love you, too, bro.

1515
01:48:25,639 --> 01:48:28,642
Sometimes we got to say,
"I'm sorry."

1516
01:48:28,676 --> 01:48:30,277
I'm sorry for
whupping your ass, man,

1517
01:48:30,311 --> 01:48:32,146
'cause I didn't really mean
to do that.

1518
01:48:32,179 --> 01:48:34,148
The whole thing, it would've
been a whole dif...

1519
01:48:34,181 --> 01:48:36,250
You okay? What's wrong?

1520
01:48:36,283 --> 01:48:38,619
I'm just allergic
to your bullshit.

1521
01:48:38,652 --> 01:48:40,087
Come on.

1522
01:48:43,657 --> 01:48:46,127
Hey, go easy there.
You're gonna break that thing.

1523
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:48,029
You all right?

1524
01:48:48,062 --> 01:48:49,730
God's Eye was just used to send

1525
01:48:49,764 --> 01:48:51,799
dozens of mercenaries
after Dom's son.

1526
01:48:51,832 --> 01:48:56,604
Something I created
hurting the people we love.

1527
01:48:59,206 --> 01:49:01,142
It was meant to help.

1528
01:49:01,175 --> 01:49:03,611
This is bigger than just Dante.

1529
01:49:03,644 --> 01:49:05,613
This is bigger than just us.

1530
01:49:05,646 --> 01:49:08,549
We have to stop
this monster now.

1531
01:49:22,296 --> 01:49:23,831
We got to go.

1532
01:49:45,086 --> 01:49:46,287
Hold on!

1533
01:49:55,963 --> 01:49:57,965
I got eyes on
Uncle Muscle and the kid.

1534
01:49:57,998 --> 01:50:00,101
All right, everybody,
remember the plan.

1535
01:50:00,134 --> 01:50:02,336
Contain and kidnap. Thank you.

1536
01:50:02,369 --> 01:50:04,138
No.

1537
01:50:04,171 --> 01:50:05,306
No guns.

1538
01:50:05,339 --> 01:50:07,675
I need this little shit alive.

1539
01:50:07,708 --> 01:50:09,143
At least for a while.

1540
01:50:38,772 --> 01:50:40,975
-You ready?
-Ready.

1541
01:50:57,992 --> 01:50:59,693
Holy sh...

1542
01:51:00,261 --> 01:51:01,896
Oh, no, you're good.
You're good.

1543
01:51:01,929 --> 01:51:04,331
Okay, uh, song lyrics,
stubbed toes and cannon cars.

1544
01:51:04,365 --> 01:51:05,799
Yeah.

1545
01:51:10,137 --> 01:51:11,939
Here we go!

1546
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:05,059
It's stuck. It's stuck.

1547
01:52:08,429 --> 01:52:09,830
They got an army
down there, Dom.

1548
01:52:09,863 --> 01:52:11,832
Your team's not far out.

1549
01:52:11,865 --> 01:52:13,801
-Bring us down.
-I can't put her down here.

1550
01:52:13,834 --> 01:52:15,503
There's an airfield
seven klicks west.

1551
01:52:15,537 --> 01:52:17,838
Okay, we'll meet you there.
Now open the back.

1552
01:52:17,871 --> 01:52:20,808
Dom, there's really
nowhere to land.

1553
01:52:22,376 --> 01:52:24,878
Who said anything about landing?

1554
01:52:42,229 --> 01:52:44,031
Look.

1555
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:51,939
I'm coming for you, son.

1556
01:53:01,148 --> 01:53:02,383
What the...

1557
01:53:32,614 --> 01:53:34,616
-Dad!
-Hey, son.

1558
01:53:34,649 --> 01:53:36,584
Good to see you, big bro.

1559
01:53:36,618 --> 01:53:39,353
Good to see you guys.
Follow me to that plane.

1560
01:53:39,386 --> 01:53:41,188
We're right behind you.

1561
01:53:43,591 --> 01:53:45,259
I got you now.

1562
01:53:53,367 --> 01:53:55,102
Aimes, we're on our way.

1563
01:53:55,135 --> 01:53:58,072
Dom, I'll be touching down
five klicks west.

1564
01:53:58,105 --> 01:53:59,840
But they're still on your tail.

1565
01:54:01,475 --> 01:54:03,143
It's jammed.

1566
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:09,517
B, what are you doing?

1567
01:54:11,553 --> 01:54:13,120
Careful.

1568
01:54:14,589 --> 01:54:16,123
Okay, okay, okay.

1569
01:54:24,532 --> 01:54:27,401
Shut the front door.

1570
01:54:27,434 --> 01:54:29,036
Little B.

1571
01:54:35,943 --> 01:54:38,278
Uncle Jakob!

1572
01:54:38,312 --> 01:54:40,280
I fixed it!

1573
01:54:45,319 --> 01:54:46,588
B!

1574
01:54:46,621 --> 01:54:48,255
Toodle-oo.

1575
01:54:50,057 --> 01:54:51,458
-Help!
-Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta. Shut up.

1576
01:54:51,492 --> 01:54:52,694
Damn it.

1577
01:54:52,727 --> 01:54:54,962
You party? I party.

1578
01:54:54,995 --> 01:54:56,897
Whoa.

1579
01:54:57,699 --> 01:55:00,401
Dom, I lost him.
Dante has Little B.

1580
01:55:20,053 --> 01:55:22,289
Hey, Dominic.
Welcome to the big showdown.

1581
01:55:22,322 --> 01:55:24,659
It's the last lap.
Check out my copilot.

1582
01:55:24,692 --> 01:55:27,529
-Dad!
-Who could've seen this coming?

1583
01:55:27,562 --> 01:55:29,430
I mean, you know, except for me.

1584
01:55:46,614 --> 01:55:49,316
Shit. Looks like
my fuel line's been shot.

1585
01:55:50,417 --> 01:55:53,688
-I can't get to him, Dom.
-Jakob, stay with me.

1586
01:55:53,721 --> 01:55:56,356
I'm out of this race.

1587
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:57,725
It has to be you.

1588
01:55:57,759 --> 01:56:01,094
Hey, Dom!
Got a little surprise for you.

1589
01:56:10,805 --> 01:56:13,373
You raised a hell of a son, Dom.

1590
01:56:13,407 --> 01:56:16,477
Time for me to step out
from under your shadow.

1591
01:56:17,512 --> 01:56:19,346
Thanks for showing me the light.

1592
01:56:19,379 --> 01:56:20,615
Jakob?

1593
01:56:20,648 --> 01:56:22,182
<i>I'm gonna go clear the way.</i>

1594
01:56:23,484 --> 01:56:25,486
Go get your son.

1595
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:26,788
Jakob, don't!

1596
01:56:26,821 --> 01:56:29,056
Don't!

1597
01:56:37,665 --> 01:56:39,266
Uncle Jakob!

1598
01:57:03,525 --> 01:57:06,661
Looks like Uncle Muscle won't be
coming to the next barbecue.

1599
01:57:06,694 --> 01:57:08,763
Oh.

1600
01:57:08,796 --> 01:57:10,464
I mean, it's very honorable.

1601
01:57:12,099 --> 01:57:14,268
Three miles away.
Take the service road.

1602
01:57:14,301 --> 01:57:16,036
It'll lead you
right to the airfield.

1603
01:57:27,381 --> 01:57:30,183
You know how to beat your dad
in a street race?

1604
01:57:37,559 --> 01:57:38,793
Take away the streets.

1605
01:57:38,826 --> 01:57:40,595
Dad!

1606
01:57:46,501 --> 01:57:48,402
Amazing.

1607
01:57:48,435 --> 01:57:49,469
Oh.

1608
01:58:02,784 --> 01:58:05,385
We got it.
We got it.

1609
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:14,361
My turn.

1610
01:58:38,653 --> 01:58:41,321
He's good. Your dad's good.

1611
01:58:46,393 --> 01:58:47,895
Dom, you got one mile left.

1612
01:58:47,929 --> 01:58:51,164
Son, I never break a promise.

1613
01:58:51,198 --> 01:58:54,535
Now, let's finish
that driving lesson.

1614
01:58:54,569 --> 01:58:55,937
Feel the car,

1615
01:58:55,970 --> 01:58:57,805
find your line

1616
01:58:57,839 --> 01:58:59,373
and fly.

1617
01:59:20,561 --> 01:59:21,562
Oh!

1618
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:38,178
Now!

1619
01:59:51,693 --> 01:59:52,727
No.

1620
01:59:54,829 --> 01:59:55,963
Take the service road now.

1621
02:00:04,404 --> 02:00:06,339
-I'm wheels down.
-We're headed to you now.

1622
02:00:06,373 --> 02:00:08,341
Your team is on their way.

1623
02:00:08,375 --> 02:00:09,911
I'll meet you at the airfield.

1624
02:00:09,944 --> 02:00:12,013
-You okay?
-I'm good, Dad.

1625
02:00:12,046 --> 02:00:14,481
I'm real proud of you, son.

1626
02:00:59,794 --> 02:01:02,029
Oh, Dommy boy.

1627
02:01:02,063 --> 02:01:03,931
It's so good to see you again.

1628
02:01:03,965 --> 02:01:06,567
Did you hit me with
a helicopter back there?

1629
02:01:06,601 --> 02:01:07,935
Hmm.

1630
02:01:07,969 --> 02:01:10,671
Ow, you big brute.
I mean, I get it.

1631
02:01:10,705 --> 02:01:13,007
You're showing off
in front of your son.

1632
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:14,509
But honestly,
did you really think

1633
02:01:14,542 --> 02:01:17,512
it was going to be that easy?

1634
02:01:17,545 --> 02:01:19,847
You're exactly
where I wanted you to be.

1635
02:01:19,881 --> 02:01:21,783
Yes.

1636
02:01:21,816 --> 02:01:23,651
Wait for it.

1637
02:01:23,684 --> 02:01:25,853
I got a surprise for you.

1638
02:01:32,627 --> 02:01:35,395
The cavalry's here.
We got you, Dom.

1639
02:01:36,564 --> 02:01:38,699
Roman, get out of here.
It's a trap.

1640
02:01:42,603 --> 02:01:43,905
Incoming!

1641
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:00,621
Yes!

1642
02:02:01,689 --> 02:02:04,391
See, that's the problem
with having a big family.

1643
02:02:07,829 --> 02:02:09,630
Can't protect 'em all.

1644
02:02:14,869 --> 02:02:16,070
Ooh!

1645
02:02:16,103 --> 02:02:18,573
Oh, Dominic,
is that your new friend?

1646
02:02:19,140 --> 02:02:20,842
Aw.

1647
02:02:20,875 --> 02:02:22,577
You are so predictable.

1648
02:02:22,610 --> 02:02:25,913
You think everyone's gonna
end up on your side?

1649
02:02:25,947 --> 02:02:29,116
Problem is Aimes was mine first.

1650
02:02:29,150 --> 02:02:32,620
Now the work begins.

1651
02:02:32,653 --> 02:02:34,121
And in there,

1652
02:02:34,155 --> 02:02:37,357
today we'll put our family
on a path to real power.

1653
02:02:38,759 --> 02:02:39,827
Let's get started.

1654
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:50,872
Well, looks like
our partnership's

1655
02:02:50,905 --> 02:02:53,373
off to a fantastic start.

1656
02:02:56,177 --> 02:02:58,980
You know, Dominic,
to become a real saint,

1657
02:02:59,013 --> 02:03:00,781
you have to perform miracles.

1658
02:03:00,815 --> 02:03:02,884
Or die a martyr.

1659
02:03:02,917 --> 02:03:04,952
So what's it gonna be?

1660
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:17,031
I took your money,
I took your freedom,

1661
02:03:17,064 --> 02:03:19,000
and I'm gonna take your family.

1662
02:03:19,834 --> 02:03:21,168
And you're gonna die

1663
02:03:21,202 --> 02:03:23,537
knowing that
you couldn't save your son.

1664
02:03:26,207 --> 02:03:28,175
Dad.

1665
02:03:28,209 --> 02:03:30,410
I have faith.

1666
02:03:37,818 --> 02:03:40,588
You made one mistake.

1667
02:03:41,488 --> 02:03:43,658
You never took my car.

1668
02:04:03,911 --> 02:04:04,979
Oh!

1669
02:06:03,397 --> 02:06:05,166
The suffering is over, Dom.

1670
02:06:10,704 --> 02:06:12,940
It's time for you to die.

1671
02:07:12,166 --> 02:07:14,201
No way.

1672
02:07:15,302 --> 02:07:17,037
Still think my plan sucks?

1673
02:10:39,073 --> 02:10:40,608
Howdy, partner.

1674
02:10:40,642 --> 02:10:42,943
Do you like surprises?

1675
02:10:42,976 --> 02:10:46,280
You've done some dastardly,
dirty deeds, Sheriff.

1676
02:10:46,313 --> 02:10:49,483
You took the most important
thing in my life from me.

1677
02:10:56,624 --> 02:10:58,959
<i>Dom drove the car.</i>

1678
02:10:59,561 --> 02:11:02,296
<i>-But you...</i>
-Help me.

1679
02:11:02,329 --> 02:11:04,932
<i>...you pulled the trigger.</i>

1680
02:11:06,133 --> 02:11:08,001
And now I'm gonna
make you suffer.

1681
02:11:23,718 --> 02:11:27,655
The devil is coming for you...

1682
02:11:27,689 --> 02:11:30,257
lawman.

1683
02:11:30,290 --> 02:11:34,629
Well, I ain't hard to find,
you sumbitch.
