1
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:57,402
父亲愿意为儿子做任何事。
There is nothing a father wouldn't do for his son.

2
00:00:57,402 --> 00:01:00,129
你妈妈从来都不明白。
Your mother never understood this.

3
00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:02,890
她看着你，把你当成了怪物。
She looked at you and saw a monster.

4
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,065
我看到了潜力。
I saw potential.

5
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:08,551
当一个恶霸拿走了你的钱，你就拿走了他的眼睛。
When a bully took your money, you took his eye.

6
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:12,175
他们说你疯了，你就把他们的舌头割了。
When they called you crazy, you took their tongues.

7
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:14,833
但今天是我带你来的。
But I brought you here today.

8
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,524
是慷慨吗?
Was it generosity?

9
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:18,630
爱吗?
Love?

10
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,976
不。
No.

11
00:01:19,976 --> 00:01:22,599
这样我创造的东西就不会随我而去。
It's so what I built doesn't die with me.

12
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:24,360
这样我的遗产才能流传下去，
So my legacy can live on,

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,535
因为父亲和儿子就是一切。
because a father and his son is everything.

14
00:01:27,535 --> 00:01:30,055
我有一份只能托付给一个人的工作。
I have a job that I can only trust with one man.

15
00:01:30,055 --> 00:01:31,574
你。
You.

16
00:01:31,574 --> 00:01:34,508
我手下最残忍的士兵在监视我们的金库，
My most ruthless soldiers were watching our cash houses,

17
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:37,752
他们让这个多米尼克·托雷托烧了我的东西
and they let this Dominic Toretto burn what is mine.

18
00:01:37,752 --> 00:01:39,478
我会杀了多米尼克·托雷托。
I'll kill Dominic Toretto.

19
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:41,963
我要把他们都杀了。
I'll kill 'em all.

20
00:01:41,963 --> 00:01:44,552
杀了他们?你会宽恕他们吗?
Kill them? You'd show them mercy?

21
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:45,933
不，我的儿子。
No, my son.

22
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:50,351
当你欠下痛苦时，永远不要接受死亡作为回报。
When suffering is owed, never accept death as a payment.

23
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,736
让托雷托吃苦头。
Make Toretto suffer.

24
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,893
现在工作开始了。
Now the work begins.

25
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:16,619
在那里，
And in there,

26
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:20,450
今天我们要让我们的家族走上真正的权力之路。
today we'll put our family on a path to real power.

27
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,626
让我们开始吧。
Let's get started.

28
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,429

00:04:46,976 --> 00:04:48,357
嘿，他们人太多了!
Hey, there's too many of them!

30
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:50,186
-我们去不了了-你说得对。我们没有。
- We're not gonna make it. - You're right. We aren't.

31
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:52,326
-你是。-不，我不会离开你的
- You are. - No, I'm not leaving you.

32
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:54,121
现在，你按照计划去做。
Now, you stick with the plan.

33
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:55,812
这一直都是计划。
It was always the plan.

小B和我一起建的。

小个子会比我们所有人都好

到他12岁的时候。

我是说，这才是重点，不是吗?

罗曼问他是否可以领导这次任务。

00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:20,325
但你知道我不能让他们独自去罗马。

我会从你是谁说起。

一个大多数人一辈子都无法回答的问题。

在你在我沙发上失血过多之前，

因为你要么和我在一起，要么…

269
00:18:59,828 --> 00:19:01,243
我和别人玩得不好。
I don't play well with others.

270
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:03,176
那你就得看着你最爱的人死去。

271

你看着的是我最爱的人。

我们把他们都变成恐怖分子了吗?

他们的照片已被提交给当局。

454

好了，鲍勃!我得去杀了那个混蛋
All right, Bob! I got to go kill that jerk

455
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:16,900
那是在拆除我的炸弹。

总有事情发生，你知道吗?哦。

00:36:07,303 --> 00:36:09,305
我们现在就得堵住引爆器。
We need to jam the detonator now.

474
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:11,548
我知道了，我知道了。蕾蒂，别跟丢了。
I got it, I got it. Letty, don't lose him.

475
00:36:13,585 --> 00:36:15,587
我可以锁定你的位置并传送
I can lock on to your location and transmit

通过手机的蜂窝干扰。
cellular interference through your phone.

477
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:19,901
这样能干扰他的引爆器，为我们争取时间。
That should jam his detonator and buy us some time.

478
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,975
莱蒂。
Letty.

479
00:37:07,604 --> 00:37:08,950
万岁!
Bravo!

480
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,297
伙计们，这很棘手。
It's getting tricky, guys.

481
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:12,160
我不能再盯着他了。
I can't stay on him for much longer.

482
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,059
拉姆齐，那条河有多深?
Ramsey, how deep is that river?

483
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:16,164
台伯河吗?嗯…
The Tiber? Uh...

呃，60英尺。
Uh, 60 feet.

485
00:37:17,614 --> 00:37:19,202
我是说，水可能会窒息爆炸，
I mean, the water could smother the explosion,

486
00:37:19,202 --> 00:37:21,411
也许可以把它的功率降低十倍。
reduce its power by ten times, maybe.

487
00:37:37,393 --> 00:37:39,567
该死的!
Damn it!

488
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:43,606
你太想我了，宝贝!
You missed me by that much, baby!

489

我跟丢了他。他走了。

我们找不到他了。
He's out of our reach.

00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:53,581
我们不能再干扰信号了。
We can't jam the signal anymore.

坏消息，多姆。我又回来了。

我的前任，无名先生，看到了潜力，
My predecessor, Mr. Nobody, saw potential,

560
00:42:12,115 --> 00:42:14,497
于是他招募了他们，当然是自由职业者。
so he recruited them-- freelance, of course.

561
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:16,637
他们在阿布扎比为我们执行任务，

东京，伦敦，纽约，第比利斯。

要我说，我们几年前就该断绝关系，

564
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:24,024
但他们有自己的冠军。

572

What's your point?

575
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:45,424
重点是他们是罪犯。
Point is they're criminals.

576
00:42:45,424 --> 00:42:47,185
罗马只是个时间问题。
Rome was a matter of time.

他们偷了上亿美元
They've stolen hundreds of millions of dollars

578
00:42:48,876 --> 00:42:52,190
以及至少一艘核潜艇。
and at least one nuclear sub.

579
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,918
真正的问题是:我们怎么能让这种情况持续这么久?
The real question is: How did we let this go on so long?

580
00:42:55,918 --> 00:42:58,472
这个家族为了保持我们的清白不惜弄脏自己的手。
This family has gotten their hands dirty to keep ours clean.

581
00:42:58,472 --> 00:43:02,303
他们为了这个机构去了地狱之门又回来了。
They've driven to the gates of hell and back for this agency.

582
00:43:02,303 --> 00:43:04,202
罗马有些地方不对劲。
Something is not right with Rome.

583
00:43:04,202 --> 00:43:05,341
这不可能。
It can't be.

584
00:43:05,341 --> 00:43:07,688
它可以，也确实如此。
It can and it is.

585
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:09,517
该机构比这要好。
The agency is better than this.

586
00:43:09,517 --> 00:43:10,967
我们比这更聪明。
We are smarter than this.

587
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:12,659
我们应该支持多姆和他的家人。
We should be standing with Dom and his family.

588
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:14,177
这是我们能做的最起码的事。
That is the very least that we can do.

589
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:15,972
如果我们不采取行动，我们所有人都会受到打击。
If we don't act, this blows back on all of us.

590
00:43:15,972 --> 00:43:18,872
其后果将是存在的。
The fallout will be existential.

591
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:22,945
我要申请完全的授权。
I'm asking for full green-light authority.

592
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:25,568
用任何手段杀死或捕获托雷托家族。

Aimes, what are you doing?

594
00:43:34,301 --> 00:43:36,303
看来是眼睛在作怪。
Looks like the ayes have it.

595
00:43:36,303 --> 00:43:38,098
作为你的顶头上司
As your direct superior,

596
00:43:38,098 --> 00:43:40,721
我才不管别人有多善良，
I don't give a shit about anybody's heart of gold,

597
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:43,655
我讨厌烧烤。
and I hate barbecues.

598
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:46,209
你知道我会让货运火车走土路，
You know I'd make a freight train take a dirt road,

599
00:43:46,209 --> 00:43:49,350
所以别挡我的路。
so do not get in my way.

600
00:43:52,284 --> 00:43:53,872
好吧。
Okay.

601
00:43:57,151 --> 00:43:58,566
我要走我自己的路。
I'll go my own way.

00:44:30,184 --> 00:44:33,463
这可不是什么罗马节日。
Well, it ain't no Roman holiday.

610
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:36,294
你也不是格里高利·派克。

毫米。
Mm.

我的家人吗?
My family?

613
00:44:39,746 --> 00:44:43,508
你的人都躲起来了。他们现在是安全的。
Your team's gone to ground. They're safe for now.

614
00:44:43,508 --> 00:44:46,028
他们抓走了蕾蒂。
They've taken Letty.

615
00:44:47,374 --> 00:44:49,583
-他们是谁?-机构。
- Who's they? - The agency.

616
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:51,378
而你刚刚跃居第一
And you've just shot to number one

617
00:44:51,378 --> 00:44:53,035
在世界头号通缉犯名单上。
on the world's most wanted list.

618
00:44:53,035 --> 00:44:56,521
干这事的人想切断你和中情局的联系
Whoever did this wanted to sever your ties to the agency

619
00:44:56,521 --> 00:44:58,419
把你和家人隔离开来。

620
00:44:58,419 --> 00:45:01,733
任何联系你们的人都会被追踪。
Any attempt to contact your team will be traced.

621
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:04,253
我要你带个口信给无名先生。
I need you to get a message to Mr. Nobody.

622
00:45:04,253 --> 00:45:06,911
你需要一个灵媒或者魔术师。
You'll need a medium for that or a magician.

623
00:45:06,911 --> 00:45:08,947
他已经消失了。
He's done his disappearing act.

624
00:45:08,947 --> 00:45:11,570
把消息传出去。
Just get the message out.

625
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,780
告诉他我准备好要那个比利时人了，
Tell him I'm ready to have that Belgian,

626
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,057
他会知道该去哪里。
and he'll know where to go.

627
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:16,748
我有话要告诉你，宝贝。
I've got a message for you, ducky.

628
00:45:16,748 --> 00:45:20,062
世界着火了，你还想继续逃跑
The world is on fire, and you want to keep running

629
00:45:20,062 --> 00:45:22,443
进入燃烧的大楼去救人，
into the burning building to save lives,

630
00:45:22,443 --> 00:45:25,723
但最终大楼会倒塌在你身上。
but eventually the building's gonna collapse on you.

631
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,414
我不在乎死。
I don't care about dying.

632
00:45:28,587 --> 00:45:32,730
我只关心保护我爱的人。
I only care about protecting the people that I love.

633
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,526
你知道为什么角斗士从来没有家庭吗?
You know why gladiators never had families?

634
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,632
——为什么?-因为他们知道
- Why? - Because they knew

635
00:45:38,632 --> 00:45:41,255
每一天都可能是他们的最后一天。
that every day might be their last.

636
00:45:41,255 --> 00:45:45,466
你选择了一条孤独的路，亲爱的。
You're choosing a lonely way, my darling.

637
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:48,159
不能带任何人一起去。
Can't take anyone with you.

638
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:10,733
让上帝之眼上线。
Bring God's Eye online.

639
00:46:10,733 --> 00:46:12,804
是，长官，启动。
Yes, sir. Initiating.

640
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:14,668
告诉我托雷托和其他人的位置
Get me Toretto and the others' locations

641
00:46:14,668 --> 00:46:16,118
精确到毫米。
to the millimeter.

642
00:46:16,118 --> 00:46:17,809
先生，我们有麻烦了。
Sir, we have a problem.

643
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:19,673
上帝之眼追踪硬件被移除。
The God's Eye tracking hardware has been removed.

644
00:46:19,673 --> 00:46:21,364
苔丝。
Tess.

645
00:46:21,364 --> 00:46:23,815
我猜她的来访不完全是社交拜访。
I guess her visit wasn't purely a social call.

646
00:46:23,815 --> 00:46:25,161
帮我个忙。
Do me a favor.

647
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:27,612
她一出现，我们就看看她去哪了。
She pops up on any grid, let's see where she goes.

648
00:46:27,612 --> 00:46:31,581
至于其他人，我们的逃犯也不是未知数。
As for the rest, our fugitives aren't unknown quantities.

649
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:35,275
托雷托有一个妹妹，一个儿子。
Toretto has a sister, a son.

650
00:46:35,275 --> 00:46:37,587
在我们找到他之前
Until we find him,

651
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:39,279
找到他的家人。
find his family.

652
00:46:58,885 --> 00:47:01,404
哦!
Oh!

653
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:03,199
——再一次。
- Again.

654
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:05,339
哇。
Wow.

655
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:06,996
你是不是背叛了你最喜欢的阿姨?
Are you cheating on-on your favorite auntie?

656
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:09,792
你赢一英寸还是一英里都没关系。
It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile.

657
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:10,931
赢得的胜利。
Winning's winning.

658
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:12,899
我在哪儿听过这句话?
Where have I heard that one before?

659
00:47:15,246 --> 00:47:17,593
走吧!走吧!
Go! Go!

660
00:47:19,077 --> 00:47:21,355
搜索无处不在!我们需要他们活着!
Search everywhere! We need them alive!

661
00:47:26,395 --> 00:47:29,260
趴在地上!趴在地上!
Get on the ground! Get on the ground!

662
00:47:31,469 --> 00:47:33,436
不!米娅!放开她!
No! Mia! Let her go!

663
00:47:38,717 --> 00:47:40,064
快跑!
Run!

664
00:48:06,711 --> 00:48:08,713
-怎么了?-雅各布叔叔?
- What's up? - Uncle Jakob?

665
00:48:08,713 --> 00:48:09,783
你爸爸派我来的。
Your dad sent me.

666
00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:12,613
计划有变。
Change of plans.

667
00:48:31,425 --> 00:48:32,840
不要动!
Don't move!

668
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,981
-我说不许动!
- I said don't move!

669
00:49:15,607 --> 00:49:17,023
你有小B吗?
Do you have Little B?

670
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:19,266
B !
B!

671
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,201
——冻结!
- Freeze!

672
00:49:29,483 --> 00:49:30,553
-你没事吧?-是的。
- You okay? - Yeah.

673
00:49:37,491 --> 00:49:38,665
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

674
00:49:42,427 --> 00:49:44,533
B !
B!

675
00:49:44,533 --> 00:49:46,190
来了,来了。
Come, come.

676
00:49:49,124 --> 00:49:51,126
那些家伙到底是谁?
Who the hell were those guys?

677
00:49:51,126 --> 00:49:54,232
机构。罗马是个陷阱。整个家庭都成了目标。
Agency. Rome was a trap. Whole family's being targeted.

678
00:49:54,232 --> 00:49:55,854
好了，我得去找布莱恩和孩子们…
Okay, I got to get to Brian and the kids...

679
00:49:55,854 --> 00:49:57,132
多姆让我来带走他。
Dom sent me to take him.

680
00:49:57,132 --> 00:49:59,099
记得我们说过要去的地方吗
Remember that place we said we'd go

681
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,342
如果世界变成地狱?
if the world went to hell?

682
00:50:00,342 --> 00:50:02,344
多姆想让团队在那里集合。
Dom wants the team to meet there.

683
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:03,690
是的。
Yeah.

684
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,002
好,看。
Okay, look.

685
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,417
小B，你和雅各布叔叔一起去。
Little B, you're gonna go with Uncle Jakob.

686
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,729
好吧?他说什么你就做什么。是吗?
Okay? You do whatever he says. Yeah?

687
00:50:08,729 --> 00:50:11,594
我带你去找你爸爸。如果你不介意的话。
I'm gonna get you to your dad. If that's okay with you.

688
00:50:12,354 --> 00:50:14,701
用你的生命保护他。
Protect him with your life.

689
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,945
我爱你，杰克。
I love you, Jakey.

690
00:50:17,945 --> 00:50:20,327
我也爱你，姐姐。
I love you, too, sis.

691
00:50:20,327 --> 00:50:22,088
我们开始吧。
Let's do it.

692
00:50:30,406 --> 00:50:33,720
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

693
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:37,965
哟!
Yo!

694
00:50:37,965 --> 00:50:39,795
不是那个。
It's not that one.

695
00:50:39,795 --> 00:50:41,693
就是这个。
It's this one.

696
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,489
是的。
Yep.

697
00:50:46,526 --> 00:50:47,699
等等,但是…
Wait, but...

698
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:49,494

720
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:10,610
奎妮告诉我能在这里找到你。
Queenie told me I could find you here.

721
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:11,956
比利时吗?
Belgian?

722
00:52:11,956 --> 00:52:14,165
无名先生说他有个女儿。
Mr. Nobody said he had a daughter.

723
00:52:14,165 --> 00:52:16,236
他做了吗?
He did?

既然他失踪了
Well, now that he's gone missing,

725
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,931
我从寒冷中走了进来。
I came in from the cold.

726
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:23,795
你爸爸管理着局里。
Your dad kept the agency in line.

727
00:52:23,795 --> 00:52:27,247
现在感觉所有的锚都被切断了。
Now it feels like all the anchors have been cut.

728
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:31,631
在一个没有规则的世界里，没有人是安全的。
In a world where there is no code, no one's safe.

729
00:52:31,631 --> 00:52:33,564
你是对的。
You're right.

730
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:36,843
该机构背弃了它所坚持的一切。
The agency has turned its back on everything it stood for.

731
00:52:36,843 --> 00:52:40,295
新老板艾姆斯，他会带着一切来找你的。
The new boss, Aimes, he's coming for you with everything.

732
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:43,298
我在为你争取时间。
I'm buying you some time.

733
00:52:43,298 --> 00:52:48,475
还借了他们的小追踪器。
And borrowed their, uh, little tracking device thingy.

734
00:52:49,718 --> 00:52:51,029
看起来熟悉吗?
Look familiar?

735
00:52:51,029 --> 00:52:52,410
上帝的眼睛。——嗯。
God's Eye. - Mm-hmm.

736
00:52:52,410 --> 00:52:54,101
我会把它放在保险库里。
I'd put that in a vault somewhere.

737
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:57,657
人们把保险库从墙上拉出来，所以我觉得和我在一起更安全。
People pull vaults out of walls, so I think it's safer with me.

738
00:52:57,657 --> 00:52:59,245
我截取了一个屏幕截图
I pulled a screen grab

739
00:52:59,245 --> 00:53:01,074
他们错过的一段交通监控录像，
off of a traffic cam that they missed,

740
00:53:01,074 --> 00:53:02,765
把它放在上帝的眼睛里。
put it in God's Eye.

741
00:53:02,765 --> 00:53:04,422
在里约发生了一起谋杀案。
There was a hit in Rio.

742
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:07,218
你在里约不会有什么敌人吧?
You wouldn't happen to have any enemies in Rio, would you?

743
00:53:07,218 --> 00:53:09,565
——雷耶斯。-赫南·雷耶斯?
- Reyes. - Hernan Reyes?

744
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:14,467
还没死，但他有个儿子，丹特。
Still pretty dead, but he has a son, Dante.

745
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:18,298
所以你得带我去里约。
So you're gonna have to get me to Rio.

746
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:21,646
这是你的第二个愿望。你还有一个。
That's your second wish. You have one more.

747
00:53:22,613 --> 00:53:23,924
莱蒂。
Letty.

748
00:53:26,927 --> 00:53:30,034
莱蒂被关在地图上没有的秘密监狱里。
Letty's in a black site prison off of every map.

749
00:53:30,034 --> 00:53:31,242
那就把她弄出来。
Then get her out.

750
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:32,899
没有人能做到。
Nobody can.

751
00:53:32,899 --> 00:53:34,763
没有人会。
Nobody would.

752
00:53:34,763 --> 00:53:36,247
多姆，我很抱歉
Dom, I'm so sorry,

753
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:39,630
但你让我做的事是不可能的。
but what you're asking me to do is impossible.

754
00:53:47,293 --> 00:53:49,536
没有什么是不可能的。
Nothing's impossible.

755
00:53:53,057 --> 00:53:54,886
你只需要有信心。
You just have to have faith.

756
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:09,280
把我们藏在集装箱里偷偷带出罗马
Sneaking us out of Rome in a shipping container

757
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,558
满是须后水，这主意太糟糕了，罗曼。
full of aftershave, that was a terrible idea, Roman.

758
00:54:11,558 --> 00:54:14,561
等等，我想我失去了嗅觉。
Wait, I think I lost my sense of smell.

759
00:54:14,561 --> 00:54:16,563
那不是须后水。那是催泪瓦斯。
That is not aftershave. That is tear gas.

760
00:54:16,563 --> 00:54:19,325
伙计，我不知道你们在说什么。
Hey, man, I don't know what y'all are talking about.

761
00:54:19,325 --> 00:54:21,292
你懂我的意思吗?
You know what I mean?

762
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:22,845
我闻到了魔法的味道。
I smell magic.

763
00:54:22,845 --> 00:54:24,226
我给自己拿了一瓶。
I took a bottle for myself.

764
00:54:24,226 --> 00:54:25,917
这都要感谢你。
This is all thanks to you.

765
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:27,471
你知道的，对吧?
You know that, right?

766
00:54:27,471 --> 00:54:29,956
不，你只要跟着我的"尾巴"做"尾巴"就行了
No, see, you just got to follow my "leat" as a "leater."

767
00:54:29,956 --> 00:54:33,787
你明白我的意思吗?我是天生的“皮匠”。
You see what I'm saying? I'm a natural-born "leater."

768
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:35,548
我们在哪里?
Where are we?

769
00:54:35,548 --> 00:54:37,515
我带你回家了，拉姆齐。

-爸爸知道你开这车吗?-他应该。
- Dad know you drive this thing? - He should.

773
00:54:54,429 --> 00:54:55,706
我和他比赛。
I raced him in it.

774
00:54:55,706 --> 00:54:58,502
正如你所知，在90年代，
And just so you know, in the '90s,

775
00:54:58,502 --> 00:55:01,332
如果你的分数是5.0，那就意味着你是那个男人。
if you were rolling in a 5.0, it meant you were the man.

776
00:55:01,332 --> 00:55:04,024
不管你喜不喜欢，它仍然是一个“斯坦”。
Like it or not, it's still a 'Stang.

777
00:55:04,024 --> 00:55:06,751

01:00:51,786 --> 01:00:53,684
穿过城市的球是
The ball through the city was

892
01:00:53,684 --> 01:00:56,376
向我家的保险箱致敬。
a bit of an homage to my family's safe.

893
01:00:56,376 --> 01:00:58,378
除了它着火了。
Except it was on fire.

894
01:01:01,347 --> 01:01:03,590
你还记得我父亲吗?
You remember my father?

895
01:01:03,590 --> 01:01:06,179
——埃尔南·雷耶斯——是的。
- Hernan Reyes. - Yes.

896
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:09,527
我记得他以为他已经掌控了这座城市。
I remember he thought he had his foot on this city's neck.

897
01:01:09,527 --> 01:01:11,081
但你知道发生了什么吗?
But you know what happened?

898
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:13,186
我把他打倒了。
I took him down.

899
01:01:13,186 --> 01:01:16,707
我们不要在孩子们面前争吵。
Let's not argue in front of the children.

900
01:01:16,707 --> 01:01:18,433
你完全正确。
You are absolutely right.

901
01:01:18,433 --> 01:01:21,091
我父亲是个可怕的人
My father was a horrible man,

902
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:23,576
非常坏的爸爸，
very bad daddy,

903
01:01:23,576 --> 01:01:25,371
但我挺喜欢他的
but I kind of liked him.

904
01:01:25,371 --> 01:01:28,098
你偷了我们的钱就把他从我身边夺走了
And you took him from me when you stole our money

905
01:01:28,098 --> 01:01:30,652
留给我们的只有痛苦。
and left us with nothing but suffering.

906
01:01:30,652 --> 01:01:33,655
我就是为这个来的。
Well, that's what I came here for.

907
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:36,313
结束这种痛苦。
To end that suffering.

908
01:01:37,659 --> 01:01:39,488
对了，我没拿那笔钱。
Oh, and I didn't take that money.

909
01:01:42,353 --> 01:01:44,045
我把它烧了。
I burned it.

910
01:01:44,804 --> 01:01:46,633
哦。
Uh-oh.

911
01:01:46,633 --> 01:01:49,602
巴西是我的，
Well, Brazil is mine,

912
01:01:49,602 --> 01:01:51,190
这座城市是我的
and I own this city.

913
01:01:52,605 --> 01:01:54,331
哦。
Ooh.

914
01:01:58,369 --> 01:02:00,889
你们以为什么都能买到。
You people think you can buy everything.

915
01:02:02,891 --> 01:02:04,790
但你买不到街道。
But you can't buy the streets.

916
01:02:09,967 --> 01:02:11,762
我们支持多姆。
We stand with Dom.

917
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:17,319
这太尴尬了。
Well, this is awkward.

918
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:20,598
所以，不如我们开始互相射击吧
So, how about we all just start shooting each other

919
01:02:20,598 --> 01:02:21,599
看看会发生什么?
and see what happens?

920
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,568
或者我们赛跑。
Or we race.

921
01:02:24,568 --> 01:02:26,501
如果你赢了，就带我进去。
If you win, you take me in.

922
01:02:26,501 --> 01:02:27,951
如果你输了……
If you lose...

923
01:02:29,676 --> 01:02:31,782
不要失去。
Don't lose.

924
01:02:31,782 --> 01:02:35,234
你们都来是因为想看比赛。
You all came 'cause you wanted to see a race.

925
01:02:39,169 --> 01:02:40,308

1017
01:08:55,407 --> 01:08:59,652
但我觉得一旦他…

01:08:59,652 --> 01:09:02,483
打碎了我的头骨，也打开了我的思维。

中情局为什么要背弃我们，

如果我们破产了要怎么做?
How are we gonna do that if we broke?

01:16:59,856 --> 01:17:01,099
你们就是为这个来的吗?我的松饼吗?
Is that what you guys came for? My muffins?

1186
01:17:01,099 --> 01:17:02,756
要开个松饼派对吗?
Oh, it's gonna be a muffin party?

1187
01:17:04,033 --> 01:17:06,276
我们，我们需要交通工具。
We, uh, we need transport.

1188
01:17:06,276 --> 01:17:08,451
武器，汽车，工程。
Weapons, cars, the works.

1189
01:17:08,451 --> 01:17:09,866
和安静。
And quietly.

1190
01:17:09,866 --> 01:17:11,592
好吧，那我只需要现金。好吧?
Cool, then I'm just gonna need cash. Okay?

1191
01:17:11,592 --> 01:17:12,938
没有密码之类的东西。
None of that crypto stuff.

1192
01:17:12,938 --> 01:17:15,044
黑杰夫·贝佐斯帮你搞定了。
Oh, the Black Jeff Bezos here got you covered.

1193
01:17:15,044 --> 01:17:17,736
黑色的贝佐斯?-是的，他甚至去过外太空。
Black Bezos? -Yeah, he's even been into outer space.

1194
01:17:17,736 --> 01:17:19,876
哇。-如果你们要把我的钱给我，
Wow. -If y'all was gonna be giving out my money,

1195
01:17:19,876 --> 01:17:21,878
我希望你能提醒我一下，
I'd appreciate some type of a heads-up,

1196
01:17:21,878 --> 01:17:23,328
你知道我在说什么吗?
you know what I'm saying?

1197
01:17:23,328 --> 01:17:25,364
我们谈多少钱，兄弟?
How much we talking about, bruh?

1198
01:17:25,364 --> 01:17:26,918
只是一个合理的数量。
Just like a reasonable amount.

1199
01:17:27,470 --> 01:17:29,403
怎么样?
How about that?

1200
01:17:30,922 --> 01:17:32,440
这些钱都不够买松饼。
That won't even cover the muffins.

1201
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:33,683
这家伙是认真的吗?
Is this guy serious?

1202
01:17:33,683 --> 01:17:35,685
狗屎的疯狂。Mm-kay。
Shit's crazy. Mm-kay.

1203
01:17:35,685 --> 01:17:37,860
拜托，伙计，你是宇航员。
Come on, man, you're an astronaut.

1204
01:17:39,102 --> 01:17:41,208
嗯，这个怎么样?
Well, how about that?

1205
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:42,796
怎么，你把钱都留在太空了吗?
What, did you leave all your money in space?

1206
01:17:42,796 --> 01:17:44,694
伙计，把这个给我。
Man, give me this.

1207
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:46,351
-谢谢。-你是认真的吗?
- Thank you. - Are you serious right now?

1208
01:17:46,351 --> 01:17:48,733
你知道这里的一切都是我付的吧?
You know I pay for everything around here, right?

1209
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:50,562
你应该支付所有的费用。
You should pay for everything.

1210
01:17:50,562 --> 01:17:53,807
正是你在罗马的任务让我们来到这里。
It's your mission in Rome that got us here in the first place.

1211
01:17:53,807 --> 01:17:56,223
不，是你的情报把我们带到了罗马。
No, it was your intel that led us to Rome.

1212
01:17:56,223 --> 01:17:58,432
公平地说，这种设置会让我们中的大多数人感到困惑。
To be fair, that setup would have confused the best of us.

1213
01:17:58,432 --> 01:17:59,675
不，我受够了。
No, I'm tired of this.

1214
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,090
因为他只会说话。
'Cause all he do is talk.

1215
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:03,471
然后每个人都要做好自己和你的工作。
And then everyone has to do their job and yours.

1216
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:04,818
你在说什么，泰吉?
What are you saying, Tej?

1217
01:18:04,818 --> 01:18:06,371
-我在说什么?嘿,家伙。
- Mean, what I'm saying? Hey, guys.

1218
01:18:06,371 --> 01:18:08,580
-这是一个家庭环境。——什么?真的吗?
- This is a family environment. - What? Really?

1219
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,478
——真的吗?出去吧，伙计们。
- Really? Take it outside, fellas.

1220
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:13,171
我们在做什么，兄弟?
So, what we doing, bruh?

1221
01:18:13,171 --> 01:18:14,413
哦。
Uh-oh.

1222
01:18:14,413 --> 01:18:17,106
-先生们，拜托!伙计们!
- Gentlemen, please! Guys!

1223
01:18:18,348 --> 01:18:20,419
哦，不是自动售货机。不。女人:难以置信。
Oh, not the vending machine. No. -WOMAN: Unbelievable.

1224
01:18:20,419 --> 01:18:23,526
伙计们，你们造成了几十美元的损失!
Guys, you're causing like dozens of dollars in damage!

1225
01:18:23,526 --> 01:18:25,355
我们走吧。来吧。
Let's go. Come on.

1226
01:18:25,355 --> 01:18:27,392
我们应该停止这一切吗?
Should we stop this?

1227
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,845
坚持住!-不，让他们团结起来。
Hold on! - Nah, let 'em bond.

1228
01:18:32,673 --> 01:18:35,124
嘿!那台电脑是98年的!
Hey! That computer's from, like, '98!

1229
01:18:36,194 --> 01:18:37,885
嗯?
Huh?

1230
01:18:38,817 --> 01:18:41,820
鲍伊(呼应):怎么回事，伙计?
BOWIE [echoing]: What the hell, man?

1231
01:18:52,382 --> 01:18:54,453
好吧。好吧。
Okay. All right.

1232
01:18:54,453 --> 01:18:55,765
我们现在在做胃。
We doing stomachs now.

1233
01:18:55,765 --> 01:18:57,318
好了好了，够了。
All right, all right, that's enough.

1234
01:18:57,318 --> 01:18:58,975
你想要这个已经很多年了!呃，我想
You've been wanting that for years! -BOWIE: Uh, I think

1235
01:18:58,975 --> 01:19:01,150
他把复印机弄坏了，现在还能用。
he hit the copy machine so hard it works now.

1236
01:19:05,499 --> 01:19:06,914
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell was that?

1237
01:19:06,914 --> 01:19:08,053
他就像一个贫民窟的魔术师。
He's like a ghetto magician.

1238
01:19:08,053 --> 01:19:10,090
你知道这是什么，兄弟。
You know what it is, bruh.

1239
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:12,333
-我揍你-你刚揍我?
- I beat your ass. - You just beat my ass?

1240
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:13,610
-揍我一顿?-天啊，
- Beat my ass, huh? - My God,

1241
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:14,888
你们俩能不能别吵了?请。
will you two just quit it? Please.

1242
01:19:14,888 --> 01:19:16,855
我们没时间了。你。
We don't have time for this. You.

1243
01:19:16,855 --> 01:19:18,443
-开始工作。-我只是需要
- Get to work. - Oh, I just need

1244
01:19:18,443 --> 01:19:20,479
黑进市场。只需要一点时间。
to hack into the marketplace. It'll just take a second.

1245
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:22,688
哦。
Oops.

1246
01:19:22,688 --> 01:19:24,518
怎么回事，鲍伊?你刚刚做了什么?
What the hell, Bowie? What did you just do?

1247
01:19:24,518 --> 01:19:25,830
我很抱歉。你们的脸是，
I'm sorry. Your guys's faces are,

1248
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:27,590
在暗网上到处都是。
like, all over the dark web.

1249
01:19:27,590 --> 01:19:29,247
我是说，那奖励太棒了。
I mean, that reward is dope.

1250
01:19:29,247 --> 01:19:31,076
-噢。嘿。-我们得走了。
-  Ow. Hey. - We have to move.

1251
01:19:31,076 --> 01:19:33,665
-还有几分钟就到。-听着，这不是针对你
- The agency's minutes away. - Look, it's nothing personal.

1252
01:19:33,665 --> 01:19:35,909
-嘿，有趣的松饼请我，好吗?——什么?嗯?
- Hey, fun muffins on me, okay? - What? Huh?

1253
01:19:35,909 --> 01:19:36,979
——哦!哦!
- Oh! Oh!

1254
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:39,188
我活该。
I deserved that.

1255
01:19:39,188 --> 01:19:41,811
-你没事吧，兄弟?-是的，谢谢你，伙计。
- Are you okay, bro? - Yeah, thank you, man.

1256
01:19:47,127 --> 01:19:48,818
好吧，那你现在要去哪?
All right, so where to now, huh?

1257
01:19:48,818 --> 01:19:50,095
——监狱?
- Jail?

1258
01:19:50,095 --> 01:19:53,443
我知道某个地方。我最不想去的地方。
I know somewhere. Last place I want to go.

1259
01:20:18,986 --> 01:20:21,782
站在我这边是什么感觉?
How does it feel to be on my side of the law?

1260
01:20:21,782 --> 01:20:24,647
他们喜欢在弄坏东西之前先修好。
They like to fix things before they break 'em.

1261
01:20:24,647 --> 01:20:27,339
那是个恶心的地方，蕾蒂。
It's a sick place, Letty.

1262
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:32,172
不客气
You're welcome.

1263
01:20:32,172 --> 01:20:33,518
你做了什么?
What did you do?

1264
01:20:33,518 --> 01:20:36,624
我把麻醉气体引入了他们的空调。
I rerouted anesthetic gas into their air conditioning.

1265
01:20:36,624 --> 01:20:40,111
我在摄像头复位前给我们争取了几分钟
And I bought us a few minutes before these cameras reset

1266
01:20:40,111 --> 01:20:43,045
他们发现这个地方变成了睡眠研究中心。
and they find out this place turned into a sleep study.

1267
01:20:47,256 --> 01:20:50,431
你是想继续生气，还是想离开这里?
You gonna stay grumpy or do you want to get out of here?

1268
01:20:51,501 --> 01:20:53,952
他们不会永远睡下去的。
They're not gonna sleep forever.

1269
01:20:53,952 --> 01:20:56,852
你不想回到你亲爱的家人身边吗?
Don't you want to get back to your precious family?

1270
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:59,993
大便。
Shit.

1271
01:21:02,754 --> 01:21:04,721
看来你已经搞定了。
Seems like you got this covered.

1272
01:21:04,721 --> 01:21:06,516
-你需要我做什么?-我有个计划
- What do you need me for? - I have a plan,

1273
01:21:06,516 --> 01:21:09,105
但这是两个人的工作。
but it's a two-person job.

1274
01:21:17,942 --> 01:21:19,598
那么，这有那么难吗?
Now, was that so hard?

1275
01:21:20,496 --> 01:21:22,601
我们还有多少时间?
How much time do we have?

1276
01:21:22,601 --> 01:21:24,707
我想大概四分钟吧。
I'd say about four minutes.

1277
01:21:24,707 --> 01:21:25,881
只能这样了。
It'll have to do.

if you want to take a look.

1328
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:17,802
现在你真的需要一块新表了。
Now you really do need a new watch.

1329
01:25:23,048 --> 01:25:24,705
该死的。
Damn it.

1330
01:25:34,543 --> 01:25:35,682
B，你没事吧?
B, you okay?

1331
01:25:37,684 --> 01:25:39,168
试过口香糖吗?口香糖有帮助。
Tried gum? Gum helps.

1332
01:25:39,168 --> 01:25:41,515
我不喜欢飞机。
I don't like planes.

1333
01:25:41,515 --> 01:25:44,415
如果是身高的问题，那就有问题了。
If it's the height, that's gonna be an issue.

1334
01:25:45,381 --> 01:25:47,866
你知道吗，我以前很怕车。
You know, I used to be scared of cars.

1335
01:25:48,764 --> 01:25:52,630
我爸爸死后，我想我是在自责。
After my dad died, I guess I blamed myself.

1336
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:53,665
这很艰难。
It was tough.

1337
01:25:53,665 --> 01:25:56,185
我一直都有恐慌症。
I had panic attacks, the whole bit.

1338
01:25:56,185 --> 01:25:57,704
见鬼，我坐公共汽车。
Heck, I took the bus.

1339
01:25:57,704 --> 01:26:00,603
是的。我想我只是太担心犯错误了
Yeah. I think I was just so worried about making mistakes

1340
01:26:00,603 --> 01:26:03,813
而且不如我哥哥好。
and not being as good as my brother.

1341
01:26:03,813 --> 01:26:05,263
——你呢?-不好意思。
- You? - Uh, excuse me.

1342
01:26:05,263 --> 01:26:07,092
你见过你爸爸吗?
Have you met your dad?

1343
01:26:07,092 --> 01:26:09,094
他的影子相当大。
He casts a pretty big shadow.

1344
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:14,686
嗯。感觉好点了吗?
Huh. Feeling better?

1345
01:26:14,686 --> 01:26:15,825
-是的。——好。
- Yeah. - Good.

1346
01:26:15,825 --> 01:26:17,655
我也是。
Me, too.

1347
01:26:21,693 --> 01:26:25,387
先生，这是您点的饮料。
Here's the drink that you ordered, sir.

1348
01:26:27,872 --> 01:26:29,701
你认识她?
You know her?

1349
01:26:29,701 --> 01:26:32,842
是啊，有身居高位的朋友真好。
Yeah, it's good to have friends in high places.

1350
01:26:32,842 --> 01:26:34,568
我数到三，
On the count of three,

1351
01:26:34,568 --> 01:26:37,192
我们要起来去趟洗手间。准备好了吗?
we're gonna get up and go to the bathroom. Ready?

1352
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,504
——三个。
- Three.

1353
01:27:14,332 --> 01:27:15,747
那些人是谁?
Who were those guys?

1354
01:27:15,747 --> 01:27:18,474
机构。他们找到我们了。现在让我们丢掉尾巴。
Agency. They found us. Now let's lose our tail.

1355
01:27:26,827 --> 01:27:28,691
圣史……
Holy shi...

1356
01:27:28,691 --> 01:27:33,144
等等!只对歌词和脚趾说脏话。
Wait! Swearing is for song lyrics only and stubbed toes.

1357
01:27:33,144 --> 01:27:34,559
忘了它吧。注意。
Forget about it. Pay attention.

1358
01:27:34,559 --> 01:27:36,975
好吧?我们飞得太高了，不能滑翔，
Okay? We're-we're too high to glide,

1359
01:27:36,975 --> 01:27:40,185
所以我们需要推力，也就是说，
so we need thrust, which means, uh,

1360
01:27:40,185 --> 01:27:42,464
燃烧，这意味着…?
combustion, which means...?

1361
01:27:43,637 --> 01:27:47,262
氧气和燃料。
Oxygen and fuel.

1362
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,332
酒精。
Alcohol.

1363
01:27:48,332 --> 01:27:49,747
——嗯…——嗯?
- Um... - Huh?

1364
01:27:49,747 --> 01:27:50,989
哦。
Oh.

1365
01:27:58,238 --> 01:27:59,653
这是玫瑰。没用的。
That's rosé. Not gonna work.

1366
01:27:59,653 --> 01:28:01,483
很长的故事。但是很好的主动性。
Long story. But good initiative.

1367
01:28:12,252 --> 01:28:14,219
我很高兴不是因为它的高度。
I'm glad it wasn't the height.

1368
01:28:14,219 --> 01:28:15,876
享受旅程吧，小B。
Enjoy the ride, Little B.

1369
01:28:28,406 --> 01:28:30,097
鲍伊给我们做了标记。
Bowie tagged us.

1370
01:28:30,097 --> 01:28:31,375
中情局在跟踪我们。
The agency is on our tail.

1371
01:28:31,375 --> 01:28:32,755
我们得找到装备
We need to find gear

1372
01:28:32,755 --> 01:28:34,930
尽快赶到集合地点。
and get to the rendezvous as soon as possible.

1373
01:28:34,930 --> 01:28:36,207
就在这里。
It's right here.

1374
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:39,452
你们退后。让我来处理这个。
You guys hold back. Let me take care of this.

1375
01:28:39,452 --> 01:28:41,661
不，不，不。这不是个好主意。
No, no, no. Th-That's a bad idea.

1376
01:28:41,661 --> 01:28:44,353
-我是说罗马式的糟糕。——什么?
- I mean like Roman-level bad. - What?

1377
01:28:44,353 --> 01:28:45,423
你在说什么，伙计?
What are you talking about, man?

1378
01:28:45,423 --> 01:28:46,873
你听到我说的了。
You heard what I said.

1379
01:28:46,873 --> 01:28:49,047
听着，兄弟，你没必要这么做。
Look, bro, you don't have to do this, man.

1380
01:28:49,047 --> 01:28:50,704
你知道我挺你的。
You know I got your back.

1381
01:28:50,704 --> 01:28:51,809
我们支持你。
We got your back.

1382
01:28:55,019 --> 01:28:57,435
-我得一个人去。
- I got to do this alone.

1383
01:29:16,212 --> 01:29:18,560
我有事要跟你说。
I have something to talk to you about.

1384
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:22,115
死人出现在我门前的唯一原因是
The only reason a dead guy shows up at my door:

1385
01:29:22,115 --> 01:29:23,392
报复。
revenge.

1386
01:29:28,017 --> 01:29:29,122
哦,史…
Oh, shi...

1387
01:29:32,401 --> 01:29:34,817
-该死。——大便。汉!
- Oh, shit. - Shit. Han!

1388
01:29:36,129 --> 01:29:38,269
我应该死的。
Should have stayed dead.

1389
01:29:38,269 --> 01:29:40,098
我能进去。我能进去。
I can get in. I can get in.

1390
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:42,549
我不喜欢重复自己的话。
I don't like repeating myself.

1391
01:29:42,549 --> 01:29:44,965
你毁了我的零食。
You ruined my snacks.

1392
01:29:48,417 --> 01:29:51,696
放松。我不想和你打架。
Relax. I don't want to fight you.

1393
01:29:51,696 --> 01:29:53,802
那就快结束了。
Then this is gonna end quick.

1394
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:32,427
你带了更多的人来杀我?
You bring more men to kill me?

1395
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,394
他们也想杀了我。
They're trying to kill me, too.

1396
01:30:35,084 --> 01:30:37,535
看来我们又多了一个同伴。
Well, it looks like we got more company.

1397
01:30:37,535 --> 01:30:40,193
-你还开车?-你觉得呢?
- You still drive? - What do you think?

1398
01:30:43,403 --> 01:30:45,578
好吧，给我一点时间。
Okay, just give me a second.

1399
01:30:45,578 --> 01:30:46,889
冻结!
Freeze!

1400
01:31:10,154 --> 01:31:12,018
-放下笔记本电脑!——好的。
- Drop the laptop! - Okay.

1401
01:31:38,182 --> 01:31:39,563
-伙计们，我加入。
- Guys, I'm in.

1402
01:31:51,333 --> 01:31:52,748
不，不，不，不!
No, no, no, no!

1403
01:31:57,063 --> 01:31:58,478
现在我们扯平了。
Now we're even.

1404
01:32:05,278 --> 01:32:06,313
你没事吧?
You okay?

1405
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,608
现在，看，这一切我都明白了。
Now, see, I understand all this.

1406
01:32:24,608 --> 01:32:26,057
那是什么鬼东西?
What the hell was that?

1407
01:32:31,235 --> 01:32:32,995
你害怕了。我看到了。
You got scared. I saw that.

1408
01:32:32,995 --> 01:32:36,033
-没人害怕，兄弟。-不，你…他很害怕。
- Ain't nobody got scared, bruh. - No, you were... he was scared.

1409
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:52,774
莱蒂[对着发言者]:我们有一位不速之客。
LETTY [over speakers]: We have an unwanted guest.

1410
01:32:52,774 --> 01:32:53,947
DOM(通过扬声器):我的家人?
DOM [over speakers]: My family?

1411
01:32:53,947 --> 01:32:55,604
他们现在是安全的。
They're safe for now.

1412
01:32:55,604 --> 01:32:56,709
你什么都不怕。
You're not afraid of anything.

1413
01:32:56,709 --> 01:32:58,296
我不在乎死。
I don't care about dying.

1414
01:32:58,296 --> 01:33:01,403
我只关心保护我爱的人。
I only care about protecting the people that I love.

1415
01:33:01,403 --> 01:33:02,577
把我们放在你心里
Hold us in your heart

1416
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,164
你永远不会迷失方向。
and you will never lose your way.

1417
01:33:04,164 --> 01:33:05,580
你什么都不怕。
You're not afraid of anything.

1418
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,167
恐惧可以是一位伟大的老师。
Fear can be a great teacher.

1419
01:33:07,167 --> 01:33:08,721
小布莱恩(变形):你什么都不怕。
LITTLE BRIAN [distorted]: You're not afraid of anything.

1420
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:24,875
但丁(在电话中):你觉得我住的地方怎么样?
DANTE [over phone]: How do you like my place?

1421
01:33:24,875 --> 01:33:28,257
我很遗憾不能带你四处看看。
I'm bummed I'm not there to show you around.

1422
01:33:28,257 --> 01:33:30,639
你看到我的愿景板有点尴尬。
And a little embarrassed you saw my vision board.

1423
01:33:32,123 --> 01:33:34,091
但至少你知道我有多努力
But at least you know how hard I've been working

1424
01:33:34,091 --> 01:33:35,437
让我们走到这一步。
to get us to this point.

1425
01:33:35,437 --> 01:33:37,197
现在我知道你死定了。
Now I know you're a dead man.

1426
01:33:37,197 --> 01:33:38,509
你是说复活。
You mean resurrected.

1427
01:33:38,509 --> 01:33:40,166
多亏了你。
Thanks to you.

1428
01:33:40,166 --> 01:33:41,892
你知道吗，如果你不开车的话，
You know, if you never would have gotten behind that wheel,

1429
01:33:41,892 --> 01:33:44,757
我永远不会成为今天的我。
I'd never be the man that I am today.

1430
01:33:44,757 --> 01:33:46,793
你创造了如此美好的生活
You built such a beautiful life,

1431
01:33:46,793 --> 01:33:49,831
充满了爱和亲情。
filled with love and family.

1432
01:33:49,831 --> 01:33:51,591
我从来没有这样的机会。
I never got that chance.

1433
01:33:51,591 --> 01:33:55,560
附带伤害，混乱，死亡。
Collateral damage, chaos, death.

1434
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:57,045
这是你的遗产。
This is your legacy.

1435
01:33:57,045 --> 01:33:58,391
我是你的遗产。
I'm your legacy.

1436
01:33:58,391 --> 01:34:00,151
你知道我不明白什么吗?
You know what I can't figure out?

1437
01:34:00,151 --> 01:34:04,086
一个天生如此富有的人是怎么做到的
How someone born so rich

1438
01:34:04,086 --> 01:34:07,676
选择最穷的人生道路。
chooses the poorest path through life.

1439
01:34:07,676 --> 01:34:09,505
你没有荣誉可言。
You got no honor.

1440
01:34:09,505 --> 01:34:13,199
没有荣誉，你就没有家庭。
Without honor, you got no family.

1441
01:34:14,476 --> 01:34:16,236
没有家人……
And without family...

1442
01:34:18,411 --> 01:34:20,447
…你什么都没有。
...you've got nothing.

1443
01:34:20,447 --> 01:34:22,415
因为你，我一无所有。
I have nothing because of you.

1444
01:34:22,415 --> 01:34:24,866
我的未来。我的家人。
My future. My family.

1445
01:34:24,866 --> 01:34:27,558
你从我这里偷来的。
You stole that from me.

1446
01:34:27,558 --> 01:34:30,319
现在我要让你心碎
And now I'm gonna break yours,

1447
01:34:30,319 --> 01:34:32,908
一块一块地。
piece by piece.

1448
01:34:32,908 --> 01:34:35,393
别说话了，面对我。
Stop talking and face me.

1449
01:34:35,393 --> 01:34:36,843
你喜欢惊喜吗，多米?
Do you like surprises, Dommy?

1450
01:34:36,843 --> 01:34:39,674
我崇拜他们。
I adore them.

1451
01:34:41,365 --> 01:34:42,884
但游戏还没有结束。
But the game's not over yet.

1452
01:34:42,884 --> 01:34:45,196
还有很多人需要伤害。
There's still so many people to hurt.

1453
01:34:47,923 --> 01:34:49,856
我来找你。
I'm coming for you.

1454
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:52,203
戴着手铐可做不到。
Well, that's gonna be hard to do in handcuffs.

1455
01:34:52,203 --> 01:34:54,378
好的，再见，多米。
Okay, bye, Dommy.

1456
01:34:54,378 --> 01:34:56,276
不，你先挂电话。
No, you hang up first.

1457
01:34:56,276 --> 01:34:57,450
好吧。
Okay.

1458
01:35:07,771 --> 01:35:09,013
Toretto,冻结。
Toretto, freeze.

1459
01:35:09,013 --> 01:35:11,809
是时候面对现实了，多姆。
Time to face the music, Dom.

1460
01:35:11,809 --> 01:35:14,329
你这是正中他下怀，警察。
You're playing right into his hands, cop.

1461
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:53,195
好吧。来吧。
Okay. Come on.

1462
01:35:55,163 --> 01:35:56,854
哦。
Oh.

1463
01:35:59,788 --> 01:36:01,341
是的。
Yeah.

1464
01:36:11,627 --> 01:36:13,802
太好了。
Great.

1465
01:36:13,802 --> 01:36:16,115
就好了。
Just great.

1466
01:36:16,115 --> 01:36:17,944
大便。
Shit.

1467
01:36:24,537 --> 01:36:27,022
有点冷吗?
Little chilly?

1468
01:36:28,506 --> 01:36:29,818
你的计划还是很烂。
Your plan still sucks.

1469
01:36:29,818 --> 01:36:32,545
也许吧，但至少你会很暖和。
Maybe, but at least you'll be warm.

1470
01:36:33,615 --> 01:36:36,514
“谢谢你，塞弗。谢谢你。”
"Thank you, Cipher. Thank you."

1471
01:36:45,351 --> 01:36:46,455
-哇哦。
- Oh, wow.

1472
01:36:46,455 --> 01:36:47,836
看看这个。
Take a look at this.

1473
01:36:47,836 --> 01:36:49,665
这应该够我们齿轮部的了。
This should cover us in the gear department.

1474
01:36:49,665 --> 01:36:51,357
你不值得信任。
You are not to be trusted.

1475
01:36:51,357 --> 01:36:55,154
你也不在我的圣诞清单上。
Hey, you ain't on my Christmas list either.

1476
01:36:57,190 --> 01:36:59,744
这里没有免费的东西。让我把这一点说清楚。
Nothing here is for free. Let me be clear on that.

1477
01:36:59,744 --> 01:37:01,505
一定要他给你开收据，好吗?
Make sure you get a receipt from him, okay?

1478
01:37:01,505 --> 01:37:02,851
我很想看。
I'd love to see that.

1479
01:37:02,851 --> 01:37:04,508
我想是鲍伊吧
Well, I guess Bowie

1480
01:37:04,508 --> 01:37:06,648
也不是毫无价值。我可以用他的硬盘
wasn't entirely worthless. I can use his hard drive

1481
01:37:06,648 --> 01:37:08,063
来完成对但丁的追踪
to complete our trace of Dante.

1482
01:37:08,063 --> 01:37:10,583
他一直都比我们先走十步。
He's been ten moves ahead of us this whole time.

1483
01:37:10,583 --> 01:37:12,033
他一个人是怎么做到的?
How does he do it by himself?

1484
01:37:12,033 --> 01:37:13,724
这可不妙。
Uh, this isn't good.

1485
01:37:13,724 --> 01:37:16,071
我们的钱，分散在世界各地的账户里。
Our money, it's been split into accounts all over the world.

1486
01:37:16,071 --> 01:37:18,246
看看他们都登记在谁名下。
And look who they're registered to.

1487
01:37:18,246 --> 01:37:20,938
那些是雇佣兵杀人小队。真正的人渣。
Those are mercenary kill teams. Real scum.

1488
01:37:20,938 --> 01:37:22,767
他用我们的钱买了一支军队。
He used our money to buy an army.

1489
01:37:22,767 --> 01:37:24,769
所以这家伙不只是想让我们死。
So this guy doesn't just want us dead.

1490
01:37:24,769 --> 01:37:26,081
他想把我们从这个星球上抹去。
He wants to erase us off the planet.

1491
01:37:26,081 --> 01:37:27,565
他想拆散我们。
He's trying to tear us apart.

1492
01:37:27,565 --> 01:37:29,636
所以我们才需要和多姆重新连接
That's exactly why we need to link back up with Dom

1493
01:37:29,636 --> 01:37:31,846
在集合点。
at the rendezvous point.

1494
01:37:35,056 --> 01:37:36,643
你得看看这个。
You need to see this.

1495
01:37:38,714 --> 01:37:40,371
他们是被收买来攻击我们的
They've been paid to target us

1496
01:37:40,371 --> 01:37:43,892
还有之前帮助过我们的人。
and anyone who ever helped us until now.

1497
01:37:46,653 --> 01:37:48,207
妈妈。
Mum.

1498
01:38:10,781 --> 01:38:12,956
我会派交通工具等你。
I'll have transport waiting for you.

1499
01:38:12,956 --> 01:38:15,199
你要去哪里?
And where are you going?

1500
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,994
我要挖几个坟墓。
I'm gonna dig some graves.

1501
01:38:27,763 --> 01:38:29,386
<我>。没有人是金童，</i>
<i>Mr. Nobody's golden boy,</i>

1502
01:38:29,386 --> 01:38:31,560
<i>没怎么反抗就被抓住了</i>
<i>caught without so much as a fight.</i>

1503
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:33,217
这一点都不好玩。
That's no fun.

1504
01:38:33,217 --> 01:38:35,081
就像一直爬到珠穆朗玛峰一样
It's like going all the way to Everest

1505
01:38:35,081 --> 01:38:36,876
然后乘电梯。
and taking the elevator.

1506
01:38:38,567 --> 01:38:39,983
你最好系好安全带。
You might want to buckle up.

1507
01:38:39,983 --> 01:38:43,158
我知道你为局里做了不少好事。
I know you did some good work for the agency.

1508
01:38:43,158 --> 01:38:46,023
你肯定觉得这样能让你得到宽大处理。
I'm sure you figured that buys you some leniency.

1509
01:38:46,023 --> 01:38:48,094
但这是新的一天。
But it's a new day.

1510
01:38:48,094 --> 01:38:51,442
这就是现在的问题。没人听。
That's the problem nowadays. Nobody listens.

1511
01:38:54,825 --> 01:38:57,483
你应该少花点时间思考的
You should have spent less time with your head under the hood

1512
01:38:57,483 --> 01:38:59,899
还有更多的时间为即将到来的事情做准备。
and more time preparing for what's coming.

1513
01:38:59,899 --> 01:39:02,419
间谍已经被卫星取代，
Spies have been replaced by satellites,

1514
01:39:02,419 --> 01:39:07,355
战斗机飞行员靠无人机，情报靠算法。
fighter pilots by drones, intelligence by an algorithm.

1515
01:39:07,355 --> 01:39:10,116
一个人开车的时代
The days where one man behind the wheel of a car

1516
01:39:10,116 --> 01:39:12,981
都结束了，多姆。
can make a difference are over, Dom.

1517
01:39:12,981 --> 01:39:15,777
地狱，任何人的日子
Hell, the days of any man

1518
01:39:15,777 --> 01:39:17,744
后面的车轮的汽车都结束了。
behind the wheel of a car are over.

1519
01:39:20,989 --> 01:39:22,059
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

1520
01:39:22,059 --> 01:39:24,682
为即将到来的事情做准备。
Preparing for what's to come.

1521
01:39:24,682 --> 01:39:26,615
正确的。
Right.

1522
01:39:44,461 --> 01:39:45,600
走了。走了。走了。
Go. Go. Go.

1523
01:40:02,582 --> 01:40:06,862
多米尼克，我带你回到我们第一次见面的地方。
Dominic, I brought you back to where we first met.

1524
01:40:06,862 --> 01:40:08,588
我给你准备了一个惊喜。
And I have a surprise for you.

1525
01:40:35,029 --> 01:40:36,271
Dom !
Dom!

1526
01:40:37,479 --> 01:40:39,481
我正在听呢。
I'm listening now.

1527
01:41:13,619 --> 01:41:14,827
多米尼克?
Dominic?

1528
01:41:14,827 --> 01:41:16,139
多米尼克!
Dominic!

1529
01:41:16,139 --> 01:41:18,002
你能不能别再伤害我的新朋友了?
Would you stop hurting my new friends?

1530
01:41:18,002 --> 01:41:20,626
不。我只是来伤害你的。
No. I'm only here to hurt you.

1531
01:41:20,626 --> 01:41:21,661
哦。
Oh.

1532
01:41:21,661 --> 01:41:24,216
我不想骗你。
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1533
01:41:24,216 --> 01:41:25,872
你刚才在车里表演的特技?
That little car stunt you just did?

1534
01:41:25,872 --> 01:41:26,942
那真是太棒了。
That was pretty awesome.

1535
01:41:26,942 --> 01:41:28,185
不是吗?
Wasn't it?

1536
01:41:28,185 --> 01:41:29,531
太酷了。
It was so cool.

1537
01:41:29,531 --> 01:41:31,740
但如果你不停下来
But if you don't stop,

1538
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:34,847
我要把她全身都割开。
I'm gonna cut her everywhere.

1539
01:41:34,847 --> 01:41:36,331
得很厉害。
Badly.

1540
01:41:41,716 --> 01:41:43,338
她来了。
There she is.

1541
01:41:43,338 --> 01:41:45,823
——嗯。-时髦的迟到。
- Hmm. - Fashionably late.

1542
01:41:46,755 --> 01:41:48,171
你说对了。
You got me.

1543
01:41:49,068 --> 01:41:51,035
嗯。
Mmm.

1544
01:41:51,035 --> 01:41:53,452
-你走吧。
- Off you go.

1545
01:41:54,901 --> 01:41:56,800
家庭。
Family.

1546
01:41:59,147 --> 01:42:02,116
请你从我的车上下来好吗?
Will you please get off my car?

1547
01:42:04,083 --> 01:42:05,774
——嗯。
- Hmm.

1548
01:42:05,774 --> 01:42:07,604
这太不尊重了。
That is so disrespectful.

1549
01:42:07,604 --> 01:42:09,399
你话太多了。
You talk too much.

1550
01:42:23,206 --> 01:42:24,379
停,停!
Stop, stop!

1551
01:42:24,379 --> 01:42:25,863
你不知道自己的力量。
You don't know your own strength.

1552
01:42:29,798 --> 01:42:31,317
你屁眼!
You butthole!

1553
01:42:31,317 --> 01:42:33,492
哦,嘿。
Oh, hey.

1554
01:42:34,700 --> 01:42:36,702
你喜欢芭蕾吗?
Do you like ballet?

1555
01:42:36,702 --> 01:42:38,324
我喜欢《天鹅湖》。</ I >
I adore <i>Swan Lake.</i>

1556
01:42:38,324 --> 01:42:40,223
我觉得你更像是《胡桃夹子》里的那种人。
I feel like you're more of a-- kind of a <i>Nutcracker</i> guy.

1557
01:42:40,223 --> 01:42:43,329
一个1，一个2，还有……
And a one, and a two, and...

1558
01:42:45,124 --> 01:42:46,746
不!
No!

1559
01:42:52,959 --> 01:42:54,478
等一下。
Wait for it.

1560
01:42:57,101 --> 01:42:58,655
哦,不。
Oh, no.

1561
01:42:58,655 --> 01:43:01,451
她有危险。你会怎么做?
She's in peril. What will you do?

1562
01:43:03,418 --> 01:43:05,317
你知道你的问题是什么吗?
You know what your problem is?

1563
01:43:06,904 --> 01:43:09,597
家庭。
Family.

1564
01:43:10,736 --> 01:43:12,358
你不可能把他们都救出来。
You can't save 'em all.

1565
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:16,569
五个四。
Five. Four.

1566
01:43:16,569 --> 01:43:17,915
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta。
Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta.

1567
01:43:17,915 --> 01:43:19,434
继续。
Go on.

1568
01:43:19,434 --> 01:43:20,780
两个。
Two.

1569
01:43:32,758 --> 01:43:34,553
你不喜欢芭蕾。
You don't like ballet.

1570
01:43:34,553 --> 01:43:36,244
我能感觉到。
I can feel it.

1571
01:43:36,244 --> 01:43:38,212
能把上帝之眼给我吗?
May I please have the God's Eye?

1572
01:43:38,212 --> 01:43:39,834
-去你的。——不是吗?
- Screw you. - No?

1573
01:43:39,834 --> 01:43:40,938
很好吗?
Pretty please?

1574
01:43:42,319 --> 01:43:43,734
-哦，在这儿。
- Oh, there it is.

1575
01:43:43,734 --> 01:43:45,943
哦。明白了。
Ooh. Gotcha.

1576
01:43:46,910 --> 01:43:49,153
良好的贸易。留着车吧。
Good trade. Keep the car.

1577
01:43:49,153 --> 01:43:50,914
哦,Dommy !
Oh, Dommy!

1578
01:43:52,226 --> 01:43:56,264
我告诉过你，你欠我痛苦!
I told you, you owe me suffering!

1579
01:43:56,264 --> 01:43:58,784
你的遗产不是金钱或权力
Your legacy isn't money or power

1580
01:43:58,784 --> 01:44:01,269
或是你建立的家庭或是你过的生活。
or the family you built or the life you led.

1581
01:44:01,269 --> 01:44:04,410
这是你创造的生活。
It's the life you made.

1582
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:07,896
还有一对父子…
And a father and his son...

1583
01:44:07,896 --> 01:44:09,208
就是一切。
is everything.

1584
01:44:09,208 --> 01:44:11,314
你在这座桥上杀了我父亲。
You killed my father on this bridge.

1585
01:44:11,314 --> 01:44:15,041
现在我知道去哪儿找你儿子了。
And now I know where to find your son.

1586
01:44:16,905 --> 01:44:19,253
<我> < / i >很高兴认识你。
<i>Enchanté.</i>

1587
01:44:28,434 --> 01:44:31,817
你会没事的，苔丝。它完全通过了。
You're gonna be okay, Tess. It went clear through.

1588
01:44:31,817 --> 01:44:33,232
有点疼。
Kinda hurts.

1589
01:44:33,232 --> 01:44:35,303
你父亲会为你骄傲的。
Your father would be proud.

1590
01:44:35,303 --> 01:44:37,305
是的。
Yeah.

1591
01:44:37,305 --> 01:44:39,756
你会阻止他的。
You will stop him.

1592
01:44:41,136 --> 01:44:42,621
要有信心。
Have faith.

1593
01:44:54,184 --> 01:44:55,703
她需要去医院
She needs a hospital.

1594
01:44:55,703 --> 01:44:57,601
毫米。
Mm.

1595
01:45:16,965 --> 01:45:18,967
你会没事的。
You're gonna be okay.

1596
01:45:18,967 --> 01:45:20,452
我抓住她了。
I got her.

1597
01:45:20,452 --> 01:45:22,074
去救你儿子吧。
Go save your son.

1598
01:45:23,317 --> 01:45:25,388
我的侄子。
My nephew.

1599
01:45:38,573 --> 01:45:42,370
我不会道歉的，让我帮你个忙。
I'm not gonna say I'm sorry, so let me do you one better.

1600
01:45:42,370 --> 01:45:44,717
我们去救你儿子吧。
Let's get your son.

你了解你爸爸。

他得保证安全。
He's got to make it safe.

我们就等着吧。
We'll just wait.

那是什么?
What's that?

1623
01:47:01,967 --> 01:47:05,349
了吗?啊，我一直在做的项目。
That? Ah, project I've been working on.

1624
01:47:05,349 --> 01:47:07,628
你不会感兴趣的。
You wouldn't be interested.

雅各布已经在那里了。多姆有消息吗?
Jakob's already there. Any word from Dom?

1627
01:47:26,888 --> 01:47:28,752
嘿。
Hey.

1628
01:47:28,752 --> 01:47:30,996
你怎么这么安静?你没事吧?
Why are you so quiet? You all right?

1629
01:47:30,996 --> 01:47:33,481
我就坐在这里想，伙计。
Just been sitting here thinking, man.

1630
01:47:33,481 --> 01:47:34,896
我就知道我闻到了烧焦的味道。
I knew I smelled something burning in here.

1631
01:47:34,896 --> 01:47:39,176
泰吉，这是我的任务，你们都听我的，
Tej, it was my mission, y'all took my lead,

1632
01:47:39,176 --> 01:47:41,972
而我却把事情搞砸了
and I messed this thing up every step of the way.

1633
01:47:41,972 --> 01:47:44,665
我想这整个…
I guess this whole...

1634
01:47:44,665 --> 01:47:46,805
我真的不适合做领导。
leadership thing really ain't for me.

1635
01:47:46,805 --> 01:47:49,842
你用集装箱把我们带到伦敦。
You took us to London on a container.

1636
01:47:49,842 --> 01:47:53,018
你花了几千美元自己的钱，
You spent thousands of dollars of your own cash,

1637
01:47:53,018 --> 01:47:54,882
绑在你屁股上
strapped to your ass,

1638
01:47:54,882 --> 01:47:57,540
现在闻起来像廉价古龙水。
that now smells like cheap cologne.

1639
01:47:57,540 --> 01:47:59,542
现在你坐在这里独自承担责任
Now you're sitting here taking sole responsibility

1640
01:47:59,542 --> 01:48:01,682
我们都穿的东西。
for something that we all wear.

1641
01:48:01,682 --> 01:48:03,477
是的，我知道。这听起来很愚蠢。
Yeah, I know. It sounds stupid.

1642
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:04,754
不，听起来一点也不傻。
Nah, it don't sound stupid at all.

1643
01:48:04,754 --> 01:48:06,272
你知道这听起来像什么吗?
You know what it sounds like to me?

1644
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,758
听起来像个领袖。
That sounds like a leader.

1645
01:48:17,698 --> 01:48:19,976
拜托，伙计。快起来，伙计。
Come on, man. Get your ass up, man.

1646
01:48:21,287 --> 01:48:23,358
我爱你，伙计。
I love you, man.

1647
01:48:23,358 --> 01:48:24,636
我也爱你，兄弟。
I love you, too, bro.

1648
01:48:24,636 --> 01:48:27,708
有时候我们得说声"对不起"
Sometimes we got to say, "I'm sorry."

1649
01:48:27,708 --> 01:48:29,503
我很抱歉打了你一顿，
I'm sorry for whupping your ass, man,

1650
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:31,366
因为我不是故意的。
'cause I didn't really mean to do that.

1651
01:48:31,366 --> 01:48:33,334
整件事，就完全不一样了…-
The whole thing, it would've been a whole dif... -

1652
01:48:33,334 --> 01:48:35,474
-你没事吧?怎么了?
- You okay? What's wrong?

1653
01:48:35,474 --> 01:48:37,683
我只是对你的废话过敏。
I'm just allergic to your bullshit.

1654
01:48:37,683 --> 01:48:39,271
-别这样。
- Come on.

1655
01:48:42,688 --> 01:48:45,311
嘿，放轻松点。你会把它弄坏的。
Hey, go easy there. You're gonna break that thing.

1656
01:48:45,311 --> 01:48:47,175
-你没事吧?
- You all right?

1657
01:48:47,175 --> 01:48:48,798
上帝之眼只是用来发送
God's Eye was just used to send

1658
01:48:48,798 --> 01:48:50,903
数十名雇佣兵追杀多姆的儿子
dozens of mercenaries after Dom's son.

1659
01:48:50,903 --> 01:48:55,632
我创造的东西伤害了我们爱的人。
Something I created hurting the people we love.

1660
01:48:58,393 --> 01:49:00,326
这是为了帮助。
It was meant to help.

1661
01:49:00,326 --> 01:49:02,639
这不仅仅是但丁的事。
This is bigger than just Dante.

1662
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:04,641
这不仅仅是我们的事。
This is bigger than just us.

1663
01:49:04,641 --> 01:49:07,575
我们必须马上阻止这个怪物。
We have to stop this monster now.

1664
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:22,901
我们得走了。
We got to go.

1665
01:49:44,198 --> 01:49:45,509
坚持住!
Hold on!

1666
01:49:55,071 --> 01:49:57,107
我看到肌肉叔叔和那孩子了。
I got eyes on Uncle Muscle and the kid.

1667
01:49:57,107 --> 01:49:59,282
好了，大家记住计划。
All right, everybody, remember the plan.

1668
01:49:59,282 --> 01:50:01,560
控制和绑架。谢谢你！
Contain and kidnap. Thank you.

1669
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:03,320
不。
No.

1670
01:50:03,320 --> 01:50:04,528
没有枪支。
No guns.

1671
01:50:04,528 --> 01:50:06,703
我要这个小混蛋活着。
I need this little shit alive.

1672
01:50:06,703 --> 01:50:08,291
至少暂时是这样。
At least for a while.

1673
01:50:37,838 --> 01:50:40,081
-准备好了吗?——准备好了。
- You ready? - Ready.

1674
01:50:57,098 --> 01:50:58,721
神圣的承宪……
Holy sh...

1675
01:50:59,445 --> 01:51:00,964
哦，不，你很好。你很好。
Oh, no, you're good. You're good.

1676
01:51:00,964 --> 01:51:03,553
好吧，歌词，脚趾和加农炮车。
Okay, uh, song lyrics, stubbed toes and cannon cars.

1677
01:51:03,553 --> 01:51:04,830
是的。
Yeah.

1678
01:51:09,283 --> 01:51:11,009
我们开始吧!
Here we go!

1679
01:52:02,543 --> 01:52:04,165
卡住了。卡住了。
It's stuck. It's stuck.

1680
01:52:07,651 --> 01:52:08,860
那里有一支军队，多姆。
They got an army down there, Dom.

1681
01:52:08,860 --> 01:52:10,862
你的队伍就在不远处。
Your team's not far out.

1682
01:52:10,862 --> 01:52:12,829
-带我们下来。-我不能把她放在这里。
- Bring us down. - I can't put her down here.

1683
01:52:12,829 --> 01:52:14,728
往西七公里处有个机场。
There's an airfield seven klicks west.

1684
01:52:14,728 --> 01:52:16,868
好的，我们在那里见。现在打开后面。
Okay, we'll meet you there. Now open the back.

1685
01:52:16,868 --> 01:52:19,836
多姆，真的没有地方可以降落。
Dom, there's really nowhere to land.

1686
01:52:21,562 --> 01:52:23,909
谁说要降落了?
Who said anything about landing?

1687
01:52:41,375 --> 01:52:43,135
看。
Look.

1688
01:52:49,003 --> 01:52:51,005
我来找你了，孩子。
I'm coming for you, son.

1689
01:53:00,256 --> 01:53:01,567
什么……
What the...

1690
01:53:31,839 --> 01:53:33,841
——爸爸!-嘿，儿子。
- Dad! - Hey, son.

1691
01:53:33,841 --> 01:53:35,809
很高兴见到你，大哥。
Good to see you, big bro.

1692
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:38,535
很高兴见到你们。跟我去那架飞机。
Good to see you guys. Follow me to that plane.

1693
01:53:38,535 --> 01:53:40,296
我们就在你后面。
We're right behind you.

1694
01:53:42,816 --> 01:53:44,403
我抓到你了。
I got you now.

1695
01:53:52,515 --> 01:53:54,206
艾姆斯，我们在路上了。
Aimes, we're on our way.

1696
01:53:54,206 --> 01:53:57,175
多姆，我会在西边五公里处着陆。
Dom, I'll be touching down five klicks west.

1697
01:53:57,175 --> 01:53:58,832
但他们还在跟踪你。
But they're still on your tail.

1698
01:54:00,626 --> 01:54:02,249
它是卡住了。
It's jammed.

1699
01:54:06,046 --> 01:54:08,738
B，你在干什么?
B, what are you doing?

1700
01:54:10,740 --> 01:54:12,224
小心。
Careful.

1701
01:54:13,777 --> 01:54:15,193
好，好，好。
Okay, okay, okay.

1702
01:54:23,684 --> 01:54:26,583
关上前门。
Shut the front door.

1703
01:54:26,583 --> 01:54:28,102
小B。
Little B.

1704
01:54:34,937 --> 01:54:37,422
雅各布叔叔!
Uncle Jakob!

1705
01:54:37,422 --> 01:54:39,389
我修好了!
I fixed it!

1706
01:54:44,463 --> 01:54:45,809
B !
B!

1707
01:54:45,809 --> 01:54:47,363
Toodle-oo。
Toodle-oo.

1708
01:54:49,123 --> 01:54:50,642
——帮助!——Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta。闭嘴。
- Help! - Ah-ta-ta-ta-ta. Shut up.

1709
01:54:50,642 --> 01:54:51,919
该死的。
Damn it.

1710
01:54:51,919 --> 01:54:53,990
你的聚会吗?我的派对。
You party? I party.

1711
01:54:53,990 --> 01:54:55,923
——哇。
-  Whoa.

1712
01:54:56,959 --> 01:54:59,547
多姆，我跟丢了他。但丁有小B。
Dom, I lost him. Dante has Little B.

1713
01:55:19,084 --> 01:55:21,431
嘿,多米尼克。欢迎来到大对决。
Hey, Dominic. Welcome to the big showdown.

1714
01:55:21,431 --> 01:55:23,882
这是最后一圈。看看我的副驾驶。
It's the last lap. Check out my copilot.

1715
01:55:23,882 --> 01:55:26,712
——爸爸!-谁能料到会这样?
- Dad! - Who could've seen this coming?

1716
01:55:26,712 --> 01:55:28,611
我是说，除了我。
I mean, you know, except for me.

1717
01:55:45,835 --> 01:55:48,424
大便。看来我的油管被击中了。
Shit. Looks like my fuel line's been shot.

1718
01:55:49,563 --> 01:55:52,911
-我没法接近他，多姆-雅各布，坚持住。
- I can't get to him, Dom. - Jakob, stay with me.

1719
01:55:52,911 --> 01:55:55,500
我出局了。
I'm out of this race.

1720
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:56,950
必须是你。
It has to be you.

1721
01:55:56,950 --> 01:56:00,160
嘿,Dom !给你个小惊喜。
Hey, Dom! Got a little surprise for you.

1722
01:56:10,032 --> 01:56:12,517
你养了个好儿子，多姆。
You raised a hell of a son, Dom.

1723
01:56:12,517 --> 01:56:15,623
是时候让我走出你的阴影了。
Time for me to step out from under your shadow.

1724
01:56:16,659 --> 01:56:18,454
谢谢你给我指引光明。
Thanks for showing me the light.

1725
01:56:18,454 --> 01:56:19,800
雅克布?
Jakob?

1726
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,250
<i>我要去清理一下。</i>
<i>I'm gonna go clear the way.</i>

1727
01:56:22,630 --> 01:56:24,667
去找你儿子。
Go get your son.

1728
01:56:24,667 --> 01:56:26,013
雅克布,不要!
Jakob, don't!

1729
01:56:26,013 --> 01:56:28,084
——不!
- Don't!

1730
01:56:36,886 --> 01:56:38,370
雅各布叔叔!
Uncle Jakob!

1731
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:05,880
看来肌肉叔叔下次烧烤不会来了。
Looks like Uncle Muscle won't be coming to the next barbecue.

1732
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:07,986
哦。
Oh.

1733
01:57:07,986 --> 01:57:09,608
我是说，这很光荣。
I mean, it's very honorable.

1734
01:57:11,127 --> 01:57:13,336
三英里外。走服务路。
Three miles away. Take the service road.

1735
01:57:13,336 --> 01:57:15,062
它会直接带你到机场。
It'll lead you right to the airfield.

1736
01:57:26,487 --> 01:57:29,249
你知道怎么在街头赛车上打败你爸爸吗?
You know how to beat your dad in a street race?

1737
01:57:36,704 --> 01:57:38,016
把街道拿走。
Take away the streets.

1738
01:57:38,016 --> 01:57:39,742
——爸爸!
- Dad!

1739
01:57:45,644 --> 01:57:47,508
很神奇的。
Amazing.

1740
01:57:47,508 --> 01:57:48,613
哦。
Oh.

1741
01:58:02,005 --> 01:58:04,491
我们知道了。我们知道了。
We got it. We got it.

1742
01:58:12,464 --> 01:58:13,465
轮到我了。
My turn.

1743
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:40,389
他很好。你爸爸很好。
He's good. Your dad's good.

1744
01:58:45,463 --> 01:58:47,154
多姆，你还有一英里。
Dom, you got one mile left.

1745
01:58:47,154 --> 01:58:50,192
儿子，我从不食言。
Son, I never break a promise.

1746
01:58:50,192 --> 01:58:53,678
现在，让我们完成驾驶课。
Now, let's finish that driving lesson.

1747
01:58:53,678 --> 01:58:55,162
感受一下车，
Feel the car,

1748
01:58:55,162 --> 01:58:57,026
找到你的路线
find your line

1749
01:58:57,026 --> 01:58:58,441
和飞。
and fly.

1750
01:59:19,669 --> 01:59:20,705
——哦!
- Oh!

1751
01:59:34,995 --> 01:59:37,204
——现在!
- Now!

1752
01:59:50,838 --> 01:59:51,908
不。
No.

1753
01:59:54,014 --> 01:59:55,222
现在走辅路。
Take the service road now.

1754
02:00:03,472 --> 02:00:05,405
-我倒了。-我们现在去找你。
- I'm wheels down. - We're headed to you now.

1755
02:00:05,405 --> 02:00:07,407
你的队伍已经在路上了。
Your team is on their way.

1756
02:00:07,407 --> 02:00:09,132
我将在机场接你。
I'll meet you at the airfield.

1757
02:00:09,132 --> 02:00:11,238
-你没事吧?-我很好，爸爸。
- You okay? - I'm good, Dad.

1758
02:00:11,238 --> 02:00:13,551
我真为你骄傲，儿子。
I'm real proud of you, son.

1759
02:00:58,906 --> 02:01:01,254
哦，多米小子。
Oh, Dommy boy.

1760
02:01:01,254 --> 02:01:03,152
很高兴再次见到你。
It's so good to see you again.

1761
02:01:03,152 --> 02:01:05,672
你刚才是不是用直升机撞了我?
Did you hit me with a helicopter back there?

1762
02:01:05,672 --> 02:01:07,156
嗯。
Hmm.

1763
02:01:07,156 --> 02:01:09,814
哦，你这个大畜生。我是说，我明白。
Ow, you big brute. I mean, I get it.

1764
02:01:09,814 --> 02:01:12,230
你在你儿子面前炫耀。
You're showing off in front of your son.

1765
02:01:12,230 --> 02:01:13,611
但说实话，你真的认为
But honestly, did you really think

1766
02:01:13,611 --> 02:01:16,614
就这么简单吗?
it was going to be that easy?

1767
02:01:16,614 --> 02:01:19,030
你就在我希望你在的地方。
You're exactly where I wanted you to be.

1768
02:01:19,030 --> 02:01:20,963
是的。
Yes.

1769
02:01:20,963 --> 02:01:22,792
等一下。
Wait for it.

1770
02:01:22,792 --> 02:01:25,036
我给你准备了一个惊喜。
I got a surprise for you.

1771
02:01:31,732 --> 02:01:34,425
骑兵来了。我们抓住你了，多姆。
The cavalry's here. We got you, Dom.

1772
02:01:35,667 --> 02:01:37,807
罗曼，离开这里。这是个陷阱。
Roman, get out of here. It's a trap.

1773
02:01:41,708 --> 02:01:43,088
传入的!
Incoming!

1774
02:01:58,241 --> 02:01:59,726
是的!
