1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,808
Any spoken request
to leave the Silo is granted,

2
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,811
but it is irrevocable.

3
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,107
You have been asked to clean

4
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,693
and have been provided
with materials to do so,

5
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,572
but you cannot be forced into cleaning.

6
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,325
Once outside the air lock,

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,786
you are outside the law.

8
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,666
Have you any last words?

9
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,711
Sorry for all the fuss.

10
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,625
<i>We do not know why we are here.</i>

11
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,630
<i>We do not know who built the Silo.</i>

12
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,012
<i>We do not know why everything
outside the Silo is as it is.</i>

13
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:43,353
<i>We do not know when
it will be safe to go outside.</i>

14
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,027
<i>We only know that day...</i>

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,531
<i>is not this day.</i>

16
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,149
Why'd he say it?

17
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,907
I can't believe they're sending
the sheriff out to clean.

18
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:44,785
You know, once he said it,
they didn't have any choice.

19
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,870
But why would the sheriff wanna go out?

20
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,167
It's happening.

21
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:55,212
Oh, shit. He's coming.

22
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,273
Oh, no.

23
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,696
Come on.

24
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,909
Damn it, Allison.

25
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,788
You were right.

26
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,056
They have to see.

27
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,433
- How much?
- Ten.

28
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:36,063
You bet ten credits he wouldn't clean?
They always clean.

29
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,566
Can he last three minutes before
the poison gets him? That's the bet.

30
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,967
Come on, Sheriff!

31
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,239
What's he doing?

32
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,910
Has anyone taken their helmet off before?

33
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,878
Get up!

34
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,006
Where's he going?

35
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,884
To be with his wife.

36
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,371
The sheriff's dead. What happens now?

37
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:21,418
Fucking liar. He's a fucking liar!

38
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:30,302
Hey! Cut it out!

39
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,722
Stop now! Come on.

40
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,433
Listen up! Everybody, calm down!
Listen up!

41
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,608
That is fucked up, no question.

42
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,362
But it is no excuse for us
to lose our shit.

43
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,406
<i>If anybody's gonna fight over a sheriff
being sent out to clean,</i>

44
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,700
<i>let them fight Up Top or in the Mids.</i>

45
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:58,747
Here, in the Down Deep,
it's none of our business.

46
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,959
Our business is keeping the lights on.

47
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:03,544
<i>Yes!</i>

48
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,754
<i>Keeping the generator running.</i>

49
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,506
<i>Yes!</i>

50
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,967
<i>Keeping the Silo alive!</i>

51
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,010
<i>Yeah!</i>

52
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,888
<i>Here in the Down Deep,</i>

53
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:19,226
we'll just get shit done. Okay?

54
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,477
Yeah!

55
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:21,895
Okay?

56
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,984
- Okay?
- Yeah!

57
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,770
You got a message from Karins.

58
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,357
We've been getting more alerts
about people lining up at Recycling,

59
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,776
trying to get their hands on pipes,
hammers--

60
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,486
Yeah. People are boneheads.

61
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:12,696
Well, people are scared.

62
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:16,617
Yeah, I'm gonna check in with everybody
on the radio.

63
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,577
Do you want anything from the cafeteria?

64
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,120
You should go home, Sandy.

65
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,209
He really loved her.

66
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,753
If you're wondering why.

67
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,256
Yeah.

68
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,080
I'm a size medium, by the way.

69
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,041
Maybe 20 years ago.

70
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,838
The Jensen baby's due next week.

71
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:57,593
I used to be able to knock out 25
of these a year, one for every tenth kid.

72
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:59,553
Now I'm lucky if I do five.

73
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:03,348
- Drink?
- Yeah.

74
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,644
Day like today,
I think we get the good stuff.

75
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:14,359
Comes from before the rebellion.

76
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,862
Maybe before everything.

77
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,533
Thank you.

78
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,826
To Holston Becker.

79
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,169
You decide who you're gonna pick
for sheriff?

80
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:34,755
I'm not looking at him?

81
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,634
I'll help break in the next one,
but I'm going to retire.

82
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,513
When Jamal was retiring,

83
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:45,641
he chose Holston to be sheriff.
That was easy.

84
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,559
If Holston had been retiring,

85
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,645
I could've just followed his wishes,
but now...

86
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:53,106
Judicial will try and slip
one of their people into the post.

87
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,068
Holston didn't say anything to you?

88
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:05,410
I've been looking through
the mayor's ledgers. I'm up to 97.

89
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:12,459
Births. Deaths. How much water was used
that year. How many computer cables.

90
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,127
Was anyone sent out?

91
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,758
So far, not a single instance
of a mayor sending a sheriff out to clean.

92
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,969
He went out, but you didn't send him.

93
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:25,013
I didn't bring this up 'cause I feel sorry
for myself.

94
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,894
I brought it up 'cause I don't know what
happened before these ledgers existed.

95
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,064
Before the rebellion?

96
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,525
Before whatever caused the rebellion.

97
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:40,404
You worry it was a cleaning?

98
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,449
- I worry about instability.
- Yeah.

99
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:48,078
That's why we need
a new sheriff as soon as possible.

100
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,917
This is the last one we've got.

101
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,294
Thank you.

102
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,754
I need this.

103
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,592
- No, you're not getting it. No! You--
- No. I need this.

104
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:04,136
- No, you can't have my fucking hammer!
- Hey!

105
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:05,762
- Stop this shit!
- I need to protect my family!

106
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,349
- Put the hammer down.
- Hey! Cut that shit out!

107
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,352
Shit. Judicial.

108
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,229
Shit.

109
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,735
Deputy Brooks.

110
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,821
Mr. Sims, I got this under control.

111
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:26,867
Get their names.

112
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,165
<i>Any idea when we'll get a new sheriff?</i>

113
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,293
<i>'Cause there's still a long line
at our local Recycling,</i>

114
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,129
<i>and the deputy asked me to make sure
we have enough ammunition.</i>

115
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,889
<i>Level 14 is clear.</i>

116
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,364
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

117
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:07,616
It looks like you showed up in a bad mood.

118
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,409
Now, you're taking it out on that toaster.

119
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,162
No. I'm fixing it.

120
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,582
You've been coming in here
since you were 13...

121
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,542
Here we go.

122
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,877
...to fix shit,
so you don't have to deal with shit.

123
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:22,089
Can you just let me work alone, please?

124
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,259
This have anything to do with what
you said after the sheriff cleaned?

125
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,011
Because Shirley came by last night.

126
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,515
She said you stormed out, yelling,
"He lied!"

127
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:32,641
Don't think I was yelling.

128
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:37,312
You know what? Coming in here,
sitting in that chair, using my tools,

129
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:38,438
that's a privilege.

130
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:42,025
And the only way you get to stay here
is by telling me what in hell's going on.

131
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,655
Okay, then I won't stay.

132
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:51,201
You didn't come here to mend a toaster.
You came here to talk.

133
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,579
I know that's hard for you.

134
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,708
Okay. Take your time.

135
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,511
It's about George.

136
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,598
It's been three months since he died.

137
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,810
- You're saying he lied?
- No. Holston lied.

138
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,188
- You still think George was murdered?
- Yeah.

139
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:22,816
- Yeah, 'cause he didn't kill himself, so--
- How can you be so sure?

140
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:24,818
'Cause the last time I saw him,

141
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,778
<i>he really wanted to show me something.</i>

142
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,907
<i>We were celebrating Cooper
becoming my shadow.</i>

143
00:16:30,741 --> 00:16:33,577
<i>George was always paranoid
'cause we weren't sanctioned,</i>

144
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:34,995
<i>so he never came to these things.</i>

145
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,205
Computer guy!

146
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,082
They're making me get drunk.

147
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,502
Well, it looks like you're
putting up a fight.

148
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,630
Coop, why don't we get you some water
and a chair?

149
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:49,593
Cake?

150
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:05,651
Hey, everyone knows about us.
They don't give a shit.

151
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:07,528
They're not gonna send us to the mines.

152
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,530
You'd be fine down there, tough girl.

153
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,242
Hey, something happened.

154
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:15,993
Something big.

155
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,497
I can't tell you here,
but can I speak to you after?

156
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,040
Yeah, sure. I work until late.

157
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,875
Then I'll tell you at your place.

158
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:22,960
Okay.

159
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:24,837
Everybody!

160
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:27,005
Where's Coop?

161
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,298
Get Coop up here.

162
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,385
This is all about him. Come here.

163
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,221
Coop, I know you're freaking the fuck out.

164
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:40,477
- You are ready to shadow Jules.
- Gotta go.

165
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,980
Let's all give it up for Cooper! Come on.

166
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,078
<i>When I got off work at midnight,
I was exhausted.</i>

167
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,831
<i>I was looking forward to seeing George.</i>

168
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:11,383
George?

169
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:05,812
- Hey.
- Hey.

170
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,606
Well, you don't look too hungover.

171
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,358
I'm not. Just sad.

172
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:11,276
Why?

173
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,988
- You didn't hear?
- I just got up. Hear what?

174
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,074
Computer George went off
the stairs last night.

175
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:20,827
They're saying suicide.

176
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:24,665
Did you know him well?

177
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:43,809
Look, Jules,
I don't know what you want me to say.

178
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,103
I really liked the guy.

179
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:48,730
And suicide is a crime against the Silo.

180
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,567
- I know.
- If you have proof that he didn't jump,

181
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,111
you'd be saving me
a mountain of paperwork. But--

182
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,488
But murder?

183
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,033
And by who? And why?

184
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:03,745
I don't know!
I just know he didn't kill himself, Hank.

185
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,498
Okay, see, for it to be murder,
you need more than that.

186
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:09,293
- You need motive and opportunity.
- Don't fucking patronize me, Hank.

187
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,670
Hey, I'm not patronizing you, it's just...

188
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:16,633
What?

189
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,054
I know you two were...

190
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,434
I figured, down here, who cares?
The thing is,

191
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:28,520
if you were in a sanctioned relationship,
this would be easier.

192
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,022
A partner has certain rights.

193
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,524
Yeah. Well...

194
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,070
Fuck it.

195
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,115
I'll run your concerns Up Top.

196
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:42,826
I'll say it came from a coworker
who knew him well.

197
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:45,412
See what the sheriff has to say.
He's a good man.

198
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,998
Nobody likes a suicide.

199
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,630
Come on!

200
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:12,564
That's her.

201
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,025
- What's her name?
- What?

202
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,152
What's her name?

203
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,154
Juliette.

204
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:21,031
Juliette Nichols.

205
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:36,255
The body was found here,
on this ventilation unit.

206
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:44,346
I'm thinking George must've fallen
maybe 100 feet, give or take.

207
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,390
No witnesses.

208
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,851
So, nothing much more I can give you.

209
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,688
You seem awfully tense.

210
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:55,065
I-- I'm always tense, sir.

211
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:59,736
I get it. Suicide is a serious crime.

212
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:02,698
- No, it wasn't suicide.
- So you've said.

213
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:06,827
Yeah. He wasn't depressed.
He wasn't giving anything away.

214
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:07,911
There was no sudden elation

215
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,414
that he finally made a decision
that he would--

216
00:22:10,414 --> 00:22:14,001
We're all taught those signs so early,
people get good at hiding them.

217
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:15,502
How'd you know him?

218
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:20,299
- George--
- Everybody knows everybody down here.

219
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,677
And George was the funny computer guy.

220
00:22:24,887 --> 00:22:26,346
Why do you think he was murdered?

221
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:27,514
He have any enemies?

222
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,640
I just know he--

223
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,644
I told her, for murder,
you need motive and opportunity and--

224
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,771
Yeah, but I told you we have opportunity.

225
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,982
He died at 3:00 a.m?

226
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,359
No one's on the stairs then. Right?

227
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,946
Unless you're a porter.

228
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,407
Or going to jump.

229
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:48,869
Go to Dispatch, would you?

230
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,496
See if there were any porters
on the stairs when it happened.

231
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:52,581
- Yeah.
- Okay.

232
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,381
That's a nice watch. Is that a relic?

233
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,469
- It's legal.
- Just said it was nice.

234
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,848
Look, I'm sorry about your coworker.

235
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:14,436
I'm gonna go look at his body again.
Check for any signs of a struggle.

236
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:15,521
Okay.

237
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:19,274
Hate to ask, but maybe there's something
you'd see that I don't.

238
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:21,610
But only if you're up to it.

239
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:27,950
No, yeah. Of course. Yeah, sure. Cool.

240
00:23:40,838 --> 00:23:43,423
We're looking for anything unusual.

241
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:49,137
Abrasions that wouldn't be consistent
with a fall. Evidence of a fight.

242
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:54,226
- You ready?
- Yep.

243
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,282
Some people...

244
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:12,244
cut their wrists in previous attempts.

245
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,498
Then they decide to be sure...

246
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,294
so they jump.

247
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:29,261
Even after all these years,
I haven't gotten used to the sight.

248
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:32,222
- You ever seen--
- Dead person? Yeah.

249
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,599
My brother when I was 12.

250
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,227
My mother when I was 13. But, you know,
you knew that, so...

251
00:24:39,938 --> 00:24:42,191
Someone says murder, you look into them.

252
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:44,401
Find out what reason
they might have for saying that--

253
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,361
The reason is 'cause he was murdered.
That's why.

254
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,741
But you might not wanna believe
it's suicide, given your history.

255
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,327
That's something I can understand.

256
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:57,414
Anything new?

257
00:24:58,707 --> 00:24:59,833
Not really.

258
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:01,919
What they say at Dispatch?

259
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:05,047
It was a quiet night for the porters.
Nobody up or down.

260
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,840
- Judicial's on their way.
- Okay.

261
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,134
Possible suicide and all,
they want a briefing.

262
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:12,137
You guys ask around.

263
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,681
See if there was anyone else
on the stairs.

264
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,433
All right.

265
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,359
You want something to eat?

266
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:26,985
No.

267
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,241
How long
were you and George in a relationship?

268
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:35,827
I won't tell anybody.

269
00:25:36,537 --> 00:25:38,497
I don't know what you're talking about.

270
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:41,333
Why didn't you get sanctioned?

271
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:47,464
Why not?

272
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:50,759
Look,
if we're gonna figure out what happened,

273
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,386
you're gonna have to tell me the truth.

274
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:54,263
When you went to my deputy
and said murder,

275
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:56,306
you wanted help, right?

276
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,642
He didn't kill himself.

277
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:00,602
Okay.

278
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:05,607
I gotta go meet with Judicial.

279
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:10,988
Juliette, the not knowing,

280
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:14,408
it's gonna haunt you forever.

281
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,540
He left something for me.

282
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,626
What?

283
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:28,964
You being sheriff and me,
not being sheriff.

284
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:32,134
I need you to promise me
you're not gonna rat me out to Judicial.

285
00:26:32,134 --> 00:26:33,218
Is it a relic?

286
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:36,096
'Cause if it is,
I'm gonna have to confiscate it.

287
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,852
No, he didn't leave me anything.

288
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:43,395
Nothing to show you.

289
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,107
But who's to say where I found it?

290
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:51,028
The Silo's a big place.

291
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:25,687
What is this?

292
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:28,065
I don't know.

293
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:31,068
Maybe it was his way of saying goodbye.
Giving you something.

294
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:37,199
He left this with it.

295
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,538
Where's the rest of it?

296
00:27:42,538 --> 00:27:44,122
That's all there was. I don't know.

297
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:49,294
"Remember where you last saw this?"

298
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:58,762
What I'm about to show you
is more illegal than any relic.

299
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:02,641
I'm sure Up Top knows about it,
but they don't seem to care.

300
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:04,810
I'm from Up Top

301
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,437
and I have no idea where we're going.

302
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,198
Our agreement still apply?

303
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:19,950
Yeah.

304
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:23,787
All right.

305
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:35,632
I hope you're not afraid of the dark.

306
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:40,888
Or tight spaces.

307
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:43,807
Or heights.

308
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:16,006
{\an8}- Who did all this?
- I don't know.

309
00:29:16,715 --> 00:29:18,467
We think it's from before the rebellion.

310
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:24,515
Hey. Careful.

311
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,812
- What's down there?
- You'll see.

312
00:30:12,187 --> 00:30:13,188
Thanks.

313
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:19,236
There were probably
a hundred work lights here at one time.

314
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,115
Only these ones are left.

315
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:26,451
What is that?

316
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:29,746
Best guess is what's left
of the machine that dug the Silo.

317
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:33,584
Theory goes, digger comes down this far,

318
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:35,460
there's no easy way to get it out,

319
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:41,258
so the founders just walled it off
with a 30-foot cap of concrete.

320
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:47,222
Digger must have looked like this for
a hundred years.

321
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,267
Anything of value
has been stripped a long time ago.

322
00:30:51,977 --> 00:30:53,937
First time I saw this place,

323
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:57,274
it made me realize
how little we know about the Silo.

324
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:01,904
Ready?

325
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,242
It's better not to look down.

326
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:15,334
You okay?

327
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:01,880
What is this place?

328
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,590
George.

329
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,759
He put it all together.

330
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:13,141
Last time I saw this thing was down here.

331
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:20,357
Was in this box.

332
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:32,828
These are why he wanted
to keep us a secret.

333
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:36,206
You know, if he ever got caught with them,
he didn't want me sucked in.

334
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,001
Are these all relics?

335
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:41,253
Yeah.

336
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:45,549
I don't know--

337
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:48,468
Never seen this one before.

338
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:52,264
Maybe it's what he wanted you to see?

339
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:53,432
No idea what it is.

340
00:33:00,731 --> 00:33:04,651
So, George sold and traded relics?

341
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:06,862
Yeah.
He was obsessed with the before time.

342
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:09,948
You know, he'd come down here on his own
and he'd be looking for something.

343
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:12,117
- Looking for what?
- I don't know. He never told me.

344
00:33:12,117 --> 00:33:13,952
He just said
that he'd know it if he saw it.

345
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:17,873
That's odd.

346
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:22,586
This plastic wire
used to be wrapped around the spool.

347
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,639
Wait. Hold on.

348
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,141
What is this?

349
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:54,553
What is that?

350
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:00,559
You see any of this before?

351
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:02,269
No.

352
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:06,398
He never mentioned this?
Said what might be on it?

353
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,482
No.

354
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:14,031
"Instructions on
how to recover deleted files."

355
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:19,870
There's handwriting on the back.

356
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:22,206
That's not George's handwriting.

357
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:25,792
It's my wife's.

358
00:35:28,754 --> 00:35:30,380
Do you think your wife knew George?

359
00:35:30,923 --> 00:35:33,842
Allison did some IT work for him
not long before she went out.

360
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:38,013
Why didn't you tell me that?

361
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,520
If George and your w--

362
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,689
Did you talk to him?

363
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:48,899
Once.

364
00:35:53,654 --> 00:35:55,489
Oh, shit. The watch.

365
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:58,700
You'd seen it before, hadn't you?

366
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,536
That's why you checked his wrists.

367
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:05,207
That's why you knew we were together.

368
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,836
<i>Is that why you're here?</i>

369
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:11,213
To see if I had anything to do
with why your wife went out to clean?

370
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:13,090
I came down here
to determine his cause of death.

371
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:15,592
Bullshit! You're wondering
if George had anything to do

372
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:18,011
with why your wife went out to clean.

373
00:36:18,011 --> 00:36:20,764
And I'm gonna have to tell Judicial
his death was an accident.

374
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:23,976
Why? Why would you do that?
He was murdered!

375
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:26,061
- By who?
- I don't know by who!

376
00:36:26,061 --> 00:36:28,313
There's a reason why George hid this.

377
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:31,233
Maybe it'll tell us why--
what happened to him.

378
00:36:31,233 --> 00:36:33,068
I don't know
why he hid a fucking hard drive.

379
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:37,239
This is a red-level relic,
making it a threat to order in the Silo.

380
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:41,034
I don't care about the order in the Silo.
I want you to do your job!

381
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:43,120
Maintaining order in the Silo is my job.

382
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,788
What about finding out the truth?

383
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:48,292
I've gotta get this into the incinerator
before anyone else finds it.

384
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,960
- No.
- That's enough!

385
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:56,675
Maybe if you'd listened to your wife,
she'd still be alive right now!

386
00:37:02,222 --> 00:37:06,894
To get to my office,
I have to walk through the cafeteria.

387
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:10,856
So, now I go to work before dawn,

388
00:37:10,856 --> 00:37:12,566
and I come home after dark

389
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:15,068
just so I don't
have to see her body on that hill.

390
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:19,531
Allison asked questions too.

391
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,206
She was never afraid.

392
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:30,125
Then please... Just...

393
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,711
help me.

394
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:43,555
I'll keep trying to find out
what happened to George,

395
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:46,975
but you have to stay quiet
and you have to keep your head down.

396
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,602
Stop wearing that watch!

397
00:37:48,602 --> 00:37:51,605
It may be legal, but it draws attention.

398
00:37:52,898 --> 00:37:55,526
When I find something, I'll send word.

399
00:37:55,526 --> 00:37:56,610
A signal.

400
00:37:57,152 --> 00:37:58,278
I promise.

401
00:37:58,278 --> 00:37:59,446
What kind of signal?

402
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:00,989
You'll know it when you see it.

403
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:03,116
Anything I can do while I wait?

404
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:05,202
I have to figure out what this is,

405
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:08,747
and you need to trust me.

406
00:38:12,292 --> 00:38:13,502
Yeah.

407
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,464
You actually said
if he'd listened to his wife,

408
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:18,841
she'd still be alive?

409
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:21,802
And you wonder
why you never heard from him again.

410
00:38:23,554 --> 00:38:26,223
Jules, you could've told me this before.

411
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:31,144
- He asked me to wait, so I waited.
- And you got no word, no sign.

412
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,650
Well, I'm sorry you didn't get the answers
you were hoping for,

413
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,944
but maybe you should take a day.

414
00:38:38,944 --> 00:38:43,198
Maybe do something. Take your mind off it.

415
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:45,868
Maybe I should keep my mind on it.

416
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:49,955
I didn't show the sheriff everything.

417
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,633
Bottom half of the note George left me.

418
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:03,886
"I found what I was looking for."

419
00:39:03,886 --> 00:39:06,138
Why didn't you show this to the sheriff?

420
00:39:06,138 --> 00:39:08,223
George told me
that whatever he was looking for

421
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:10,058
was more dangerous than any relic.

422
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,353
He was afraid me even knowing
about it could get me sent out.

423
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:15,230
What was he looking for?

424
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:19,151
Jules, this is getting dangerous.

425
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:24,907
Yeah.

426
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:27,868
I'll fix this later.

427
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:29,953
No, you won't.

428
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:31,580
Yeah. No, I won't.

429
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,001
Okay.

430
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:38,295
Hey.

431
00:39:39,546 --> 00:39:41,715
Try not to get yourself killed down there.

432
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:44,635
Yeah.

433
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,940
<i>I've got the judge's picks for sheriff.</i>

434
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,775
Four mediocre candidates

435
00:39:59,775 --> 00:40:02,319
just to shine a light
on the one she really wants.

436
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:06,073
- Paul Billings.
- I remember him. He was a deputy.

437
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,157
Yeah, in the Mids.

438
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:09,910
He was a good guy
till he abandoned us for Judicial.

439
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,995
He got married and he wanted better hours.

440
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:15,249
To be honest,
Paul Billings wouldn't be the worst.

441
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:17,334
I don't want someone who's not the worst.

442
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:20,629
I keep thinking any minute
someone's gonna come through that door

443
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:23,507
and tell me there's an armed mob
coming up the stairs.

444
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:26,677
And 140 years of peace
is gonna go down the drain.

445
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:30,389
And my next thought is,
I have to go talk to Holston about this.

446
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:33,642
Yeah. I think the same thing
about ten times a day.

447
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:36,645
I wish he'd said who should take the job.

448
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:39,690
He did.

449
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:46,530
- He left a note.
- Why did you wait until now to tell me?

450
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:48,782
Because it's ridiculous, and if anything,

451
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:52,119
it's a sign
he wasn't quite there at the end.

452
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:55,289
- Who'd he choose?
- You might wanna top off your drink.

453
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:02,504
"In my final act as sheriff,
I, Holston Becker,

454
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:06,758
nominate Juliette Nichols of Mechanical
as my successor."

455
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:08,844
- Juliette Nichols?
- She's an engineer.

456
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,139
"Even if she refuses,
I ask that this badge,

457
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,892
my personal property, be given to her.
Holston Becker."

458
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:16,351
Why her?

459
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:19,771
Like I say,
he wasn't in his right mind at the end.

460
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:21,982
I wanna meet her.

461
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:23,692
Are you sure?

462
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,778
I said meet her, not give her the job.

463
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:28,739
I'll message
and have her start up tomorrow.

464
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:31,408
No. I'll go to her.

465
00:41:31,408 --> 00:41:33,619
Oh, yeah? 144 levels?

466
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:36,872
I just sent a sheriff out to clean.

467
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:41,168
I need to walk the Silo.
The people need to see their mayor.

468
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:19,790
<i>You've got a lot of rope.</i>

469
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:22,584
Yeah.

470
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:25,671
What do you need it for?

471
00:42:27,506 --> 00:42:28,924
To get where I'm going.

472
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,759
Okay. Where's that?

473
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:33,846
The past.

474
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:36,014
The past?

475
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:40,602
What are you looking for?

476
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:43,230
Well, what I'm looking for isn't nearly
as important as what I've found.

477
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:46,275
You.

478
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,861
Wow. You idiot.

479
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:52,281
Seriously, what are you looking for?

480
00:42:53,365 --> 00:42:54,908
If I find it, I'll let you know.

481
00:42:54,908 --> 00:42:57,995
- Tell me.
- Get off me-- Okay.

482
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:00,873
I think it's a door.

483
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:06,336
A door?

484
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:08,964
What do you mean, a door?

485
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:12,926
I saw it on an old drawing.

486
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:15,053
It's at the end of a short tunnel.

487
00:43:15,053 --> 00:43:18,140
Well, what's behind it?
How do you even know it's real?

488
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,100
Well, I don't know.
That's why I need to find it.

489
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,853
It's somewhere down at the bottom.

490
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:25,647
At the bottom?

491
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:28,901
There's water. There's water down there.

492
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:30,819
Why would anyone put a door at the bottom?

493
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:34,239
- I know that the water scares you.
- Yeah, it scares me, George.

494
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,325
'Cause you sink in water
and you can't breathe.

495
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:38,827
What if you fall off the rope?

496
00:43:38,827 --> 00:43:41,121
What if you can't get back up again?
What if--

497
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:42,372
I'm gonna be careful.

498
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:47,586
Okay, make me a deal.

499
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:51,006
if you're gonna go down there,

500
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:54,801
I don't wanna know about it until after.

501
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,596
Okay?

502
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,350
Deal.

503
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:04,061
Okay.

504
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:10,794
Okay.

505
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:18,403
No!

506
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:24,326
Fuck.
