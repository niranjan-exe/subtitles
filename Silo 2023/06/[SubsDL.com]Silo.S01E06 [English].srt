1
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,212
[custodian] This guy die or something?
'Cause I get queasy.

2
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,088
If he did, you got to tell me now

3
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,486
'cause I can't be
walking in with no dead body.

4
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:51,885
I do locks and light bulbs.
Blood isn't my thing.

5
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,219
Can you open it or not?

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,303
[custodian] Yeah. I'm trying...

7
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,504
- [Juliette] Mm-hmm.
- ...but these keys aren't working.

8
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,602
Was this Trumbull guy Judicial?

9
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,940
- [Juliette] I'm not at liberty to...
- If so, I'll need a different set.

10
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:06,524
Maybe tomorrow we can come back...

11
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,818
- With the Forgiveness Holiday...
- Is there another way in?

12
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,071
- [custodian] Yeah, but Judge Meadows...
- [Paul] Sheriff. Hey...

13
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,407
- What are you... Wait, what are you...
- [Juliette grunts]

14
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:17,785
[switch clicks]

15
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,872
[custodian]
IT distro probably cut the power early.

16
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:22,270
Yeah, but protocol requires
the power be on...

17
00:01:22,271 --> 00:01:24,668
Can you head to distro
and get the lights back on?

18
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,188
- [custodian] Yeah.
- [Juliette] Great.

19
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,880
You two take the kitchen.
I'm gonna check the bedroom.

20
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,800
- [Molly] What are we looking for?
- [Juliette] For anything strange

21
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,927
that might tell us
why Trumbull killed Marnes.

22
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,641
[cabinet opens]

23
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,728
[objects clattering]

24
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,697
- You go in there yet?
- No. Anything in the front?

25
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:54,948
Not yet.

26
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:09,795
[Paul] What the heck is this?

27
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,092
- What you got?
- Honestly, I don't know.

28
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,137
But, uh... [breathes heavily]

29
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,099
We're gonna need a relics bag.

30
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,759
What are you smiling at?

31
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:22,638
At you, I guess.

32
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,141
[Juliette] You know they call you
Creepy George, right?

33
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,935
They've scratched it on the side
of the generator.

34
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,355
- It says, "Beware of Creepy George."
- Okay. First off...

35
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:33,689
- "He is so creepy."
- ...you shut up. [chuckles]

36
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,902
- You would never allow generator graffiti.
- Yeah, that's true.

37
00:04:36,903 --> 00:04:37,818
And second,

38
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,323
if you'd said, "creepy computer guy,"
I might have believed you.

39
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:44,201
In fact, Creepy George,
if he really is a thing,

40
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,204
probably just another guy.

41
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,416
Am I your only friend? Like,
I know I'm your only friend down here,

42
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:55,087
but am I your only friend
in the entire Silo?

43
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:56,755
'Cause that's pretty sad.

44
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,883
No, no. It's pretty great.

45
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,012
I mean, if I... I... I gotta have one.

46
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,227
You wanna keep that?

47
00:05:11,854 --> 00:05:15,232
What, if I wanna risk going to prison
or sent down to the mines

48
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,943
for one of your strange toys? No.

49
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,864
We already broke into Supply together
so you could have your precious tape.

50
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:26,118
No, so Mechanical and the Silo
could have its necessary tape.

51
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:29,121
- And you, sir, did nothing.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

52
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:30,664
[Juliette] No, no. You drew a map.

53
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,958
A really shitty map.
I did everything else by myself,

54
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,753
including throwing bacon at dogs
and running like crazy.

55
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,213
But for a roll of tape.

56
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,426
George, that tape saves lives, okay?

57
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:45,136
Maybe not IT's shitty tape,

58
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,806
but Mechanical's does,
and that's why I did it.

59
00:05:47,807 --> 00:05:50,893
I didn't take a risk for myself.

60
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,103
I did it for everyone,

61
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,628
and these strange things you have here,

62
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:00,141
they're just not worth risking a life for.

63
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,653
Especially when you don't know
what they are.

64
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,658
If these things aren't worth
risking our lives for,

65
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,245
why do they make it a risk to our lives
to have them?

66
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,333
[inhales deeply] I don't know.

67
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:16,335
Neither do I.

68
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:22,716
These things were used by someone
for something at some point as tools.

69
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,634
I'm gonna use 'em as clues.

70
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:26,302
It's a stupidly dangerous hobby.

71
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,140
And not all of these things are illegal,
by the way.

72
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,808
[with mouth full] Okay.

73
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,354
This...

74
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:43,237
may not appear as valuable as...
[scoffs] ...a refurbished socket wrench

75
00:06:43,238 --> 00:06:48,242
or as romantic as flowers from the Mids.

76
00:06:48,243 --> 00:06:50,619
But to me, this watch...

77
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,665
is everything.

78
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,879
[breathes deeply]
And I want to give it to you.

79
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,640
[rattling]

80
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,642
George, it... it's broken.

81
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:18,897
No, I'm serious. It's like a paperweight
cheaper than the paper it would hold up.

82
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:20,314
It's a gift.

83
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,942
- [inhales deeply, groans]
- [chuckles]

84
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,989
And in a world filled with a million
unknowns, it is possible that this watch...

85
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,741
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and... and crazy relics like these...

86
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,451
- George.
- ...are the key to answering

87
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:33,160
- the Silo's biggest questions.
- George.

88
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,539
Are you not gonna ask
what the Silo's biggest question is?

89
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,165
Just stop talking, please.

90
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,877
Before you fuck it all up.

91
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,049
[ticking]

92
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,368
[lock clicks]

93
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,525
[computer chimes]

94
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,072
[sighing]

95
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,262
[computer processing]

96
00:08:53,263 --> 00:08:55,452
[computer chimes]

97
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:58,914
Shit.

98
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,708
You didn't take that to Judicial?

99
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,125
You're in early.

100
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,503
First day you beat me in.

101
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,547
Is that a note for me?

102
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,508
A porter brought it from Recycling.

103
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,889
Keeping an illegal relic
beyond the 12-hour window

104
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,809
from discovery to Judicial handoff
is a serious crime.

105
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,477
Even for a sheriff.

106
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,662
- How do you know it's illegal?
- [Paul] I know that I don't know.

107
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,047
Clause 75A-11: An investigation
into relics may be conducted

108
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:32,290
by either the sheriff
or the Judicial Department when the re...

109
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:35,534
When the identified relic
is associated with a serious crime.

110
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:37,076
I'd say murder qualifies.

111
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:40,372
You read the next paragraph?
That's only with Judicial's approval.

112
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:41,873
Which means?

113
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,169
If you want a relics investigation,
you have to see Judge Meadows.

114
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,506
I'm hearing that a lot. Why don't they rip
the pages out of the Pact

115
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:51,696
and leave one that says,
"See Judge Meadows"?

116
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:53,885
- [scoffs]
- You've talked to her, right?

117
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:56,325
She'd pass through the office
when I was at Judicial.

118
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,765
But these days,
even when you win the Pact competition,

119
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,266
it's Sims who gives you the pin.

120
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,437
There's a competition
for knowing the Pact?

121
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:04,520
- I won it four times.
- Hmm.

122
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,940
- More than anyone else.
- Of course you did.

123
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,485
But I was just a Judicial regular.

124
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:11,736
You're the sheriff.

125
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:14,281
If you wanna meet with Meadows,
that's another thing entirely.

126
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:17,742
[citizens chattering]

127
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:22,623
[representative] Happy Forgiveness Day.
Today is for unity, family and friends.

128
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,363
- [passerby] Happy Forgiveness Day.
- [Sims] Good morning.

129
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,005
- [Sims] Billings. Sheriff.
- Sims.

130
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,778
- [Sims] How are things?
- [Paul] Good.

131
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,804
- How's Judicial?
- [Sims] Everything is good.

132
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,265
[door lock opens]

133
00:10:58,492 --> 00:10:59,493
[secretary] Judge.

134
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,319
I'm not feeling well,
so let's make this quick.

135
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,510
I'm here about the investigation
into Trumbull.

136
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,678
- I thought that was settled.
- It is.

137
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:22,266
Well, this was found about ten hours ago
by Deputy Billings

138
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:25,561
on a search we did with Deputy Karins.

139
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,144
Where?

140
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,649
Trumbull's apartment.
In the bathroom, sir.

141
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:34,173
[Juliette] I'd like to conduct
a relics investigation

142
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:36,780
as a way to identify possible
offenders, like Trumbull,

143
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:38,740
before they have a chance to act.

144
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:44,329
Judge, the Pact says that the gateway
to disruptive criminal activity

145
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,834
- often starts with unli...
- Unlicensed documents and relics. I know.

146
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,712
But this relic, what is it?

147
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,299
I don't know.
That... That's why I want to look into it.

148
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,259
This didn't belong to Trumbull.

149
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,470
I don't care where you found it.
It isn't his.

150
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:06,101
You are aware we have files on every relic
found within the last 140 years.

151
00:12:06,102 --> 00:12:07,935
Yeah,
but I looked into the database, and...

152
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,523
I wasn't saying "we" meaning all of us.
I mean "we" as in Judicial.

153
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:14,943
We have a far more extensive catalog
of information.

154
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,529
For example,
that watch you wear on your wrist.

155
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,533
In Judicial, we know, I know,
that particular item,

156
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:23,409
despite being in your possession,

157
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,581
is currently registered
to a now-deceased George Wilkins.

158
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,501
A man who you claim was murdered.

159
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,087
Accidents happen.

160
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:38,217
And Sheriff Becker made me realize
that Wilkins' death was one of them.

161
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:40,760
That's why I'd like to open
this investigation.

162
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:43,514
So that we can know those things
that are not in your catalog.

163
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,434
Like the fact that your very close
colleague, Douglas Trumbull,

164
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:49,061
- was a murderer.
- Sheriff Nichols.

165
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:51,271
Judge, if I may?

166
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:52,898
You may.

167
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:57,152
Let's wrap it up. I wanna get home
before I have to fight through a crowd.

168
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:03,366
A relics investigation
is actually a smart play.

169
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,785
Especially today
with the Forgiveness Holiday,

170
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:08,204
people will be more inclined
to turn over items

171
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,083
without facing legal jeopardy.
So, I'm fine with it...

172
00:13:11,084 --> 00:13:13,544
- Okay.
- ...as long as you take Paul with you.

173
00:13:13,545 --> 00:13:15,274
You probably know less of the Pact

174
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:17,004
- than my son does.
- [scoffs]

175
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,133
You'll need a specialist with you
at all times, creating a list.

176
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:23,679
Every offense, every relic
and the names of who has what.

177
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,014
Yeah, of course.

178
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,188
[citizens chattering in distance]

179
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,861
- What's the plan?
- You can head back up. See you in an hour.

180
00:13:38,862 --> 00:13:41,362
Sheriff, with Sims taking interest,

181
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:44,782
Judicial will be watching you
everywhere you go. Every level.

182
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:49,037
Either his guys or the whispering friends
of the Silo. And they could be anybody.

183
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,498
So, like it or not,
today I'm with you all the way.

184
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,628
[inhales deeply] I know a guy who's been
busted for relics, and he owes me one.

185
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:57,713
Let's go.

186
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,265
[citizens chattering]

187
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:24,156
- Ah, fuck me. Who'd I kill this time?
- [Juliette] I've got a relic question.

188
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,700
For someone at this address?

189
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,912
You coming out, or are we going in?

190
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,980
Look, I don't know what Marnes
told you about me, but I'm a simple man.

191
00:14:36,981 --> 00:14:40,297
I paint walls. That's how I make
my living. I don't deal illegal relics.

192
00:14:40,298 --> 00:14:42,049
So, who do I see about legal ones?

193
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,636
Couldn't say.

194
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,096
I don't deal anymore.

195
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,265
Especially things like that.

196
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:51,391
A watch?

197
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,707
- A working watch. Who the fuck are you?
- [Juliette] Hey, hey.

198
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,356
The old guys at least had the decency
to identify themselves.

199
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,316
I'm Deputy Billings.
The new Deputy Sheriff.

200
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:00,325
Like I give a fuck.

201
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,658
Sheriff, I don't know what you're looking
for me to do, okay?

202
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:11,745
But I feel like no matter what I say
or I don't say, you're gonna arrest me.

203
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:13,371
No, not on the Forgiveness Holiday.

204
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,997
Bullshit. You don't arrest me now,

205
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:18,355
you put my name on a list put together
by Judicial-face here. And then what?

206
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:21,713
One day... [stammers]...out of the blue,
I'm just doing law-abiding shit...

207
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:24,340
- Oh, 'cause you're just a simple man.
- Exactly.

208
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,760
Then there's a knock on the door.
You know what? Not even.

209
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,637
Maybe there's just a sheriff
with a crowbar,

210
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,889
and I'm yanked out of my place
for something I didn't do.

211
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,852
- So, no. I don't. I don't know anyone.
- You know what, Kennedy?

212
00:15:34,853 --> 00:15:37,145
This sheriff is the only reason
you're not in jail.

213
00:15:37,146 --> 00:15:39,146
And you are obviously having regrets.

214
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,818
This is not about you.
We're looking into relics.

215
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:49,533
That watch is a very peculiar relic
to be using to investigate all relics.

216
00:15:49,534 --> 00:15:51,034
- And it's on your arm...
- [clears throat]

217
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:52,243
...not in an evidence bag,

218
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:54,580
which makes me believe
that it's personal to you.

219
00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:55,831
And in my experience,

220
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:00,127
people with badges doing things
for personal reasons

221
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:02,421
tend to get other people hurt.

222
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:07,009
So you're giving us a name,
or are we leaving with yours?

223
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,385
[chuckles]

224
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,304
Your choice.

225
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,931
[Patrick inhales deeply] How about this?

226
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:17,686
How about you give me the watch,
I try to sell it, and if I do,

227
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:19,771
I'll give you the name
of the person I sold it to.

228
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:21,106
How about this?

229
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:24,609
Shit. Sheriff.

230
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,152
Hey. All... All right.

231
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,030
I need you and Holston Junior
to stop showing up here, okay?

232
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,909
You know, I saw there's a lot of space
outside your apartment.

233
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,242
Room enough for two beds.

234
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,806
- Yeah.
- We could make ourselves at home.

235
00:16:34,807 --> 00:16:36,370
- We could move in.
- Come back every day?

236
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,540
- [Paul] Every day.
- Or you could give us a name.

237
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,750
[Patrick sighs]

238
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:46,840
There's only one name that I can give you

239
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,425
without destroying my livelihood.

240
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:50,010
- As a painter?
- [Patrick] No.

241
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:55,724
As a man who's had his family destroyed
by this fucking bullshit.

242
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,977
You got a pen, Mr. Billingsley?

243
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:25,503
[lock clicks]

244
00:17:37,349 --> 00:17:40,727
[representative] Travel the Silo.
Today's for unity, family and friends.

245
00:17:40,728 --> 00:17:43,542
Happy Forgiveness Day.

246
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:46,357
[citizens chattering]

247
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,694
[representative] Travel the Silo.
Happy Forgiveness Day.

248
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:01,915
[George] You know, people leave traces.

249
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,586
History is just traces
of a whole lot of people

250
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:08,172
over a whole lot of time.

251
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:13,343
Everything from the... the shirt on my back
to the... the... the shoes on our feet.

252
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:17,931
You know, if we wanted, we could pinpoint
the exact place that it was stitched

253
00:18:17,932 --> 00:18:20,183
- or the person who wore it last.
- Really?

254
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,519
- The exact same?
- Yeah, uh-huh. Yes, the exact same.

255
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,022
- You want tea? Yeah.
- Uh, yeah, please.

256
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:27,232
Sorry. Continue.

257
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,111
- It's fascinating, though, right?
- Yeah. I mean, it's so fascinating.

258
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:34,281
- You don't appreciate that?
- [chuckling] No, I do.

259
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:35,699
[George exhales deeply]

260
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:44,708
Don't you ever think about the world
beyond the Silo?

261
00:18:44,709 --> 00:18:47,002
No. When would I have time to do that?

262
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:51,507
Even now, I'm worried some idiot
is tightening the wrong bolts

263
00:18:51,508 --> 00:18:53,091
or misreading the pressure valve.

264
00:18:53,092 --> 00:18:54,675
You're looking at my beautiful face

265
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,678
and thinking about some idiot
with his pressure bolts.

266
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,638
- Pressure valve.
- Pressure valve.

267
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:01,099
And yeah,
'cause your face kind of looks like one.

268
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,853
[chuckles] Sounds like the kind of thing
women and men in Mechanical dream about.

269
00:19:04,854 --> 00:19:05,938
- Pressure valve.
- Oh, yeah?

270
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:07,230
Oh, definitely.

271
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:10,067
You know, while you're down here
dreaming of your world beyond worlds...

272
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:12,778
- You're the one that showed me this place.
- Yeah.

273
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:17,324
But I'm the one in Mechanical,
keeping you dreamers alive.

274
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:18,784
[George chuckles] Is that so?

275
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,286
Yeah.

276
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,123
'Cause I'm the one
that keeps things running.

277
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:27,209
[ticking]

278
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,011
- This must have taken you hours.
- [straining] Yeah. Time I don't have.

279
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:41,098
So...

280
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,851
why?

281
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:48,772
[breathes deeply]
'Cause when you talk about these things,

282
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:54,570
something ignites in you,
and I can see it on your face.

283
00:19:54,571 --> 00:19:58,532
And I don't see that on a lot of people.

284
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:02,494
And, you know, w-whatever that feeling is,

285
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:06,623
when you feel it, I feel that too.

286
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,920
And it's not just here.

287
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:16,133
It's... It's afterwards.

288
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:21,096
[inhales deeply] It's... [exhales shakily]

289
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:24,682
What I'm trying to say is,
I fixed your watch for selfish reasons

290
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:29,229
'cause I really like the way that I feel
when I make you feel the way that you do.

291
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:32,024
[chuckles]

292
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,234
Hey, how'd you get it working?

293
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:37,613
It was easy to fix once
I'd made the right tools.

294
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:39,865
- You made the tools?
- Yeah.

295
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,327
Juliette Nichols,

296
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:49,124
you are truly... [kisses]

297
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,751
Okay, but shh.

298
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:52,982
- ...incredible.
- [Juliette chuckles]

299
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,255
[citizens chattering in distance]

300
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,718
[Juliette sighs]

301
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:06,600
- [cat owner] I know.
- [cat purrs, meows]

302
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:10,269
Soon, baby. Hmm.

303
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,898
- [knocking]
- [cat meows]

304
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,037
Regina Jackson?

305
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:31,333
Come in.

306
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:38,507
[door closes]

307
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,719
[Regina] Never thought I'd see that again.

308
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,680
I'm sorry, what?

309
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:46,890
That watch.

310
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,519
Huh. You know it?

311
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:54,523
Of course I do.
It belonged to my boyfriend.

312
00:22:23,802 --> 00:22:26,638
So, how is George?

313
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,225
He's dead.

314
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,896
He fell off the stairs a few months ago.

315
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,399
[Regina] Mm-hmm.

316
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:43,113
- [smacks lips]
- [cat meowing]

317
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:47,951
Either of you know George,
or is the watch just something you found?

318
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,622
No, I worked with him
before I became sheriff.

319
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,291
- In Mechanical?
- Yeah.

320
00:22:56,835 --> 00:22:57,835
Mm-hmm.

321
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:01,298
Ms. Jackson, are you in possession
of any relics? Legal...

322
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:03,383
Last time I saw him,
that's where he was headed.

323
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:04,927
Moving on to the next thing.

324
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:06,970
The next person.

325
00:23:10,015 --> 00:23:13,226
No, I don't have any relics. Not anymore.

326
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:17,523
Anything I had, and there was a lot,
I got for him.

327
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,568
Somebody give you my name?

328
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:22,985
Mm-hmm.

329
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:24,488
Happens a lot.

330
00:23:25,364 --> 00:23:28,784
But I'm no dealer.
George had me buying things for him.

331
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:34,206
I come from a big family.
Lots of aunts, uncles, cousins.

332
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:39,378
He figured it would justify
the purchases if Judicial looked into it.

333
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:43,214
He had no one, so he used me to get them.

334
00:23:43,215 --> 00:23:46,260
- All legal items? Or were there...
- Was your relationship sanctioned?

335
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,638
George didn't do sanctioned relationships.

336
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,642
And any fool would see he's not the type
of guy you spend forever with.

337
00:23:56,895 --> 00:24:00,941
Legal? Sure, I guess.
But how does anyone know?

338
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,568
[Paul] You ask.

339
00:24:03,402 --> 00:24:05,611
[Regina]
I walk into a law enforcement agency

340
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:09,616
and ask if the item I now possess
is an illegal possession?

341
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,951
Seems like I'm making it easy for them.

342
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:16,582
Did you see or hear from him
after he went down to Mechanical?

343
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,418
You ask a lot of questions.

344
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,671
Look, Sheriff,

345
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:27,467
George went down to Mechanical to explore
what he called "the big questions."

346
00:24:27,968 --> 00:24:29,260
Illegal questions.

347
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:32,890
He got what he wanted from me.
He didn't need me anymore, so he left.

348
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:38,020
Probably in pursuit of someone new
down deep who could give him a hand.

349
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,064
What illegal questions
are we talking about?

350
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:44,610
I've been over this time and again
with Judicial.

351
00:24:45,736 --> 00:24:48,155
Those aunts and uncles I told you about,
so have they.

352
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:51,074
George and those relics cost me a lot.

353
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:54,953
He lost his family,
but he didn't mind isolating me from mine.

354
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,000
He was good with words.

355
00:25:04,129 --> 00:25:07,173
[Paul] Uh, thank you, uh,
f-for your time, Ms. Jackson.

356
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:10,219
- If you have any questions, we can def...
- [Regina] I do.

357
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:19,561
When he told you he loved you,
did you believe him?

358
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:25,943
Thank you.

359
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:34,992
[door closes]

360
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,079
[citizens chattering]

361
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:49,216
[Paul] There's no way
that woman's all there, right?

362
00:25:49,217 --> 00:25:51,301
Her place is like
the junk room at Recycling.

363
00:25:51,302 --> 00:25:52,928
And the smell of that cat food.

364
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:55,347
You all right?

365
00:25:55,348 --> 00:25:56,849
Yeah, I'm great.

366
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:28,005
[knocking]

367
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:31,466
[Sims] We need the room.

368
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,440
Come on, man.

369
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:50,319
[Bernard exhales deeply]

370
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,617
[door closes]

371
00:26:59,077 --> 00:27:01,746
There's an interview
with a confidential informant

372
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,416
that indicates the relic
you brought in earlier

373
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:06,209
was an illegal possession

374
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,296
belonging to your colleague,
George Wilkins.

375
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,632
I don't understand.

376
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:14,509
According to Judicial records,

377
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,679
a search was conducted
of Wilkins's place before he died.

378
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,224
In that search, they found nothing.

379
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:21,807
[Sims] But last night,

380
00:27:21,808 --> 00:27:25,437
Wilkins's relic mysteriously appeared
in Trumbull's apartment

381
00:27:25,938 --> 00:27:28,190
as a result
of a search coordinated by you.

382
00:27:28,899 --> 00:27:32,110
First time I ever saw that relic
was last night in Trumbull's place

383
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:36,239
- when Billings showed it to me.
- Wait... [stammers]

384
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,701
Sims, George and I were friends.
Beyond this watch...

385
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:40,911
Oh, beyond that?

386
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:43,455
I never received anything from him,

387
00:27:43,956 --> 00:27:46,917
especially something as ridiculous
as that thing.

388
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,217
[Bernard] I have a question.

389
00:27:55,218 --> 00:27:56,801
For Mr. Sims.

390
00:27:56,802 --> 00:28:01,139
On the day Judicial searched
George Wilkins's apartment,

391
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,725
was Trumbull a member of the search team?

392
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:07,980
Mayor, the name of Judicial's search team
members are strictly confidential.

393
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:09,063
You know that.

394
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,607
I am in no way required
to reveal that information

395
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:14,152
to the Sheriff's Department
or the Mayor's Office.

396
00:28:14,153 --> 00:28:16,238
But if Trumbull was on that search team,

397
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:19,490
is it even slightly possible
that he simply thought

398
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:23,453
that the artifact was a harmless curio
and decided to take it home for himself?

399
00:28:23,454 --> 00:28:25,580
You want me to entertain a hypothetical.

400
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:29,209
- I'm not going to do that.
- Theoretically, it is possible. Yes?

401
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:37,154
In your search,
did you find anything to explain

402
00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:41,096
why Trumbull would wanna
murder Marnes and Jahns?

403
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:48,019
- No. Not yet. I...
- No. As far as everybody knows,

404
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:51,857
Marnes and Jahns died of heart issues
brought on by walking the Silo.

405
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,027
Any further investigation
might expose the truth,

406
00:28:55,028 --> 00:28:56,820
and that could prove destabilizing.

407
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:01,511
[inhales deeply]
I know not everyone believes this,

408
00:29:01,512 --> 00:29:05,537
but I've found that some mysteries
are best left...

409
00:29:05,538 --> 00:29:07,789
[inhales deeply] ...unsolved.

410
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:10,834
Mr. Sims.

411
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:23,889
[door opens]

412
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:30,938
[door closes]

413
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:34,608
Thank you for not telling them
about me and George.

414
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:38,237
Did you plant that relic so I'd find it?

415
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:43,742
Your decision could've gotten me jailed
or even sent to clean.

416
00:29:43,743 --> 00:29:45,243
[Juliette]
I wouldn't have let that happen.

417
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:48,413
You brought up my name with them
just as soon as they came at you.

418
00:29:48,414 --> 00:29:53,544
Juliette, I have a family. A wife, a baby.

419
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,463
I know having some Judicial-minded deputy

420
00:29:57,464 --> 00:30:00,300
who lives by every letter of the Pact
can be annoying.

421
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:03,135
But you have to be honest with me.

422
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:07,182
Honest, as if not only your life
but mine depended on it.

423
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:09,226
I'll try.

424
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:12,688
- [Paul] You'll try?
- Yeah. That's what I can do.

425
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,523
Juliette, you're the sheriff of the Silo,

426
00:30:15,524 --> 00:30:17,692
and you can't commit
to being honest with me?

427
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:20,737
Shoot, maybe you and this George guy
were perfect for each other.

428
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,825
- You want honesty?
- I do.

429
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:28,328
Your hands shake.
You have flashes of pain.

430
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:29,245
Sheriff...

431
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:31,039
Under pressure,
you clench your hand so tight,

432
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,666
I'm surprised your fingers don't fall off.

433
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:33,917
You have the Syndrome.

434
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:39,046
And you're hiding it. So, Deputy,
living by the letter of the Pact,

435
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:42,342
you know it's a crime what you're doing,
not reporting yourself.

436
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:44,177
- I do.
- And according to the Pact,

437
00:30:44,178 --> 00:30:47,097
you're in no way qualified
to be in a position of authority,

438
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:49,348
to have access to a firearm,

439
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,978
to detain criminals,
to even be a deputy in this department.

440
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:56,481
There's a way to do this.

441
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,110
And what you're doing now is not it.

442
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:02,988
- You called me dishonest.
- I did not.

443
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:04,363
- No?
- No.

444
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:06,950
I only asked you to be honest,
and if you weren't gonna be,

445
00:31:06,951 --> 00:31:09,661
to let me know
rather than set me up to take the fall.

446
00:31:10,537 --> 00:31:14,291
Everybody in the office says the reason
Holston and Marnes were a great team

447
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:16,001
was because they looked out
for each other.

448
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:17,461
And look what that got them.

449
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,134
[Paul] Good night, Sheriff.

450
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:29,139
[door opens]

451
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:32,184
- Shit.
- [door slams]

452
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,770
- [citizen] Hey. Happy Forgiveness Day.
- Hey.

453
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:36,730
[citizen 2] Happy Forgiveness Day, Deputy.

454
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:38,815
[citizens chattering]

455
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,196
[breathing deeply]

456
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:06,635
How was your day?

457
00:32:10,013 --> 00:32:11,014
I've had better.

458
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:14,977
No lights tonight?

459
00:32:16,937 --> 00:32:21,859
You know, my mother used to tell me
when I was a child that, um,

460
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:25,404
you shouldn't give up on the day,
even at the end of it,

461
00:32:25,405 --> 00:32:26,696
'cause... [inhales sharply]

462
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:30,742
Well, she said that a... a whole day
could be saved with just a smile.

463
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,248
Lukas, you've never had a girlfriend,
have you?

464
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:38,708
Oh, tons.

465
00:32:38,709 --> 00:32:40,168
Not one.

466
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,627
[Lukas] So many.

467
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:46,175
Like, every other level,
there is another lady friend.

468
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:50,344
Oh, and there. See?

469
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:52,055
There see what?

470
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:54,140
Smile. Like my mom said.

471
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:58,103
This was not with you. This was at you.
[breathes sharply]

472
00:32:58,104 --> 00:32:59,229
[Lukas] I'll still take it.

473
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:05,277
You don't have your slate
with you tonight.

474
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:08,279
Well, a cafeteria worker
on my level told me

475
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,490
that, uh, it was gonna be cloudy
this evening, so I...

476
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:12,117
You came up anyway?

477
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:15,746
Yeah, I came to see you.

478
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:21,542
- [Lukas chuckles]
- Wow, that's terrible.

479
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:23,774
- [Juliette] Oh, wow.
- [stammers] That is a good line.

480
00:33:23,775 --> 00:33:26,006
I didn't think it could get worse,
but you found a way.

481
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:28,675
Okay, well, you're still smiling,
so whatever.

482
00:33:28,676 --> 00:33:30,928
Okay, I'll... Take care.

483
00:33:32,054 --> 00:33:34,056
See you tomorrow, Sheriff?

484
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:39,436
- [chuckles, grunts]
- [baby giggling]

485
00:33:44,316 --> 00:33:45,526
[door lock clicks]

486
00:33:48,362 --> 00:33:49,363
[Kathleen] Honey?

487
00:33:49,947 --> 00:33:52,073
[gasps] Who's here? Who's here?

488
00:33:52,074 --> 00:33:53,784
- [Kathleen chuckles]
- [baby giggles]

489
00:33:53,785 --> 00:33:56,662
[Kathleen] Oh! Oh, my goodness.

490
00:33:56,663 --> 00:33:59,540
Mm-hmm. [chuckling] Yeah. [kisses]

491
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:01,208
Yeah.

492
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:04,378
[Kathleen chuckles]

493
00:34:06,964 --> 00:34:08,465
- [softly] Hi.
- Hey.

494
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,471
[Paul groans] Oh, look at you.

495
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:20,267
How was your day? Daddy loves you.

496
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,311
[Kathleen] You okay? Look at your hands.

497
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:24,356
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- [Kathleen] Sit down.

498
00:34:24,357 --> 00:34:25,565
[Paul exhales sharply]

499
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:29,095
- [Kathleen] Honey, please sit.
- [breathing sharply] Okay.

500
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,114
[Kathleen] Yeah.

501
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:36,743
Take off your shirt.
Did you eat the ginger root I gave you?

502
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:39,454
[Paul] I couldn't.

503
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:42,622
I wasn't alone at all today.

504
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,793
[Kathleen sighs]
She had you with her all day?

505
00:34:44,794 --> 00:34:45,878
[Paul] Mm-hmm.

506
00:34:46,712 --> 00:34:47,920
Finally trust you?

507
00:34:49,715 --> 00:34:52,425
I don't think she's the trusting type.
[sighs]

508
00:34:52,426 --> 00:34:55,637
She'll come around.
She should be honored to have you.

509
00:34:58,348 --> 00:35:00,017
[sighs]

510
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:22,706
Honey, has it happened yet?

511
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:24,458
[Kathleen] What's that?

512
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:27,419
Have you seen any signs in Claire?

513
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:30,214
You know it doesn't work that way.

514
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:33,467
Just because you have it
doesn't mean she will.

515
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,552
But I worry.

516
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:37,846
[Kathleen] I know.

517
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:45,312
But right now, let's just worry
about getting you fixed up

518
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:48,232
so that you can get some sleep.

519
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:51,568
[Paul sighs]

520
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:57,032
Kath.

521
00:35:57,658 --> 00:36:00,577
- Honey, you don't need to...
- I'm thankful for you and Claire.

522
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:07,251
I can't imagine life in the Silo
if I was all by myself.

523
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:11,505
[Paul breathes heavily]

524
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:13,465
[kisses]

525
00:36:18,971 --> 00:36:20,973
[Juliette breathing deeply]

526
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,568
[exhales deeply]

527
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:37,948
- George?
- Mmm?

528
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:40,534
What's the big question?

529
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,413
Hmm. There's a lot of them.

530
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,459
What's outside?

531
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,798
What's beyond what the sensor can see?

532
00:36:57,092 --> 00:36:58,552
Why are we here?

533
00:36:59,261 --> 00:37:01,805
How long have we been here?

534
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:06,310
How much time do we have left?

535
00:37:10,063 --> 00:37:12,107
But what's the biggest one?

536
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:17,988
[George breathes deeply]

537
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:22,283
What if everything you know to be true,

538
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:26,205
everything you've been told
by the people you love...

539
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:27,998
[clicks tongue]

540
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:34,087
...was in fact just one big lie?

541
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:48,602
[Juliette exhales deeply]

542
00:37:48,603 --> 00:37:50,687

00:38:22,553 --> 00:38:24,012
Yeah, it's so quiet.

550
00:38:27,558 --> 00:38:28,934
It's time to come home.

00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:38,652
Yeah. [sniffs] In the morning,
I'm gonna do what you said.

555
00:38:39,403 --> 00:38:41,572
I'm gonna turn in the badge
and resign.

557
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:47,244
S-So did you figure out
what happened?

- [radio static, clicking]
- [chuckles]

559
00:38:50,081 --> 00:38:51,832
No, couldn't give a fuck.

560
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,461
Turns out the person I was doing it for
wasn't worth the trip,

561
00:38:56,462 --> 00:38:57,546
- so...
- [radio clicks]

562
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:02,509
[stammers] So did you leave here
and go all the way up top for him

563
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,637
or 'cause it was the right thing to do?

564
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:10,392
I mean, shit, the man's dead.
He didn't ask you to go up there.

565
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:15,689
- [radio clicks]
- It's just... It's a waste of time.

566
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,566
[scoffs] Time?

567
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:21,278
You got no concept of time.

568
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,614
You think you do, but you don't.

569
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,409
<i>It's 'cause you got a whole lot more
ahead of you than behind.</i>

570
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:30,912
<i>Time to you is just an idea.</i>

571
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:37,127
<i>To me, it's years spent trapped
behind a closed door with memories.</i>

572
00:39:37,128 --> 00:39:39,963
<i>All your friends and loved ones
somewhere out there,</i>

<i>the other side of it.</i>

574
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,176
You can talk to me about time

575
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:47,596
when you can't
bring yourself to step out the door.

576
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:52,518
When seconds have become years.

What kind of a person are you?

581
00:40:02,694 --> 00:40:04,320
The man you loved was murdered,

582
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:09,535
and now you're saying it's a waste of time
to find out why?

583
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:16,874
See, I don't know what happened,

584
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:20,212
but when you left here,
love had you trying to do the right thing.

585
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:24,007
And now anger is making you give up?

586
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:27,553
<i>Fear did the same thing to me.</i>

587
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:31,390
And that is a waste of time.

00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,356
You're welcome to come here and join me.

You're going to be honest with me
this time.

596
00:41:41,753 --> 00:41:42,835
What was I before?

597
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:45,881
You're the confidential informant,
the rat who gave up George.

598
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:48,717
You're the one
who told Judicial about the hard drive.

599
00:41:48,718 --> 00:41:50,969
It's 'cause of you George is dead. Regina!

600
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:54,348
- Just give me a second.
- Give you a second?

601
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:56,641
You come to my door,

602
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:59,645
- and you accuse me of betrayal.
- You told Judicial about George.

603
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:02,230
- No, not them.
- No?

604
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:04,900
Judicial come during the day.
They ask the easy questions.

605
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:07,736
But the man who knows everything,
he comes at night.

606
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:10,948
- What? What are you ta...
- [shushes]

607

[fan clanking, whirring]

608
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,875
One night, I wake up,
and there's a man in my bedroom.

609
00:42:21,876 --> 00:42:23,877
I can't see anything.
The lamp's been unplugged.

610
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:25,920
And he tells me t-to not move.

611
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:27,505
He wants me to tell him everything.

612
00:42:27,506 --> 00:42:30,883
- To give up everybody, not just George.
- Regina, what do you...

613
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:33,887
For every one question I wouldn't answer,
he'd threaten two people I loved.

614
00:42:33,888 --> 00:42:38,392
Two people I loved. My friends, my family.

615
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,893
If I left the apartment,

616
00:42:40,894 --> 00:42:43,145
he'd turn up at night
at the foot of my bed in the darkness,

617
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:46,483
and he would recite the names of everyone
that I had talked to that day.

618
00:42:46,984 --> 00:42:48,402
Everyone I had talked to.

619
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:50,737
If I had visitors...

620
00:42:52,197 --> 00:42:56,076
Look, I put these up to block the sound.
I don't know if it works.

621
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:59,204
- Even with them, he may hear every word.
- Who is "he"?

622
00:42:59,205 --> 00:43:00,872
Regina, who are you talking about?

623
00:43:00,873 --> 00:43:04,626
They know how to get to you.
They know what you fear.

624
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,921
My mother...

625
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:14,303
every name I gave that man was another day
she didn't have to spend in the mines.

626
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:18,974
So yeah, I gave up
the names of every relic dealer I knew.

627
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:26,732
That's why Kennedy gave me your name.
Because he knew Judicial already had it.

628
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:31,777
Well, hopefully they all know
so they'll stay away from here.

629
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:34,489
- But if you cared for George...
- He only cared about himself.

630
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:37,471
Hey, George is dead
'cause you gave up his name.

631
00:43:37,472 --> 00:43:40,454
He is dead
'cause he didn't give up the hard drive.

632
00:43:40,455 --> 00:43:42,247
Oh, the fucking hard drive.

633
00:43:43,415 --> 00:43:45,834
- Regina, what's on the hard drive?
- Don't ask.

634
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,712
What's on the drive?

635
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:52,799
I never saw.

636
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:56,303
[Juliette breathes heavily]

637
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,021
He never really cared about me.

638
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,775
He used me to get it for him.

639
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:12,610
Probably did the same to you,

640
00:44:12,611 --> 00:44:14,571
pretending to love you
to get what he wanted.

641
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:18,534
I didn't give it to him.

642
00:44:19,993 --> 00:44:21,787
Then he gave me something from his mother.

643
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,748
The only thing he kept of hers.

644
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,793
What did he give you?

645
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,552
These things, these objects, all this...

646
00:44:38,971 --> 00:44:40,222
stuff.

647
00:44:44,726 --> 00:44:46,770
Because of it, I have nothing.

648
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:53,819
I have no one.

649
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:05,017
I, um...
I'm sure the hard drive's been destroyed,

650
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:08,792
so I don't think
they're gonna disturb you anymore.

651
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:11,211
Neither will I, so...

652
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:25,976
Hey, um...

653
00:45:28,478 --> 00:45:30,397
what did George give up
for the hard drive?

654
00:45:30,398 --> 00:45:32,149
You said he gave you something.

655
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:36,027
What is it?

656
00:45:36,028 --> 00:45:37,738
It's everything.

657
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:41,825
I don't think they know it exists.

658
00:45:44,286 --> 00:45:46,245
They search and toss my place.

659
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:51,043
They look under the mat,
but they just toss the damn thing aside.

660
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:01,802
What is that?

661
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:07,142
This is a gift from George's mother,
given to him by his aunt, Gloria.

662
00:46:07,143 --> 00:46:10,145
This was passed down
and hidden for generations.

663
00:46:10,146 --> 00:46:12,523
[softly] Is this before the rebellion?

664
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:17,528
Was before the Silo.
Before there was a reason to lie.

665
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,747
When you see what you'll see,
don't speak it out loud.

666
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:30,624
Don't let them hear.

667
00:46:32,459 --> 00:46:35,087
This will get you killed.

668
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:14,413
You have to wake him up.

669
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:18,458
But it's the middle of the night.

670
00:49:18,459 --> 00:49:20,919
I know, but he has to see this.

671
00:49:22,796 --> 00:49:23,797
Now.
