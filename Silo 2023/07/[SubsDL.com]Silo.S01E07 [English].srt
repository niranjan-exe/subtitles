00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,058
Mommy, how far does it go?

00:00:58,059 --> 00:00:59,476
[Gloria] Forever.

- [child groans, shrieks, laughs]

00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,821
Gloria.

8
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,490
Gloria.

9
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,496
No.

10
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,208
No.

11
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:29,423
I... I... I have to go back.

00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:31,341
[breathing heavily]

13
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,552
[softly] One sec.

14
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,388
Where...

15
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,515
Where's the water?

16
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,351
It's right here.

17
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,415
[Gloria breathes heavily]

18
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,980
[nurse] You missed a dose.

19
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,733
That's all.

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,943
[Gloria groans]

21
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,325
I have to find them. [exhales heavily]

22
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:57,451
It's okay.

23
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,453
You're okay.

24
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,541
[breathing heavily]

25
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,843
[Diego] She's taking it with her.

26
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:40,846
Should we send someone?

27
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,226
No. Leave it.

28
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,020
Are you sure?

29
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,522
Keep following her.

00:05:58,567 --> 00:05:59,610
[Juliette] Morning.

00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,322
- [computer beeps]
- How's the baby?

36
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,534
She's good.

37
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,043
- [computer chimes]
- [inhales deeply] You've got messages.

38
00:06:16,044 --> 00:06:17,878
First one's an apology from maintenance.

39
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,004
For what?

40
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,299
It says they broke your vase,
and they've taken it to be repaired.

41
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,135
Why were they there in the first place?

42
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,929
I don't know how things are
in the Down Deep,

43
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,724
but up here we learn early not to question
the workings of maintenance

44
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:32,559
unless you want your toilet
to stop working.

45
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,394
Down in Mechanical,
we fix things ourselves.

46
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,561
Uh, I'm heading out for a bit.

47
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,960
And you're not gonna tell me
where you're going.

48
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:40,359
Something I need to take care of
in the Mids.

49
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:44,320
[inhales sharply] There's another message.

50
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:47,449
"Mayor Holland requests meeting
with Sheriff Nichols first thing this a.m.

51
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,866
Please acknowledge receipt."

52
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,787
- Well, acknowledge it.
- So, I should tell him you're on your way.

53
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:53,871
Tell him I'll have to reschedule.

54
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,166
You're gonna brush off the mayor
a day after the holiday

55
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,730
with the whole Silo still on edge.

56
00:06:57,731 --> 00:06:59,293
I'm not worried about the mayor,

57
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:02,055
just like I'm not worried about
leaving you in charge for a few hours.

58
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,342
[Molly on radio]
Karins for Billings. Do you copy?

59
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,625
[Juliette] You should get that.

60
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,931
[Paul sighs]

61
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,267
Billings.

62
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,353
[citizens chattering]

63
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,955
- [nurse] Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm looking for Gloria Hildebrandt.

64
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,372
- She here?
- I'm sorry.

65
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,458
I'm not authorized
to give out that information.

66
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:39,793
You're... Why not?

67
00:07:41,044 --> 00:07:43,005
- Like I said, I'm not authorized.
- Authorized. Right.

68
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:44,840
Do you see this? This...

69
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,676
Wait, hold on.

70
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,679
This makes me authorized to know, right?

71
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,142
- So, is she here or not?
- [stammers] Um, she is, Sheriff.

72
00:07:55,143 --> 00:07:57,227
Great. I want to ask her some questions.

73
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,772
I'll take you back,
but you should be prepared.

74
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:01,857
For what?

75
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,485
Uh, you might not get
the answers you're hoping for.

76
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,410
Gloria, you have a visitor.

77
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,747
Gloria, I'm, uh, Sheriff Nichols.

78
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:18,498
I found them.

79
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,876
She suffers from hallucinations.

80
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,671
They're a symptom of her condition.
Advanced vascular dementia.

81
00:08:24,672 --> 00:08:28,509
[Gloria]
Right where I left them by the water.

82
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,637
What... What water?

83
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,681
[nurse] Uh, it's best not to disturb her.

84
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:45,025
The water they don't want us
to know about.

85
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:48,027
She gets agitated,
says things that make no sense.

86
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,239
- [shushes] Wait.
- We keep her as comfortable as possible.

87
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,864
I wanna take her for a walk.

88
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:55,118
Gloria, would you like that?
Would you like to go for a walk with me?

89
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,538
No, that's not possible.
She's not cleared to leave the ward.

90
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:59,747
- I will clear it, okay?
- You can't.

91
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,708
- There's an order to keep her here.
- By who?

92
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,918
Judge Meadows.

93
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,925
If there's nothing else,
I think you should leave.

94
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,316
[Kath] Excuse me, Deputy.
I'd like to report a crime.

95
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:28,214
My husband forgot his lunch this morning.

96
00:09:28,215 --> 00:09:30,112
I'll make sure he's apprehended, ma'am.

97
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:31,509
[Kath] Hmm.

98
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,906
[both chuckle]

99
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,556
[whispering] Oh, my God.

100
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:38,662
- [shushes]
- Oh, shit.

101
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:40,496
Hey.

102
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,998
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

103
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,000
You didn't have to come all the way
up here.

104
00:09:44,001 --> 00:09:46,002
I wanted to show off
how important her daddy is.

105
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,506
- Guess she's not too impressed. [chuckles]
- As long as she's not crying.

106
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:50,674
[chuckles]

107
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,969
Was hoping to meet the sheriff.
Where is she?

108
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,804
Yeah. Your guess is as good as mine.

109
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,805
Ah, forget it.

110
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,892
I could use a break. You want a coffee?

111
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:01,747
Always.

112
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:02,895
Come on.

113
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,647
I'll be in the cafeteria if you need me.

114
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,565
I need the sheriff.

115
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,286
- [Paul] Uh, she's not here.
- It's an emergency. [breathing heavily]

116
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,155
[grunts, sighs]

117
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:16,950
[Paul on radio] Billings to sheriff.
Do you copy? Billings to sheriff...

118
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,499
[secretary] Ma'am. Ma'am.

119
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,876
Ma'am, I told you.

120
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:29,546
- I told you she's not in.
- Where is she then?

121
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,550
Like I said, if you want to see the judge,
you request an appointment.

122
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:35,219
I don't need one. I'm the sheriff.

123
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,096
An appointment is part
of the protocol that comes...

124
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:39,848
I don't give a shit about protocol.

125
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,558
Okay, if she's not here, I'll wait.

126
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,521
- You'd be wasting your time.
- That's not your problem, is it?

127
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,316
She's out sick with a cold.

128
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:51,735
[sighs] When will she be back?

129
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,737
When she's feeling better.

130
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,699
- Uh, all deputies report to 26. All de...
- [grunts]

131
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
- [Paul] Sorry.
- [groans]

132
00:10:58,701 --> 00:10:59,617
They're outta control.

133
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,118
- We're handling it.
- Like hell you are.

134
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,997
Sheriff Nichols,
if you hear me, come to 26 now.

135
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:05,331
Damn it. [stammers]

136
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,959
Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

137
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,796
Sheriff's department. Out of the way.
Move, move. Sheriff's department.

[citizens clamoring]

- I don't know.

140
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,470
Hey, excuse me. Sheriff's department.

141
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:22,224
- Sheriff's department. Excuse me.
- Get out of the way. Coming through.

142
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:24,685
I'm trying to pass... I'm trying
to pass you. Sheriff's department.

143
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:27,771
Sheriff's department.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

144
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:29,231
Hey! Sheriff's department.

Ow.

- What's going on?
- [Molly] There you are.

157
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:06,475
- Where have you been?
- What's happening?

158
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,687
If you hadn't turned off your radio,
you wouldn't have to ask.

159
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:09,771
Shit. I...

160
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,654
- The bar on 26 was trashed last night.
- By who?

161
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,781
The owner says a group
from the lower Mids.

162
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,908
They got too rowdy last night.
He cut 'em off.

163
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,493
When he showed up this morning,
he jumped to his own conclusions.

164
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,665
By the time we got there, the entire floor
was ready to tear each other apart.

165
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,586
The people are scared and they're angry,
and they need their sheriff.

166
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:34,504
- Billings.
- I'm not done.

167
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:36,672
In addition
to getting an elbow to the face,

168
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,260
I had to cover for you when the mayor
turned up asking why you never showed.

169
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:41,552
I lied for you.

170
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,847
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- We're past that.

171
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,433
You have to come clean right now.

172
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:51,772
I want a reason why you are neglecting
your duties and dishonoring that badge.

173
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:54,252
- Otherwise, I have no choice...
- George Wilkins was murdered.

174
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:55,943
What?

175
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:00,509
Just like Jahns and Marnes and Trumbull.

176
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,980
Trumbull?
You told Judge Meadows he jumped.

177
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:05,452
Yeah,
'cause that is what she wanted to hear.

178
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,162
[sighs]

179
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:09,289
You want me to be honest with you?

180
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,563
I have no idea what I'm doing. Okay?

181
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:16,003
I came up here 'cause of George,

182
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:19,424
and the only thing I figured out is
that the man that I love...

183
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:23,052
He lied and he used me,

184
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,222
and I just still want to find out
why he got killed.

185
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,058
And now that somehow is connected
to Jahns, to Marnes,

186
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,312
to why Holston went out
and to why his wife before that went out.

187
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:33,938
So you're asking me to look the other way

188
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:37,526
as you pull on a thread that's connected
to four murders and two cleanings?

189
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:38,526
Yes.

190
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,373
[inhales sharply]
George Wilkins's case was closed.

191
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,083
That is...

192
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,129
until we found one of his relics
in Trumbull's apartment,

193
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,381
which is related
to our larger relics investigation.

194
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:07,139
So, technically it can be seen
as an opening to reexamine George's case.

195
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,517
Thank you.

196
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,936
Thank the Pact.

197
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,502
And just promise you'll see the mayor?

198
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:18,692
I'll see the mayor. First thing tomorrow.

199
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:26,491
You should go home.
You... You look like crap.

200
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:32,497
- [Paul sighs]
- One more thing. Um...

201
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:34,833
Do you know where Meadows lives?

202
00:14:36,877 --> 00:14:39,170
I'd ask why, but something tells me

203
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:41,840
this is one of those moments
I'm supposed to look the other way.

204
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,679
Level 15. Manager's Row.

205
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:52,017
If you want to get in her good graces,
she has breakfast delivered every morning.

206
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,978
She likes bacon and eggs.

207
00:14:58,982 --> 00:14:59,982
[sighs]

208
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:03,654
[door closes]

209
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,782
[machinery whirring]

210
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,627
I was on my way
when I saw your lights in the sky.

211
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,419
They're gone now.

212
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,675
Oh. They're not gone. They're just hiding.

213
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,594
You're not a fan of mushrooms, I take it?

214
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:33,225
Just 'cause we live underground
doesn't mean we have to eat fungus.

215
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,790
- I think they're pretty good, actually.
- Hmm.

216
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:39,356
- Mmm.
- Well, guess we could agree to disagree.

217
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,193
What do you do when you're not here?

218
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,780
Uh, I'm a systems analyst.

219
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,116
- You work in IT?
- Mm-hmm.

220
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,202
And whatever
computer problems you're having,

221
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:54,288
I promise that they are not my fault, so...

222
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,288
Mmm.

223
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,834
So you knew Mayor Holland
before he became mayor?

224
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:03,422
Oh. "Know" is a bit of a stretch,
you know?

225
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:05,798
He once lectured me

226
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,428
on the proper protocol for unplugging
a toaster in the break room, and so...

227
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:12,389
- Yep, that sounds like him. Hmm.
- Hmm. [chuckles]

228
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,974
- There. Look.
- Where?

229
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:15,705
[Juliette] See?

230
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:18,948
- Oh, uh...
- Oh.

231
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:22,191
I think that is here,

232
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:28,155
which means there should be
another one there.

233
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:33,869
Wonder how long they've been there...

234
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,624
like, if they've always been there...
Even before,

235
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,459
when people used to live outside.

236
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,963
Wondered the same thing. [chuckles]

237
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,717
Have you ever noticed anything strange,
besides the lights in the sky?

238
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,512
- What do you mean?
- Like a clue

239
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,805
to what it was really like out there?

240
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,560
Mmm. [inhales deeply]

241
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,772
No, but, uh...

242
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:07,778
Well, there was this one time that, uh,

243
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:13,992
I saw a light move across the sky
and then disappear.

244
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:21,708
[kisses]

245
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:24,670
Uh...

246
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,318
- Uh, hey, um, I'm sorry.
- Enough, wait, um...

247
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,623
Uh, I thought that
because of what I said yesterday

248
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:32,928
- about wanting to...
- It's okay. I shouldn't have...

249
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:34,388
Um, I'm gonna go.

250
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:35,848
[Lukas sighs]

251
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:37,974
[Lukas stammering]

252
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,434
No, it's okay. I've got it.

253
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,568
[Juliette sighs]

254
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,430
[no audible dialogue]

255
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,985
[Bernard] We have a problem.

256
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,819
Okay.

257
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:15,696
I've received a threat.

258
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,573
- What?
- No, it's not, um...

259
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,492
No, I'm gonna get you a security detail.

260
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:21,745
Uh, Sheriff,
I know it's not your inclination,

261
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:24,998
but I need you to listen.

262
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,627
Have a seat.

263
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,759
The other day, after Sims accused you
of planting evidence,

264
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,012
I was informed
that Judge Meadows was not pleased

265
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:41,265
with my intervention on your behalf.

266
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,813
She sent Sims with a warning that
if I were to obstruct her efforts again,

267
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,610
she would use some contortion of the Pact
to remove me.

268
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:01,493
Years ago, I... [sighs]
...made a choice to stay out of her way.

269
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,328
To protect your job.

270
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:04,662
Of course.

271
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:09,585
But my job in IT isn't any job.

272
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:15,048
I know you think it's the generator
that keeps the Silo running...

273
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:17,467
'Cause it is.
'Cause without power, we have nothing.

274
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:20,053
It's how the power is used.

275
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:25,892
To water crops,
transmit messages, to circulate air.

276
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:30,814
All of these invisible functions
are controlled by the servers in IT.

277
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:36,862
Now, if the servers were to fall into
the hands of the wrong person,

278
00:20:38,322 --> 00:20:41,366
no amount of power
from the generator would matter.

279
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:44,536
Do you think Meadows would hijack
the servers?

280
00:20:44,537 --> 00:20:47,706
I know I don't want to wait around
to find out.

281
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:53,795
We need to find something
that we can use to wall her in,

282
00:20:53,796 --> 00:20:56,798
to keep her from stepping
outside her bounds.

283
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,679
There is something I've been looking into.

284
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:04,847
What is it?

285
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:08,227
According to the Pact,
I can't discuss ongoing investigations.

286
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:10,479
[chuckles] You sound like Billings.

287
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:13,023
He's not so bad.

288
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:16,193
He's your replacement.

289
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,322
Whatever it is you're onto,

290
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:25,994
I hope you get to the bottom of it
before Judge Meadows gets rid of you.

291
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:28,914
Because as soon as she does,

292
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,292
there's nothing either of us can do
to stop her.

293
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,880
[Meadows] Leave it there, Carl.

294
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:38,297
Not Carl.

295
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,759
It's the sheriff.
I'm here with your breakfast.

296
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:43,262
Leave it and go.

297
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,868
I wanna ask you some questions.

298
00:21:46,869 --> 00:21:48,600
[Meadows sighs] I'm not well.

299
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:53,146
My first one has to do with your policy
of locking up citizens

300
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:55,482
and then drugging them against their will.

301
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:09,580
[door closes]

302
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,793
I wasn't expecting company.
I've been sick.

303
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,422
Yeah. That's what your secretary said.

304
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:24,052
Didn't stop you from forcing your way
in here and violating my privacy.

305
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,514
Don't worry. You'll get it back.

306
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:31,977
As soon as you tell me why you're keeping
Gloria Hildebrandt captive in Medical.

307
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,020
Who?

308
00:22:34,021 --> 00:22:35,606
The fertility counselor.

309
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,276
Oh, her.

310
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:41,445
It's for her own good.

311
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:44,948
You're drugging her 'cause you think
she said something to Allison Becker

312
00:22:44,949 --> 00:22:46,407
that made her want to go out.

313
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,160
I don't know
where you're getting all this.

314
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:49,452
In Gloria's file.

315
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:53,916
Gloria said to her that she's not the type
the Silo wanted having children,

316
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:55,125
so I wanna talk to her.

317
00:22:55,126 --> 00:22:56,418
Why?

318
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,594
The relic investigation,
the one you approved.

319
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:03,717
She's been on your watch list for years.
I figured she might know something.

320
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:05,384
You're not a good liar, Sheriff.

321
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,512
Then let me talk to her,
and I'll leave you alone.

322
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:10,598
- I'm not stopping you.
- Her brain is filled with drugs.

323
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,684
Gloria doesn't have dementia any more
than you have a cold.

324
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:19,316
Oh. So, not satisfied with sheriff,
a post that you're not qualified to fill,

325
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:21,818
- you're now diagnosing people?
- You don't want me to be sheriff.

326
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:23,319
I want to talk to Gloria.

327
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,239
So why don't you lift
whatever medical order she's under,

328
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,159
and then I'll turn in my badge
by the end of the week.

329
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,290
I want you to go
before I summon Judicial security.

330
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,792
Don't threaten me with Sims.

331
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,627
I'm making you a good offer.

332
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:42,088
Let me take Gloria out of Medical
for a few hours,

333
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,424
and then I'll be back down in Mechanical
before you know it.

334
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:46,760
- It's not possible.
- Course it is. You lift the order.

335
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:48,511
I can't.

336
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,805
You're the judge.

337
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:55,936
I said I can't, and there isn't anything
that I can do about it.

338
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,231
You need to stop doing what you're doing.

339
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:02,693
Not until I find out what I wanna know.

340
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:08,240
[clicks tongue, inhales deeply]
They'll never let you.

341
00:24:08,241 --> 00:24:09,825
Who will not let me? What do you mean?

342
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:11,701
Who are they?

343
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:12,870
[Meadows slurps]

344
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:15,998
[sighs]

345
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,001
Is this how it works?

346
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:23,630
[Meadows swallowing, inhaling sharply]

347
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,717
The apartment, the relics...

348
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,846
You get to keep them
as long as you're quiet?

349
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:36,267
Wow.

350
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:39,229
No wonder you stay in here,
drinking your cold medicine.

351
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:42,441
[sighs] You don't know anything about me.

352
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:44,568
Now get out!

353
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,496
- [Sims] Stop.
- [mouse clicks]

354
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,629
Nichols visited Hildebrandt in Medical?

355
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,339
- Yesterday.
- Show me.

356
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,551
[watcher 1 clears throat]

357
00:25:13,222 --> 00:25:14,848
How long have those been there?

358
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,935
- They were there yesterday.
- You should have told me.

359
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:20,020
Sorry, sir. We'll send someone in.

360
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,525
[citizens chattering]

361
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,251
[Pete] Jules?

362
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:46,505
[sighs]

363
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:51,301
Y... You wanna come in?

364
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:55,555
[light switch clicks]

365
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:57,975
They transferred me here after...

366
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:05,482
It's small, but I'm only here to sleep.

367
00:26:05,483 --> 00:26:07,692
[breathing shakily]

368
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:13,031
I've thought so many times about...
[stutters]...what I'd say to you if you...

369
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:14,115
if you came back.

370
00:26:14,116 --> 00:26:16,201
And now you're here,
I don't even know where to start.

371
00:26:16,202 --> 00:26:17,910
Don't worry about it.
That's not why I'm here.

372
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:20,914
I, uh... I want to ask you for a favor,
and then I'll be out of your way.

373
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:22,498
That's not what I want.

374
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,584
There's a patient in long-term care,

375
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:28,797
um, and I need you to help me get her
out of there for maybe one, two hours.

376
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:30,506
Whoa, just... [stammers]
...hold on a minute.

377
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,717
I think she's being held and drugged
against her will.

378
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,928
I need the drugs to wear off,
so I can find out why.

379
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:37,139
[shushes]
You shouldn't be talking like that.

380
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,142
It's dangerous. I can't do that.

381
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:45,439
Yeah. Yeah, I should have known
you wouldn't come through.

382
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:48,358
[door opens]

383
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:49,401
Wait.

384
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,540
[sighs]

385
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:07,919
- Oh.
- Oh... [chuckles]

386
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,381
Sorry, Doctor. [chuckles]
I didn't hear you coming.

387
00:27:11,382 --> 00:27:14,843
I, uh... I just came to raid
your medicine cabinet.

388
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:16,970
I'll get the inventory sheet
for you to sign.

389
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:18,305
I just came to nab two aspirin.

390
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:22,559
I thought I could tough it out,
but this headache has other plans.

391
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,644
[chuckles]

392
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:26,146
I'm heading home for the night.

393
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,022
Help yourself.

394
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:29,024
Thank you.

395
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:02,891
Gloria, can you hear me?

396
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:06,061
I've come to take you for a walk.

397
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,023
How would you like to visit the nursery?

398
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:13,902
[whispering] Babies.

399
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,118
[door closes]

00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:25,455
[gasps]

401
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:41,555
[baby fusses]

402
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:55,569
- Did anyone see you?
- I don't think so.

403
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,155
[panting] We're safe now.

404
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:01,157
I don't know why,
but they don't listen in here.

405
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:05,704
Gloria? Gloria, do you remember me?
I'm the sheriff. We met yesterday.

406
00:29:05,705 --> 00:29:07,997
- They've got her on a sedative.
- Yeah, I know. I told you.

407
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:11,084
Well, it could take five or six hours
for it to flush through her system.

408
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:12,251
- [sighs]
- We got to get her back

409
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,629
- before the night nurse starts his rounds.
- Fuck.

410
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,592
I know you're frustrated.
Let's step back and take a deep breath.

411
00:29:18,593 --> 00:29:20,636
That didn't work when I was five.
It still doesn't.

412
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:23,222
[exhales heavily]
There's gotta be something we can do.

413
00:29:23,223 --> 00:29:24,805
Can we... Can we... Can we give her coffee?

414
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:27,267
Can we... Can we put her underneath
a cold shower? Anything?

415
00:29:27,268 --> 00:29:29,019
[Pete] She's not a machine
we can switch on and off.

416
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,771
So that's it? You won't even try?

417
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:32,648
[breathes heavily]

418
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,817
I could try giving her something
to reverse the sedation.

419
00:29:35,818 --> 00:29:36,943
Why didn't you say that before?

420
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:38,946
- 'Cause it doesn't always work.
- [Juliette] Okay.

421
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:41,448
[breathing shakily]
There can be side effects.

422
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:47,496
They are doing this to her,
and I need to find out why.

423
00:29:47,497 --> 00:29:49,831
So, please.

424
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:53,627
Okay. I'll get some things.

425
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:20,153
Gloria, can you hear me?

426
00:30:21,822 --> 00:30:24,408
- [Gloria breathing heavily]
- [Juliette] Wha...

427
00:30:24,409 --> 00:30:26,451
- [Gloria grunts]
- What's wrong?

428
00:30:26,452 --> 00:30:27,660
This is what I was afraid of.

429
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:29,788
- What's happening to her?
- Shit! She's having a seizure.

430
00:30:29,789 --> 00:30:31,164
[Gloria groans]

431
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,293
[Pete] Jules, I need your help.

432
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:38,004
[Gloria groaning]

433
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:42,092
- It's okay. You know what to do.
- Okay. Okay.

434
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:43,926
[Gloria groaning]

435
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:46,555
One one thousand. Two one thousand.

Four one thousand. Five one thousand.

Six one thousand. Seven one thousand.

439
00:30:52,905 --> 00:30:55,063
Eight one thousand. Nine one thousand.

440
00:30:55,064 --> 00:30:56,189
Ten.

441
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,400
- Eleven. Twelve.
- [Gloria whimpering]

[Gloria gasping, groaning]

443
00:31:03,197 --> 00:31:04,948
[Gloria hyperventilates, groans]

444
00:31:04,949 --> 00:31:06,032
It's abating.

445
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:09,285
[breathing heavily] Is she okay?

446
00:31:09,286 --> 00:31:11,872
[Gloria gasping, breathing shallowly]

447
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:12,956
[Pete] Are you?

448
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:17,836
Yeah. Yeah... [sniffs]
...Yeah. I'm fine.

449
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,090
[Pete sighs]

450
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,635
[Gloria breathing shallowly]

451
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:26,929
[Pete] We shouldn't wake her.

452
00:31:27,888 --> 00:31:29,765
It'll have to wait.

453
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:31,725
[Juliette sighs]

454
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,024
- [door unlocking]
- [hinges creaking]

- [keypad beeping]
- [electronic tone]

458
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:06,509
[Diego] We lost the sheriff.
She was last seen heading into Medical.

459
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,263
We figured she was coming back for
the old woman, but she went the other way.

460
00:32:09,264 --> 00:32:11,097
Must have gone someplace
where there's a camera down.

461
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:14,017
- Ah, she wouldn't know that.
- Maybe she lucked into a blind spot.

462
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:17,062
Where are the blind spots on Medical?

463
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:20,127
We've been repurposing cameras
from down there for years.

464
00:32:20,128 --> 00:32:22,619
The last few we took
went to replace the busted ones on 52.

465
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,888
Look, we try and keep
the main areas of Medical covered but...

466
00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:29,157
But none of you have any idea
where she could be? None of you?

467
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:34,037
Then get a map and start checking
every single room for what we're missing.

468
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:42,211
What?

469
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:44,047
That badge looks good on you.

470
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:47,550
My daughter, the sheriff.

471
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:49,678
Yeah, well, it's not for long, so...

472
00:32:50,721 --> 00:32:52,264
What's this about, Jules?

473
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:54,433
Why would I tell you?

474
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,479
[sighs] I need a coffee.

475
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:03,317
- You want a cup?
- [Juliette] Nope. Thanks.

476
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:05,736
[door opens]

477
00:33:07,321 --> 00:33:08,322
[door closes]

478
00:33:10,991 --> 00:33:12,826
Oh, where am I?

479
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:15,495
Gloria?

480
00:33:17,915 --> 00:33:19,625
You're... You're in the nursery.

481
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:22,043
Oh, why?

482
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:22,960
I'm the sheriff.

483
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:26,256
I... I've... I brought you here 'cause
I need to ask you some questions.

484
00:33:26,257 --> 00:33:28,717
You're not... You're not the sheriff.
He's...

485
00:33:28,718 --> 00:33:30,593
That was Holston. Holston Becker.

486
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:34,639
He went out three years
after his wife Allison went out to clean.

487
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,935
- [Gloria breathing shakily]
- And you spoke to her about her fertility.

488
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,562
- Oh.
- Look, I know this is a lot to remember,

489
00:33:40,563 --> 00:33:41,917
but I really need you to try.

490
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:43,272
Did... Did the two of you

491
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:44,942
- talk about anything else?
- [door opens]

492
00:33:44,943 --> 00:33:46,192
[Pete] How is she?

493
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:49,488
She's... She's still out of it.
I... I'm running out of time. And...

494
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:53,032
- [sighs] Oh. [breathes shakily]
- Gloria. Gloria.

495
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:56,161
I'm Dr. Nichols.
I'm just gonna listen to your heart. Okay?

496
00:33:56,162 --> 00:33:59,122
Nichols... [breathes deeply]...Nichols.

497
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:04,086
I know you. I know you.

498
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,256
- What do you want from me?
- It's okay. It's okay. He's my dad.

499
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:09,215
- He's just trying to help...
- He works for them.

500
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,977
- [Juliette] What is she talking about?
- [Gloria panting] It was him.

501
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:15,012
- He was my doctor.
- What is she talking about?

502
00:34:15,013 --> 00:34:18,350
- Was... Was she one of your patients?
- [Gloria] You. It was you.

503
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:20,373
- Answer me, were you?
- [Gloria] You. It was him.

504
00:34:20,374 --> 00:34:22,395
I don't... [stammers]
It would have been 40 years ago.

505
00:34:22,396 --> 00:34:25,065
- He stopped me from having a baby.
- What? Is that... Is this true?

506
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:26,649
- [Gloria] It was you!
- Jules, I, uh...

507
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,402
- [Gloria] Making it all come back.
- [Juliette] No. You're upsetting her.

508
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:30,903
I'm not the one
who's put her through this.

509
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:32,906
- Go. Get out of here. Get out.
- [Gloria] No. Not again.

510
00:34:32,907 --> 00:34:35,116
- Hey, Gloria. Look at me. Look at me.
- No! No.

511
00:34:35,117 --> 00:34:38,161
- It's okay. He's gone. He's gone.
- [door opens, closes]

512
00:34:38,162 --> 00:34:39,912
Hey, what did you mean,
he worked for them?

513
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:41,915
- What do you mean...
- [stammers] I don't want to be here.

514
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:43,582
- It's okay.
- [sobs]

515
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:47,169
Listen to me. They are doing this to you.

516
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,630
They're drugging you
so that you will forget.

517
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,092
I wanna forget.
I want to be anywhere but here.

518
00:34:52,093 --> 00:34:54,303
I don't trust you. [breathes shakily]

519
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:55,720
[Juliette sighs]

520
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:58,473
Oh. [breathing shakily]

521
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:04,771
{\an8}- [gasps]
- You've seen this before, haven't you?

522
00:35:04,772 --> 00:35:07,691
Oh. Oh. [sighs] Oh, my.

523
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,654
- Where did you get this?
- It belonged to someone I knew. George.

524
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:14,281
I was told he got it from you.

525
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:15,448
Little George?

526
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,909
He's not the one I gave it to.
I gave it to his mother.

527
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:20,891
- [stammers] I can't remember her name.
- It's okay. It's okay.

528
00:35:20,892 --> 00:35:23,874
- She... She was one of us.
- What do you mean "one of us"?

529
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:26,125
[Gloria breathing heavily]

530
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:30,130
I don't know you,
and I don't know what you want.

531
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:38,180
Have you heard of the Flamekeepers?

532
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,016
No.

533
00:35:41,683 --> 00:35:43,935
That's because they erased us.

534
00:35:43,936 --> 00:35:46,187
- [Juliette] Who did?
- The Silo.

535
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:47,647
They've been trying since the rebellion.

536
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:50,275
That's when they put something
in the water so memories would fade.

537
00:35:50,276 --> 00:35:51,275
What?

538
00:35:51,276 --> 00:35:55,948
They wanted to erase the past
and anyone who tried to preserve it.

539
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:59,367
I don't understand.
Who were the Flamekeepers?

540
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:03,872
The people who fought back,
who kept things, like this book.

541
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:05,831
To keep their memories alive.

542
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:08,501
- Are you one of them?
- Yes, I was.

543
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:11,171
U... Until they put our flame out.

544
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:17,510
You said my dad stopped you
from having a baby.

545
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:20,763
- They wanted us to die off.
- [Juliette, softly] What?

546
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:25,310
They made us think we had a chance
of having a family, but we never did.

547
00:36:25,311 --> 00:36:28,856
Wait. And the doctors knew about this?

548
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:30,731
[Gloria] They had to.

549
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:33,694
They said they were taking out
our birth control.

550
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:35,571
But it was a lie.

551
00:36:36,738 --> 00:36:38,656
I figured it out...

552
00:36:38,657 --> 00:36:41,034
- [Juliette gasps]
- ...after we failed our second lottery.

553
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:43,662
Henry, my husband,
he wasn't a Flamekeeper,

554
00:36:43,663 --> 00:36:45,496
and he wanted children so badly.

555
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:47,123
And I knew he'd never
have a chance with me

556
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:51,712
and he'd never go if I told him
the truth. So, I pushed him away.

557
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:57,301
I ran into him once
when he was with his children,

558
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,887
and he pretended not to know me.

559
00:37:02,347 --> 00:37:06,560
Seeing what they took from us,
I couldn't do it anymore.

560
00:37:06,561 --> 00:37:10,334
So, I gave my most treasured relic

561
00:37:10,335 --> 00:37:14,109
to the last Flamekeeper I knew.

562
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:17,028
And that was George's mom?

563
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:20,032
Yeah. Her name, it was Anne.
She died not long after that.

564
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:23,243
Her poor little boy had no one.

565
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:28,247
When was the last time you saw him?

566
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:32,503
Did... Did he say... Did he say
anything to you about a hard drive?

567
00:37:32,504 --> 00:37:34,505
Oh, I kept tabs on George
when he was growing up,

568
00:37:34,506 --> 00:37:37,174
but I...
I lost track of him over the years.

569
00:37:37,175 --> 00:37:38,258
How is he?

570
00:37:42,763 --> 00:37:44,056
When?

571
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:46,974
Last year.

572
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:53,975
He, um... He fell off the stairs,
and it wasn't an accident.

573
00:37:55,442 --> 00:37:57,611
This place, it's...

574
00:37:59,988 --> 00:38:03,825
They may be keeping me drugged,
but at least I can escape.

575
00:38:03,826 --> 00:38:05,244
Look at this.

576
00:38:05,827 --> 00:38:06,828
Let me find it.

577
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:11,124
The water.

578
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,254
They called it the ocean.

579
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,800
I've pictured myself there so many times,

580
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,931
but I'll never know what it sounded like
and how it smelled.

581
00:38:26,932 --> 00:38:28,433
[baby babbles]

582
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:31,603
Can I hold it?

583
00:38:31,604 --> 00:38:33,229
[baby fussing]

584
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,314
[softly] Yeah, sure.

585
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,239
- [Gloria exhales deeply]
- [baby babbling]

586
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:51,123
Oh. Hello.

587
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:53,041
Hello.

588
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:57,671
Hello.

589
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:05,429
You're Hanna Nichols's daughter.

590
00:39:07,431 --> 00:39:08,974
Yeah. Did you know her?

591
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:13,562
I remember hearing about her from Anne.

592
00:39:14,313 --> 00:39:16,022
George's mom knew my mom?

593
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:19,109
Well, she was helping your mother
with something.

594
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:23,572
I... I can't remember what.
It was some kind of magnifying device.

595
00:39:24,072 --> 00:39:26,282
Do you know, I was always really surprised

596
00:39:26,283 --> 00:39:30,287
that they let a woman like Hanna Nichols
have children.

597
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,457
Was my mom a Flamekeeper?

598
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:37,544
She shared the same curiosity.

599
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:43,008
It's the one thing
that they can never breed out of us.

600
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:49,806
When I heard what had happened to her...

601
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,561
it really felt like
we'd lost one of our own.

602
00:40:11,245 --> 00:40:12,246
[door opens]

603
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:17,251
- How is she?
- I'm taking her back.

604
00:40:17,876 --> 00:40:19,670
Well, it's not safe for you, Jules.

605
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:21,421
[Juliette sighs]

606
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:25,259
You are the last person
I would ever trust to tell me what's safe.

607
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,717
I would never put you in danger.

608
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:29,346
But you would trick your patients
into believing

609
00:40:29,347 --> 00:40:31,682
their birth control has been removed?

610
00:40:34,101 --> 00:40:35,768
I didn't have a choice.

611
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,854
If I wanted to do this work
to help people and...

612
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:42,860
Help? The only ones you're helping
are the ones trying to breed people out.

613
00:40:42,861 --> 00:40:46,321
You have to understand.
They never told me anything about that.

614
00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:47,697
When they came to me,

615
00:40:47,698 --> 00:40:50,346
they said this was necessary
for long-term survival

616
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,995
to prevent genetic disease
from running rampant.

617
00:40:52,996 --> 00:40:55,289
But why lie to people?

618
00:40:57,749 --> 00:40:59,543
Why give them false hope?

619
00:41:00,544 --> 00:41:03,380
Did you ever think to question that?

620
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:06,925
Of course I did.

621
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:13,182
I always wondered if somehow they
wanted to punish the ones they picked.

622
00:41:14,683 --> 00:41:17,603
And yet, you just went along
with whatever they said?

623
00:41:17,604 --> 00:41:21,064
There are consequences
to asking questions.

624
00:41:21,065 --> 00:41:22,419
We both know that.

625
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,775
[Juliette sighs]

626
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:27,196
- I know you think I betrayed Mom.
- No, don't.

627
00:41:29,489 --> 00:41:30,657
[scoffs]

628
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:33,994
Clearly she wasn't the only one
that you betrayed.

629
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:46,214
Shit, I got her.

630
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:50,009
[night nurse] Hey. Hey!
What's going on? Is she okay?

631
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,055
[Juliette] One of my deputies found her
wandering around the stairs, so...

632
00:41:53,056 --> 00:41:55,431
You said she didn't go back
to Hildebrandt.

633
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:58,497
- She... She didn't.
- Then how the hell do you explain that?

634
00:41:58,498 --> 00:42:01,563
- I don't know.
- Find out where they just came from. Now!

635
00:42:01,564 --> 00:42:02,939
And stay on them!

636
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,398
[night nurse] Sheriff, I can assure you...

637
00:42:04,399 --> 00:42:06,735
<i>I'm going to escort her
back to her room and file a report.</i>

638
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:08,945
[door opens]

639
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:13,825
Oh, wait. I wanna walk.

640
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:15,910
Okay.

641
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:17,162
[Gloria sighs]

642
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:22,334
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

643
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:24,837
[breathes shakily]

644
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:31,260
[door closes]

645
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,596
- Um...
- [Gloria breathing deeply]

646
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:37,057
Can I see it one more time?

647
00:42:37,975 --> 00:42:38,976
[softly] Sure.

648
00:42:45,232 --> 00:42:46,233
[sighing] Oh.

649
00:42:52,614 --> 00:42:55,325
- [Gloria] You keep it safe.
- Yeah, I will.

650
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:03,834
My flowers, they're gone.

651
00:43:05,544 --> 00:43:09,131
I remember now. Sheriff Holston was here.

652
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,259
- When?
- I... I don't... I don't know.

653
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:14,094
Not long ago. I lose track.

654
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:18,932
He brought flowers,
and he put them right there.

655
00:43:18,933 --> 00:43:21,310
- In front of the mirror?
- Yes.

656
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:42,706
{\an8}- [Juliette] Never seen this one before.
- Maybe it's what he wanted you to see?

657
00:43:43,707 --> 00:43:45,459
[Juliette] No idea what it is.

658
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:01,975
[whispers] I think they can see us
through the mirror.

659
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:04,540
- That's why Holston put flowers there.
- [whispers] What?

660
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:07,105
[whispers] They've got these devices
like the sensors outside,

661
00:44:07,106 --> 00:44:09,274
and I think they're watching us.

662
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:12,152
[Gloria exhales deeply]

663
00:44:12,694 --> 00:44:16,490
[whispers] Do you remember anything else
when he was here? Anything he said?

664
00:44:16,491 --> 00:44:19,159
[Gloria whispers] No, no.
He... He wasn't here for very long.

665
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,787
And he spent most of his time
working on that vent.

666
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,722
- She's blocked our view.
- [Sims shushes]

667
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:55,445
What is she doing?

668
00:44:56,071 --> 00:44:58,448
- The problem is we only have audio.
- No, Diego.

669
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:01,326
The problem is
she knows there are cameras.

670
00:45:01,327 --> 00:45:03,453
[Gloria] What is it? What did you find?

671
00:45:03,454 --> 00:45:06,498
Send the raiders. Now!

672
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:09,042
[Juliette sighs]

673
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:14,715
Oh.

674
00:45:19,428 --> 00:45:21,348
[whispers] I can't stay.
They're gonna be coming.

675
00:45:25,184 --> 00:45:27,894
- You're the last Flamekeeper now.
- No.

676
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:32,065
You didn't ask for it. It's not fair.
But it's the way it is. It's down to you.

677
00:45:32,066 --> 00:45:34,902
- No.
- If you let it die, the truth dies too.

678
00:45:34,903 --> 00:45:36,068
I have to go.

679
00:45:36,069 --> 00:45:38,071
What would your mother want you to do?

680
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:42,951
- I wish I could ask her, but I can't.
- No, you can't.

681
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:45,829
But do you know why she killed herself?

682
00:46:04,389 --> 00:46:05,390
Where is she?
