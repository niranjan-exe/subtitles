1
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:12,554
[Juliette] Where are we going?

2
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,226
Not much further, Bean. Okay.

3
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,274
[Mosley] You said you'd be on time.

4
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,026
And alone.

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,946
[Hanna] My daughter can keep a secret.

6
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,073
Unless you'd rather I find another
taker for these.

7
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,539
[Mosley sighs]

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,670
You get caught,
I'm gonna say you found it.

9
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,379
No one's getting caught.

10
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,842
Don't be so sure. The Silo always wins.

11
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,026
- I can carry it.
- [sighs]

12
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,612
[breathes deeply] Okay.

13
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,657
- You got me a rabbit?
- [Hanna shushes]

14
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,993
It's not a pet, okay?

15
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:21,957
- We're not gonna eat it.
- [chuckles] No, we're not gonna eat it.

16
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,961
It's barely moving. I think it's sick.

17
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,463
That's the point, Bean.

18
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,926
[baby fussing]

19
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,442
[baby crying]

20
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:52,696
We're not looking for a baby.

21
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,951
[footsteps departing]

22
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,750
[Gloria] Please.

23
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,501
Won't be much longer.

24
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,170
Come on, I need to sleep.

25
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,379
I know.

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,049
I can't stay in here.

27
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:14,510
Miss Hildebrandt.

28
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:18,180
[Gloria breathing heavily]

29
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:32,444
[Sims] You weren't very cooperative
with my agents.

30
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:44,248
I hope you'll be more cooperative
with me, Gloria.

31
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:50,003
You're the security man.

32
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,090
Your wife had a miscarriage.

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,842
Your memory is sharp.

34
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,552
That bodes well for us.

35
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:02,140
You two were about to give up on a family,
but you still had time on your lottery.

36
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,893
And then I got you s-some f... [sighs]

37
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:07,645
- Folic acid.
- Folic acid. That's it.

38
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:10,274
One drop in her tea every night.
Did it work?

39
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,609
Our boy turns six next month.

40
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,194
Oh.

41
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,365
I need your help.

42
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,160
If you cooperate
and give me what I'm looking for,

43
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,874
I'll personally guarantee
you're never kept from your dreams again.

44
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,626
If I don't help you?

45
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,380
You gonna send an old woman out to clean?

46
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,007
No.

47
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,550
I'll leave her in this room unmedicated

48
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:41,305
to spend the rest of her days
staring at these walls.

49
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:44,641
Why should I trust you?

50
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,562
Because thanks to you, I have my son.

51
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,359
I take no pleasure
in putting you in this position.

52
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,947
But now the situation
is of grave importance to the Silo.

53
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:03,076
Juliette Nichols paid you a visit.

54
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,245
Took something out of that vent.

55
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,957
I need to know what that was.

56
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,627
[sighs]

57
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:13,337
A bag.

58
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,173
Did Sheriff Holston hide it in there?

59
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,718
[sighs] Yes.

60
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,137
What was inside the bag?

61
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,622
Give her the good stuff.
Every dose, every day.

62
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,458
Anyone try to pull her out,
they go through me.

63
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,043
Yes, sir.

64
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,633
Thank you, Miss Hildebrandt.

65
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:01,927
For everything.

66
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,807
Do you really think you'll win?

67
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,184
[Sims sighs]

68
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,271
We have to.

69
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,846
Cameras had her on the stairs
below here going down,

70
00:07:08,847 --> 00:07:11,181
but then we lost her. [sighs]

71
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,183
Stair coverage gets pretty spotty
below Medical.

72
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,396
When you find her, secure her.
She has a red-level relic with her.

73
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:19,273
Tell your team nobody touches it.

74
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:20,357
[agent] Yes, sir.

75
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,670
[sighs]

76
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,090
[typing]

77
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,010
[beeps]

78
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,309
[sighs]

79
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,275
[inhales sharply]

80
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,197
[switch clicks]

81
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,413
What's gonna happen?

82
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,250
[Hanna] Well, I think there could be
a small hole in his heart.

83
00:08:20,251 --> 00:08:21,835
- Like Jacob had?
- Yeah.

84
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,547
And, uh, I'm gonna find it and sew it up.

85
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:28,175
- How are you gonna see it?
- With this.

86
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,929
All right, bring him over.

87
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,737
Now, this next part's gonna be scary.

88
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:52,241
- Are you sure you want to stay?
- Yeah, I wanna watch it all.

89
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:53,825
[chuckles] Okay, then.

90
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,838
You wanna see his heart?

91
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,048
Come on, then.

92
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,346
- [heartbeat thumping]
- [Juliette] Whoa, it's gigantic.

93
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:16,849
My darling Bean, this is a magnifier.

94
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:21,644
It's the first one in the Silo.
It makes tiny things appear big.

95
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:25,816
Now, if this works... [sighs]
...we can use it to help other people.

96
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,823
Okay.

97
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,202
- [radio static]
- [Paul] <i>Billings to Sheriff.</i>

98
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,374
- [radio static]
- [Paul] <i>Billings to Sheriff.</i>

99
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,254
- What is it, Billings?
- [radio static]

100
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,965
[Paul] <i>You need to come to the office.</i>

101
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,016
[objects scraping, thudding]

102
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,019
[papers rustling]

103
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,355
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

104
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,484
- You need to wait here until we finish.
- No, no, no. This is our office.

105
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,402
How can they do this?

106
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,448
Meadows ordered a search
for unregistered relics.

107
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:15,532
What?

108
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,659
Sounds like a load of rat shit to me.

109
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,620
The real question is why she did it.

110
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,580
Why are you looking at me? I don't know.

111
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:25,208
Sims took the last relic.
I don't think anything's come in since.

112
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:27,857
Uh-huh. What happened at your little visit
with her yesterday?

113
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:30,506
Nothing happened. I brought her eggs
and bacon like you said.

114
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:31,924
- She's sick as a dog.
- [clatters]

115
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,176
Hey! Take it easy, Howey.

116
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:38,137
You realize this is a blatant violation
of the Pact, right?

117
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:42,976
Law enforcement premises cannot be
searched without extreme probable cause.

118
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,145
Do you hear what I'm saying?

119
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,273
[objects rustling, clattering]

120
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,079
Make sure you check under the flooring.

121
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,630
[Hanna] Do you know how lost I felt?

122
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,632
This was the one thing that I could do.

123
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:18,554
Imagine if we'd had something
like this for Jacob, hmm?

124
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:20,973
We... I mean, we could... [stammers]

125
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:25,477
All I... All I want
is to stop other families

126
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,103
from going through the same thing.

127
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,730
You don't think I felt lost too?

128
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:32,025
But that doesn't mean you can start
making unsanctioned devices.

129
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:34,069
That device could help fix heart defects.

130
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,778
- [sighs]
- It could save lives.

131
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,365
Why is a magnifier even illegal
in the first place?

132
00:11:38,366 --> 00:11:40,116
I don't know, but there are rules.

133
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,118
You're good at following rules.
I'll give you that.

134
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:44,538
- What's that supposed to mean?
- No one else knew what I was doing

135
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:45,663
besides you and Jules.

136
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,748
What, you think I told Judicial?

137
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:51,003
I'm sure there's something in the Pact
about reporting your family.

138
00:11:51,004 --> 00:11:53,005
[sighs] How can you even suggest that?
[inhales shakily]

139
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:54,839
How else could they have known?

140
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,968
[Pete] Because there are
fucking whisperers everywhere!

141
00:11:58,719 --> 00:11:59,969
You haven't exactly been subtle.

142
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,888
Glass and metal deliveries to our door,

143
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,765
taking our daughter to the farm
after hours.

144
00:12:03,766 --> 00:12:05,704
- [objects clattering]
- Oh. Oh, please.

145
00:12:05,705 --> 00:12:07,644
Please, Hanna.
Just give them what they want

146
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:09,812
before they tear down our entire home.

147
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,608
[inhales shakily]
Juliette's room is... Please.

148
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,737
I hope whatever you're getting out
of this is worth it.

149
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,450
- [clattering continues]
- Stop.

150
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,161
I'll give it to you.

151
00:12:25,454 --> 00:12:26,455
Stand down.

152
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,061
What is all this?

153
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:21,385
[snaps fingers]

154
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,180
No!

155
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,607
Now the animal.

156
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,026
Tell us where it is,

157
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,280
and we'll drop the charges
against the farmer.

158
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:43,949
It died.

159
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,035
We ate the meat, composted the rest.

160
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:54,710
The Judicial Department thanks you
for your time and your cooperation.

161
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,684
I swear to you, I didn't.

162
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:20,235
[mutters] It's okay. I've got this.

163
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,271
[clatters]

164
00:14:58,649 --> 00:14:59,983
[lid slams shut]

165
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,529
- We need to check that.
- That's not gonna happen.

166
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,160
Little help here?

167
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,330
Are you fucking kidding me?

168
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:14,831
Fine.

169
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:25,968
There. You happy, asshole?

170
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,221
[objects clattering]

171
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:39,273
[agent] Let's go.

172
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,116
And you used to work with these people?

173
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:53,495
{\an8}I was in administration, not one
of these overcompensating fuckwads.

174
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,373
- What? I cuss.
- [scoffs]

175
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,710
Either way, this doesn't feel
like a regular toss and turn.

176
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:01,378
- This feels...
- No, this is personal.

177
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:03,589
[sighing] Fuck.

178
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,633
Meadows didn't do this.
She's not behind this.

179
00:16:07,176 --> 00:16:09,386
- She signed the warrant.
- No, when I was there,

180
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,180
something didn't feel right.

181
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,308
I don't think she's the one
calling the shots.

182
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:17,436
- Then who is?
- Sims.

183
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,312
- Robert?
- Yeah.

184
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:21,355
He enforces the Pact.
He's not some power-hungry...

185
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:24,026
No. No, he's wanted to get rid of me
ever since I arrived.

186
00:16:24,027 --> 00:16:26,694
This here, this is just a warm-up.

187
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,865
He's not gonna stop until I'm either
in that cell or over the fucking rail.

188
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,993
[sighing] Fuck.

189
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:36,330
You said this was an illegal search
and seizure, right?

190
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:40,666
They skipped about ten steps.

191
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,170
There should have been an initial notice,
a request for evidence...

192
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:45,506
- You're coming with me to Judicial.
- To do what?

193
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:49,843
[Sims]
Does this look like a hard drive to you?

194
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,013
No, sir.

195
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:54,932
How about this?

196
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,559
- Does it plug into a computer?
- No, sir.

197
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,314
Did the warrant say to bring back
useless fucking office supplies?

198
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:04,065
That's all we found in her office.

199
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,817
Then you didn't look hard enough!

200
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,069
New plan.

201
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,073
I want you to find every porter
who worked between level one and 50.

202
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:16,578
Find out if she handed off anything
or talked to anyone. That's what...

203
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,413
[assistant stammers] I'm sorry.
I tried to stop them.

204
00:17:18,414 --> 00:17:20,206
Miss Nichols,
you can't just barge into my...

205
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,834
- Robert Sims, you're under arrest.
- ...office like this.

206
00:17:21,835 --> 00:17:23,668
[Sims] Wait, this is about your office.

207
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,899
- I told Meadows you'd be pissed...
- [Juliette] Fuck Meadows.

208
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,131
You're under arrest
for breaking Pact investigation protocol.

209
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:30,592
- What, are we making up crimes now?
- Deputy Billings.

210
00:17:30,593 --> 00:17:33,052
Section 14, subsection three,
paragraph 12B.

211
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:37,015
- And illegal search and seizure.
- Section 23, subsection 19, paragraph six.

212
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:39,893
All those Pact Bees you won
while you were a kid

213
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,396
finally paid off, huh, Paul?

214
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,230
Seems that way.

215
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,774
Miss Nichols, I had nothing
to do with that search order.

216
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,319
Your agents broke protocol,
and I'm holding you responsible.

217
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,405
You don't like it,
you can take it up with Meadows.

218
00:17:51,406 --> 00:17:53,490
Cuff him and take him upstairs. [sniffs]

219
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,078
Are you sure you want to do this?

220
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,914
Want's got nothing to do with it.
She's the boss.

221
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:04,960
For the moment.

222
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,345
Take all this back upstairs
and put it where you found it.

223
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:17,263
- [Sims grunts]
- Hey!

224
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:19,766
Do you wanna join your boss in jail?
I've got more cuffs.

225
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,770
- You'll regret this.
- I doubt that.

226
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,529
Great. Place better look like you
were never there.

227
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,544
[breathes deeply]

228
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:53,110
[gasps]

229
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,208
Jules?

230
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,210
Is everything okay?

231
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:14,214
[stammers] Why didn't you want mom
to build a magnifier?

232
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,716
[Pete sighs]

233
00:20:16,717 --> 00:20:19,511
Look, I... I know you
have very strong feelings about...

234
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:21,721
No, I...
I wanna know why she killed herself.

235
00:20:21,722 --> 00:20:24,308
I know I wasn't willing to listen before.
I am now.

236
00:20:24,309 --> 00:20:26,852
I, um... I really need to know.

237
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:41,700
Wasn't about the magnifier.

238
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,368
What do you mean?

239
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:47,246
A couple of times a year,

240
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:49,999
I have to break the news
to a young, happy couple

241
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,753
that their newborn has died.
[breathes shakily]

242
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:54,505
It's my job.

243
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:56,840
But it's not the hardest part.

244
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,844
The hardest is running into that father
and mother in the years after

245
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,513
and seeing what it's done to them.

246
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,098
Loss affects people differently.

247
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:11,438
Sometimes it shrinks your world,
draws you inward. [inhales shakily]

248
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:14,358
And that's how it was for me
after we lost your brother.

249
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,068
I spent a lot more time in here

250
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:19,655
when I should have been there
for you and your mother.

251
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:23,033
I'll always regret that.

252
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,118
And I'm sorry.

253
00:21:31,667 --> 00:21:33,210
But your mother...

254
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,715
grief turned her outward,
pushed her toward dangerous things.

255
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,300
She so desperately wanted answers,

256
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,054
she stopped caring about the lines
she had to cross to get them.

257
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:45,722
[softly] But she still wanted
to help people.

258
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:47,891
And I wanted to help her, protect her.

259
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:49,225
That's all I cared about.

260
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:51,645
Not the magnifier. Not anything else.

261
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,858
[softly] But it wasn't enough.

262
00:21:58,318 --> 00:21:59,570
I should have stopped them...

263
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,362
[breathing shakily]

264
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:04,992
...Judicial, when they came into our home.

265
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:10,289
I should have done something
besides bowing to their will.

266
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:18,630
When those agents crushed her machine,
they crushed her spirit.

267
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:26,430
And I tried to bring her back,
but she didn't wanna listen to me.

268
00:22:27,181 --> 00:22:28,557
I gave up.

269
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,395
I failed her.

270
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,318
That's why I left you in Mechanical.

271
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,865
You're like your mom
in so many ways, Jules.

272
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:49,119
[sobs]
When you went down there, it wrecked me.

273
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,706
But I knew it was for the best,
even if it meant you'd hate me.

274
00:22:52,707 --> 00:22:54,332
I knew that down there,

275
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:59,129
you could put your talent
into fixing real things in front of you

276
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,341
instead of chasing impossible answers
like your mother did.

277
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:06,136
And yet here I am. [sniffles]

278
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:08,514
Here you are.

279
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:13,018
And she blamed you, you know? [sniffles]

280
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:17,042
She thought you had reported her.
I did too.

281
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:19,618
I know. And I swear to you, I never. Ever.

282
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:22,194
No, I know. I know. [breathes shakily]

283
00:23:22,778 --> 00:23:27,032
Judicial, they were watching Mom
with sensors through the mirrors.

284
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:28,491
I found her file.

285
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,410
- What do you mean?
- They... They have their own cameras.

286
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:34,122
That's... And they listen,
not just with porters and other people,

287
00:23:34,123 --> 00:23:35,206
they have devices.

288
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:37,793
- That's how they knew about the magnifier.
- [gasps] Oh.

289
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:40,754
- That's how they know everything.
- [sighs]

290
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:44,424
She never believed me.

291
00:23:44,425 --> 00:23:46,093
I know. I know.

292
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:47,802
I do.

293
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:50,764
[breathes deeply, crying] Oh, Juliette.

294
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:59,981
[softly] I know. I'm so sorry. [sniffles]

295
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:03,402
[breathes shakily, crying]
I still miss her so much.

296
00:24:03,403 --> 00:24:04,486
[Juliette] I do too.

297
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:06,904
[Juliette sniffling]

298
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,493
- [Alice] Sorry to interrupt.
- It's okay.

299
00:24:11,494 --> 00:24:13,662
Maintenance is here. [sighs]

300
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:18,125
- What for?
- Something about checking the vents.

301
00:24:18,126 --> 00:24:19,793
He's very insistent.

302
00:24:21,712 --> 00:24:24,673
- Did you send for a work order?
- No.

303
00:24:24,674 --> 00:24:26,008
- Did you?
- No.

304
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:29,303
Can you tell him to come back later?

305
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,054
[Pete] Please.

306
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:32,139
Okay.

307
00:24:35,184 --> 00:24:37,686
When we brought Gloria here, you said
you thought there were no listeners.

308
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:39,854
- Uh-huh.
- There are no cameras.

309
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,655
This maintenance guy,
he's here to put one in.

310
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,776
Right now, this is a dead spot for them.

311
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:47,841
- What's that?
- A hard drive.

312
00:24:47,842 --> 00:24:49,405
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

313
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:52,159
I... I tried using your computer
to find out, but I couldn't open it.

314
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,660
It requires some authorization. [sniffs]

315
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,706
I'm gonna take it to Walk.
If anyone can get around it, she can.

316
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,438
Could you just, um...
Could you let her know I'll be coming?

317
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:04,254
I should... [sniffles]
...I should be able to be there by 6:00.

318
00:25:04,255 --> 00:25:08,342
Yeah. Jules, you be... you be safe. Please.

319
00:25:08,343 --> 00:25:09,635
[whispers] Yeah, I will.

320
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,018
Okay. [sniffles]

321
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:26,860
[door closes]

322
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:33,408
- [citizens chattering]
- [checkpoint agent] ID. Next. ID.

323
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:34,867
[citizen] Come on.

324
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:37,849
- [checkpoint agent] ID. Bag check.
- Shit.

325
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,832
- What's going on?
- I should be asking you.

326
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,085
Can't you get them to speed this up?

327
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:46,213
If I'm late for my next job,
I'm late for every one after.

328
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:47,714
Yeah, sure, I'll look into it.

329
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,308
Hey, Jerry.

330
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,442
- Yes, sir?
- Could I trouble you for a cup of coffee?

331
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:24,501
[Sims] Black. No sugar, no cream.

332
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:28,755
[softly] Right.

333
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:31,049
[liquid pours]

334
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:36,972
[sighs]

335
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:43,937
Thanks.

336
00:26:45,147 --> 00:26:47,733
Also, could you do me a favor?

337
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:50,319
Let me use your radio a second.

338
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:58,138
- Mr. Sims, sir... I... I just...
- Just one call.

339
00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:00,913
I... I just...
I really think we need to wait,

340
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,915
you know, until someone gets back.

341
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,293
[sighs] I-If that's all right.

342
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:12,049
Sheriff? Or Billings?

343
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,800
Mm-hmm.

344
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,888
Yeah, you're right. I understand.

345
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:19,556
Don't worry about it.

346
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,142
I won't hold it against you.

347
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,330
Hey, you.

348
00:27:44,748 --> 00:27:47,709
- I missed her again, didn't I?
- I just put her down.

349
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:49,837
Busy day?

350
00:27:50,671 --> 00:27:53,757
You have no idea. [breathes deeply]

351
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,511
Dinner's almost ready.

352
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:01,557
[Paul sighs]

353
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:07,938
[sighs]

354
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:09,605
[plates shattering]

355
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,024
- [groans]
- Are you okay?

356
00:28:11,025 --> 00:28:12,358
[sighs]

357
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,527
[straining] Mm-hmm.

358
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:15,904
[exhales]

359
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:19,825
- Sorry, I just...
- Don't be. I'll get it later.

360
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:22,119
The tremors have gotten worse
since you went upstairs.

361
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,245
I'm fine.

362
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:25,789
- This job is...
- It's not the job.

363
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:28,709
I like the job. I just... [sighs]

364
00:28:30,294 --> 00:28:34,006
She put me in a position today where I had
to choose between her and Sims.

365
00:28:34,007 --> 00:28:36,800
- How is that even a choice?
- It's complicated.

366
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:38,384
[Paul sighs]

367
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:41,430
[scoffs] People are saying she's laying
the groundwork for another rebellion.

368
00:28:41,431 --> 00:28:44,015
- Where'd you hear that?
- Everyone's on edge.

369
00:28:44,016 --> 00:28:46,768
Everything that's been happening,
all these deaths in a week.

370
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:48,520
- It's not normal.
- If you're worried about me...

371
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:51,856
I am.
Clearly, the stress is making it worse.

372
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:55,944
Honey... [chuckling] ...I'll be fine.
I promise you.

373
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,071
[Paul sighs]

374
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,273
[breathing deeply]

375
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:37,528
[exhales]

376
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,117
[breathing shakily]

377
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:49,748
Hello?

378
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:54,294
Hello? Is anyone around?

379
00:29:55,504 --> 00:29:56,922
[sighs]

380
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,517
Hello? [breathing heavily]

381
00:30:16,984 --> 00:30:19,319
Son of a bitch. [inhales deeply]

382
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,155
[footsteps approaching]

383
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:23,740
- Hello?
- [Shirley] Walk?

384
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:26,534
What's going on?

385
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:29,246
- Have you seen Jules?
- Should I have?

386
00:30:29,913 --> 00:30:31,664
She was supposed to be here an hour ago.

387
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:34,418
- Can you let me know if you see her?
- Will do.

388
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:35,502
[sighs]

389
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:49,308
- [dishware clattering]
- [workers chattering]

390
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,026
Lukas Kyle?

391
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:00,694
Yes.

392
00:31:01,195 --> 00:31:02,279
For you.

393
00:31:17,252 --> 00:31:18,253
You see it?

394
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:20,881
[Juliette] I see a "W."

395
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,541
Hi. Get in.

396
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,793
- Were you followed?
- No.

397
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:01,171
In about five minutes,
Judicial raiders are gonna be here.

398
00:32:01,172 --> 00:32:02,506
I've got three to talk.

399
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:05,967
- W... Why are you...
- [shushes]

400
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:07,635
[whispers] They can hear us. Okay? Don't.

401
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:09,304
Okay, I don't understand what you're...

402
00:32:09,305 --> 00:32:10,764
[whispers] Look, I've got this.

403
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:14,371
- An old hard drive?
- Yeah, and I need to get into it,

404
00:32:14,372 --> 00:32:16,895
but it requires some kind of authorization
I don't have.

405
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:22,818
[sighing]
Okay, um, what kind of authorization?

406
00:32:22,819 --> 00:32:24,570
Um, sys... something.

407
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:27,906
- Sysop?
- Yeah. What's that?

408
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:30,993
That's, like, reserved
for the head of IT, Judicial security.

409
00:32:30,994 --> 00:32:32,369
- That's not...
- And the sheriff?

410
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:34,954
- Yes.
- I tried it. It didn't work.

411
00:32:34,955 --> 00:32:37,332
That's because you need to take it up
to your workplace computer.

412
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:40,710
[scoffs] No, I can't go there.

413
00:32:40,711 --> 00:32:43,630
Um, is there any way
that you can work around it?

414
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:45,464
Please.

415
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,177
I think this drive holds
the answers to a lot of questions.

416
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:49,595
What kind of questions?

417
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:52,054
Like w-why Holston's wife
went out to clean.

418
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,640
What happened to George.
Why Jahns and Marnes were killed.

419
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:57,853
- They were... I'm sorry, they were what?
- Yeah, they were murdered.

420
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:00,647
Um... [stammers] ...why?

421
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:02,941
And who's George?

422
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:06,111
He was a friend.

423
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,029
A friend?

424
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:10,490
Oh.

425
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:16,205
- Well, that explains a lot.
- No, I don't have time for this.

426
00:33:16,206 --> 00:33:17,872
- To use me? Clearly.
- Yeah. You know what?

427
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:20,501
Right now I'm using you
'cause I have no other choice.

428
00:33:20,502 --> 00:33:22,668
And you should want to help me.

429
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,838
You're the one sitting
in the cafeteria every single night,

430
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,631
wondering what's out there.

431
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:29,176
What if the answers
to your questions are on this drive?

432
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:33,138
W-Well, I don't think that I should be
trying to open something

433
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:35,640
- that I'm not authorized to open.
- No, but I am.

434
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:38,143
Yes, Juliette,
but the rules apply to everyone.

435
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,379
- What the fuck?
- [mirror shattering]

436
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:50,613
[sighs]

437
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:52,156
Look at this.

438
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:53,699
A sensor. A camera.

439
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,286
This is how they look at us.
This is how they control us.

440
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:02,709
- These... These are in our homes?
- These are everywhere.

441
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,504
And if we don't figure out the truth,
no one else will.

442
00:34:05,505 --> 00:34:09,174
So, please help me.

443
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,802
- Please.
- I, uh...

444
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:16,430
Even if I could, my mom...

445
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:17,723
- I'm the only one...
- Your mom?

446
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:19,558
Yes, I'm the only one
taking care of her right now.

447
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,394
- If something happens to me, I can't...
- It's...

448
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,229
Time's up.

449
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,148
You better leave too. For your mom's sake.

450
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:27,818
- Juliette.
- [door closes]

451
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:29,757
[breathing shakily]

452
00:34:29,758 --> 00:34:31,697
Fuck. Juliette.

453
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,834
[banging on door]

454
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:50,799
Juliette Nichols. By Judicial
order, open the door immediately.

455
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:54,719
[object thudding against door]

456
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,303
[door breaking]

457
00:34:56,304 --> 00:34:58,807
[citizens chattering]

458
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:03,060
ID and bag, please.

459
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:05,439
- Bag was checked upstairs. I'm in a hurry.
- ID and bag, please.

460
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,399
Are you serious? Do you know who I am?

461
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,774
- Ma'am.
- This is my ID.

462
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,651
- Open your bag.
- Where is your supervisor?

463
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:13,532
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Wherever they are, they won't be pleased.

464
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:15,657
This is your sheriff, and she's with me.

465
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:16,867
Uh, but...

466
00:35:17,659 --> 00:35:19,870
Oh, now you're questioning the mayor too?

467
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,834
You arrested Sims.
Now there's checkpoints.

468
00:35:26,835 --> 00:35:29,003
- What the fuck is going on, Sheriff?
- You were right. Okay?

469
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:31,882
Judicial is planning a takeover,
but Meadows is not the one behind it.

470
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:34,551
- It's Sims.
- Can't be.

471
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:37,887
Robert is so by the book.

472
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:39,805
[inhales sharply] We can't talk here.

473
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:42,518
- I know a place. It's a bit of a walk.
- Okay.

474
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,943
Okay. [breathes deeply]

475
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:54,905
We're about as alone as we can get
in the Silo.

476
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:56,822
Walk me through it.

477
00:35:56,823 --> 00:35:59,409
You think Sims
is secretly running Judicial?

478
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,578
Yeah. It's not the judge.

479
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:04,091
- Well, what does Sims want?
- I don't know.

480
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:07,083
Control the Silo? Cover up a crime?

481
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:09,086
I don't know.
Whatever it is, he wants me gone.

482
00:36:09,087 --> 00:36:11,672
And after you, me. [inhales sharply]

483
00:36:11,673 --> 00:36:14,258
[sighs] I never wanted this fucking job.

484
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,175
[exhales deeply]

485
00:36:16,176 --> 00:36:17,553
What are they looking for?

486
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,221
What do... What do you mean?

487
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:23,725
Well, they searched your apartment.
Now there's checkpoints everywhere.

488
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:27,354
What do you have that's so threatening?

489
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,107
[stammers]
I don't know what you're talking about.

490
00:36:31,108 --> 00:36:34,695
The clock is running, Juliette.
There isn't much time left.

491
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:36,887
If you have the hard drive, then...

492
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:40,784
Fuck me.

493
00:36:41,827 --> 00:36:43,120
I said, "hard drive."

494
00:36:44,538 --> 00:36:46,373
How would I know that it's a hard drive?

495
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:50,335
- Oops.
- [Juliette breathing heavily]

496
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:52,879
[gasps, pants]

497
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,549
You. You're the one.

498
00:36:57,384 --> 00:37:01,805
I'm sorry, Sheriff Nichols.
Did you just say you want to go outside?

499
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:05,391
No, no. No, I didn't.

500
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:08,373
I distinctly heard you say you want
to go outside.

501
00:37:08,374 --> 00:37:11,356
- Robert, did you hear that?
- [Sims] Sure did.

502
00:37:11,357 --> 00:37:12,732
No.

503
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,818
That's two sheriffs in as many weeks.

504
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:17,320
What is it about being sheriff these days?

505
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:19,990
You're the one. [breathes shakily]
Meadows isn't afraid of him.

506
00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:22,534
She... She's afraid of you.

507
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:25,329
Yeah.

508
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,876
The Founders knew someone
would have to make the hard decisions

509
00:37:30,877 --> 00:37:32,377
to keep our Silo alive.

510
00:37:33,086 --> 00:37:38,008
A person that possessed the knowledge,
the intelligence,

511
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:41,303
the information about everything
that happens here.

512
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:43,889
Lucky me.

513
00:37:44,848 --> 00:37:47,601
Why would you kill all those people?

514
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:49,852
I don't... I don't understand.

515
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:53,481
Miss Nichols,
throughout our entire existence,

516
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:57,110
problems have arisen
that must be taken care of.

517
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:03,283
The needs of the many
require the sacrifices of the few.

518
00:38:03,284 --> 00:38:04,368
For what?

519
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:07,829
For a hard drive
and some fucking heat tape?

520
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,080
This isn't about heat tape.

521
00:38:09,081 --> 00:38:10,331
This is about survival.

522
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:11,958
And that hard drive threatens the lives

523
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,918
- of everyone in this Silo.
- [footsteps approaching]

524
00:38:13,919 --> 00:38:18,423
[Bernard] And you are the greatest threat
to our home in 140 years.

525
00:38:18,424 --> 00:38:20,738
Well, you were.

526
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:23,053
[breathing heavily]

527
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:28,600
[panting]

528
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:42,364
[both grunting, groaning]

529
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:47,032
- [Juliette grunting, screaming]
- [raider grunting]

530
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,249
- [raider 2 yelling]
- [Juliette grunting, groaning]

531
00:38:58,172 --> 00:38:59,881
[Juliette groans]

532
00:38:59,882 --> 00:39:01,466
Where are her friends?

533
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:03,259
Her sister. Her aunt.

534
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,420
- [Pete] You know why they're not...
- They're cowards.

535
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,222
That's not...

536
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:09,765
[sighs]

537
00:39:09,766 --> 00:39:12,477
If she'd died of a heart attack,
they'd all be here.

538
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:17,024
[exhales deeply] I know it feels
like more should be done, but...

539
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:18,108
But nothing.

540
00:39:20,152 --> 00:39:21,153
They're cowards.

541
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:23,363
So was she.

542
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:27,034
Jules.

543
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:42,925
[Juliette] Go on. Leave!

544
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:46,512
Leave! Leave, damn it! Leave!

545
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:55,395
[grunting]

546
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,901
[groaning, panting]

547
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:05,572
I told you you'd regret arresting me.

548
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,586
[breathing heavily, groans]

549
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,672
[citizens chattering]

550
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:25,091
You got this from Hank?

551
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:27,886
[Shirley] All of the sheriff's stations
got a message ten minutes ago.

552
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:31,139
No, it doesn't make any sense.
Look, she was on her way here.

553
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:33,684
- Who were the witnesses?
- [Shirley] The mayor.

554
00:40:33,685 --> 00:40:35,893
- Some Judicial raiders.
- Oh.

555
00:40:35,894 --> 00:40:38,272
Yeah, let's believe them.
They never lied to us before.

556
00:40:38,273 --> 00:40:40,481
I'm just telling you what I heard, Walk.

557
00:40:40,482 --> 00:40:43,610
All right. You're right.
I'm sorry, Shirley. I'm just...

558
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:44,778
[Shirley] I know.

559
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:46,864
[Martha sighs]

560
00:40:47,614 --> 00:40:50,450
Knox said they'd eventually punish us
for the rebellion.

561
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:53,620
I always thought he was crazy.

562
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:58,792
So? What happens next?

563
00:41:06,967 --> 00:41:09,552
Wait, Paul.
Please, please, please just listen to me.

564
00:41:09,553 --> 00:41:12,306
- No. I'm done trying to make sense of you.
- I never... No, listen! You need...

565
00:41:12,307 --> 00:41:14,141
You want me to enforce the Pact
when it suits you...

566
00:41:14,142 --> 00:41:15,474
- No.
- ...and not to when it doesn't?

567
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:17,477
- I never said that I wanted to go out.
- I can't do that.

568
00:41:17,478 --> 00:41:19,103
- [Sims] I heard it.
- No.

569
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,980
- As did the mayor and my agents.
- No.

570
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:23,191
More than enough evidence,
I'd think, Sheriff Billings.

571
00:41:23,192 --> 00:41:25,527
- I'm not sheriff until we finish...
- No. They're trying to set me up.

572
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:26,986
- Shut up!
- You're lying!

573
00:41:26,987 --> 00:41:29,823
Hey! If you believe you were misheard,
you have the right to request a hearing.

574
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:30,907
- Do I? Do I? With who?
- Yes!

575
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:33,035
- With Judicial? He's fucking Judicial!
- [punch lands]

576
00:41:33,036 --> 00:41:36,830
- [Juliette groaning, gasping]
- I said shut up!

577
00:41:37,456 --> 00:41:38,664
[Juliette gasping]

578
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:40,250
That was uncalled for, Robert!

579
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:44,713
I warned her.
Make sure you mention that in your report.

580
00:41:44,714 --> 00:41:46,757
[Juliette gasping]

581
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,887
What are you looking at?

582
00:41:58,602 --> 00:42:00,062
- [Juliette gasping]
- Hey.

583
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:03,148
[both breathing heavily]

584
00:42:03,857 --> 00:42:05,150
Oh, shit.

585
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:11,281
- [Paul panting]
- [Juliette grunts]

586
00:42:11,282 --> 00:42:12,490
[Paul groans]

587
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:13,951
- [Juliette grunts]
- [Sims groans]

588
00:42:13,952 --> 00:42:16,036
[Juliette panting]

589
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,581
[Paul] Don't!
