1
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,721
Why did you wanna hide this?

2
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:56,932
[knocking]

3
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,059
- Who is it?
- [porter] Porter.

4
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:01,436
[Juliette] Two secs.

5
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,319
[breathes heavily]

6
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,614
Thanks.

7
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:28,088
I'm guessing he had his skull crushed in
with the butt of his own shotgun.

8
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,841
It couldn't have been easy.

9
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,887
Marnes was made of iron, anger and spite.

10
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:36,096
Who are you?

11
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,473
- This is Paul Billings. He's your...
- [Juliette] Oh.

12
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,100
That's the guy you wanted to be sheriff.

13
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,894
He's your new Chief Deputy.

14
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:43,896
The old one's not even cold.

15
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,198
[sighs] Well, Marnes was right.
Someone really wanted him dead.

16
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:56,824
Do we have control of this?

17
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,828
- His door was open. A neighbor found him.
- Can we keep a lid on it?

18
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:00,745
We could try.

19
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:02,080
If we don't, we're fucked.

20
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,166
[knocking]

21
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,150
This could've all been avoided
if our new sheriff had posted someone

22
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:13,175
- to watch Marnes tonight.
- Your new sheriff offered, and he said no.

23
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,469
- So I heard. You should've ignored him.
- Oh, you heard, huh?

24
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,138
Yeah. I stopped by
and saw him and his bloody nose.

25
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:20,807
- Who gave him a bloody nose?
- One of his many fans.

26
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:23,727
It's the mortuary team.

27
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:28,774
All right... [sighs] ...let's go to my office.

28
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,317
My new office.

29
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,992
Can you tell them to give me a minute?

30
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,829
[Paul] One minute.

31
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,920
[sighs]

32
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,769
[sighs]

33
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,117
[Juliette] Hey, uh, you can go in.

34
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,502
I'm only gonna be mayor for a few months,

35
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:18,007
so I'm gonna try to drink as much
of Mayor Jahns's liquor as I can.

36
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,600
Hmm.

37
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,233
So... [exhales]

38
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,944
[sighs] What do we do?

39
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,987
Just keeping pumping the official line.

40
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,407
Two older people walked the Silo,
it was too much for them.

41
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,326
- See your doctor...
- No, we bury them together.

42
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:45,493
Sorry, what?

43
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,788
One funeral. One grave.
Conservation of resources.

44
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,875
[Bernard] Times like this, people don't
give a shit about conservation.

45
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,254
But...

46
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:59,507
- we could say they were in love.
- [Sims] Were they?

47
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,885
[Bernard] The way they nagged
at each other, I always wondered.

48
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,469
Mmm. Doesn't matter, though.

49
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,890
I don't know if there's anything
in the Pact about a double funeral.

50
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:09,141
- Paul?
- For a married couple, but, um...

51
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,562
- The mayor can make an exception.
- Why would the mayor do that?

52
00:05:11,563 --> 00:05:13,355
So it becomes the story, Rob.

53
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,944
A couple of old servants of the Silo,
enjoying a late bloom of love,

54
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:21,425
looking to spend
their golden years together,

55
00:05:21,426 --> 00:05:23,906
only to have their lives
cut tragically short.

56
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,743
If they were in a relationship,
it was unsanctioned.

57
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,423
[stammers] At their age, who gives a fuck?

58
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:33,500
And if people do care, it's even better.
Gets people talking about forbidden love.

59
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:36,315
Anything but murder.

60
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:37,838
We need a distraction.

61
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,547
It's a good idea, Sheriff.

62
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,468
For a distraction, the judge suggested
we offer a Forgiveness Holiday.

63
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:46,722
- It's good for morale.
- It's good for Judicial.

64
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,685
Now, let's push
the story that they were in love.

65
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:55,022
Then I am going to announce
a Race to the Top.

66
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,608
Say Mayor Jahns loved a good footrace.

67
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:02,299
- Award the Jahns trophy to the victor.
- [sighs]

68
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,991
People love an excuse
to drink beer and yell.

69
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:07,742
Jahns hated those races.

70
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:09,828
She always thought
they would get out of hand.

71
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:10,913
Hmm.

72
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,711
I'll let you two go. Get some sleep.

73
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:20,005
Sheriff, would you stay a minute?

74
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,056
You know, you're the reason
I stopped by to see Marnes last night.

75
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:32,226
I said we should make Paul sheriff now.

76
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,144
Marnes said to wait.

77
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,188
Not because he thought you'd succeed.

78
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,399
He figured you'd realize
you were in over your head

79
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,526
and slink back down
to Greasetown on your own.

80
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,696
All right. All right, that's enough.
Give it a rest, Rob.

81
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,829
[sighs]

82
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,831
[door opens]

83
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,127
[door closes]

84
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,421
You don't like it.

85
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:07,344
I'm installing Billings as Chief Deputy
without your say-so.

86
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,556
Have you read the Pact?

87
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Yeah, some of it.

88
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,559
Start with the section on your department.

89
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,273
It doesn't explicitly say
that a sheriff should kiss Judicial's ass,

90
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:22,860
but it's pretty much
the subtext on every page.

91
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:29,408
[funeral band playing]

92
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,647
- Um...
- [music fades]

93
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:05,234
This morning, I ran a program

94
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:11,491
to create a data set
of Silo residents under the age of 46.

95
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:18,957
A number I arrived at
by taking 40 and adding 6.

96
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:24,046
Forty being the amount of years
that Ruth Jahns served as mayor,

97
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:28,634
and six being the age
of basic societal awareness,

98
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:30,344
giving a total...

99
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:37,058
of 5,496 Silo residents

100
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:42,063
out of the current population of 10,112,

101
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:47,861
for whom Ruth Jahns
was the only mayor they ever knew.

102
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:49,362
Mm-hmm.

103
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:53,158
Mayor Jahns was a trusted
and beloved leader

104
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:58,497
because she knew
the residents of the Silo,

105
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,581
and they knew her.

106
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,041
[crowd murmuring]

107
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,128
[Bernard]
Thankfully, I am but an interim mayor

108
00:09:05,129 --> 00:09:08,507
until someone can be elected

109
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,636
to fill Ruth Jahns's very large shoes.

110
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:18,851
Um, and not her literal shoes
because she...

111
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:22,020
Actually, her feet were rather small.

112
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:23,689
- [chuckles]
- [crowd chuckles]

113
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,692
Hmm.

114
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:28,402
Uh, Sheriff.

115
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,155
Would you like to say a few words
about Deputy Marnes?

116
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,036
Um...

117
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,748
I honestly don't know
what to say about Marnes.

118
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:47,420
He and I didn't exactly, um, hit it off.

119
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,674
He, uh, he didn't want me as, um, sheriff.

120
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:55,095
I think he shared that
with a lot of people, I guess.

121
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,098
I didn't want the job at first.

122
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,269
But then I was told that if
the mayor asks you to serve,

123
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,313
you-you serve.

124
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:10,151
And here I am,
speaking at Marnes's burial,

125
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,738
in front of people
who knew him better than I did.

126
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,781
Sad people.

127
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,452
I'm not... I'm not sad.

128
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:22,581
I, um... I mean, it's...
it's sad that he died, of course.

129
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,210
But his...
His life, their lives, they, um...

130
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,879
they're worth celebrating.

131
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:35,594
They dedicated their lives to the Silo,
like we all do every day.

132
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:40,682
Like everyone does,
from the Up Top to the Down Deep.

133
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,529
Hear us, oh, Founders.

134
00:10:55,155 --> 00:11:00,244
Ruth Jahns and Samuel Marnes
served your Silo with their spirit,

135
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:05,749
and now will serve with their flesh.

136
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,503
Death into life.

137
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,674
Circle without end.

138
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:20,138
[funeral band playing]

139
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,937
[Juliette] Hank?

140
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,315
- Jules.
- [Juliette] Hey.

141
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:15,527
- Hey. [chuckles]
- What are you doing here?

142
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:18,739
Oh, I, uh... I got an invite to the burial.

143
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,115
Really? I didn't see you there.

144
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:24,160
Yeah. Um, funerals aren't really my thing.

145
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,684
Yeah, they're not really anyone's thing.

146
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:29,208
I'll pay my respects heading back down.

147
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,837
Walk said that, uh,

148
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,507
you found somebody
to help with the George stuff?

149
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,717
Yeah, we buried him today.

150
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,677
- Marnes?
- Mmm.

151
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,138
Shit. [sighs]

152
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,434
Hey. Are, um...
those supposed to be for me?

153
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,145
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

154
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:58,487
Look, you can't send a guy up 144 levels
with a tin of hush puppies

155
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:00,739
- and not expect him to eat a couple.
- There's one left.

156
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,157
- I'm a big guy.
- Mmm.

157
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:03,575
[laughs]

158
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:11,583
- How are you?
- Good. Yeah, I'm okay.

159
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,130
Walk sent you, didn't she?

160
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,677
Yeah, and Shirley. [sighs]

161
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,680
Yeah. 'Cause they're worried about me?

162
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,933
Jules,
everybody's worried about everything.

163
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:32,019
On the way up,
I said hey to my cousin on 72,

164
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,315
and he asked if, um,
it's safe for his kids to go to school.

165
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:40,112
- It's a dangerous time in the Silo and...
- And you're wondering if I can do this.

166
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:41,613
No, that's not what I'm saying.

167
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,438
- It's what it sounds like.
- Hey, would you listen to me?

168
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,414
I know you can do anything
you put your mind to.

169
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,667
But I also know
that none of us can do any of this alone.

170
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:58,630
Now, look, I've never won
Deputy of the Year or nothing,

171
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:01,758
but if you need anything,

172
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,887
I'm just a tin of hush puppies away.

173
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:07,890
- [people chattering]
- [footsteps approaching]

174
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:12,018
Deputy.

175
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:14,730
Sheriff.

176
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,651
- Hey, Hank.
- Yeah?

177
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:20,272
I don't like you.

178
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:23,984
- I got that.
- You're not qualified to be sheriff.

179
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:25,902
Can't disagree. Anything else?

180
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:28,655
Holston Becker was
the best sheriff this Silo's ever seen.

181
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:31,408
Marnes told me that something happened
between you two,

182
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:33,660
and that's why Holston went out to clean.

183
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:36,663
Hmm. Well, Marnes was wrong.

184
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,251
You took this job to find out
who killed George Wilkins.

185
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:45,379
When Wilkins died,
the Down Deep deputy sent a message.

186
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,051
Said an engineer named Nichols
claimed Wilkins was murdered.

187
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,263
Now the first thing you do when you
get up here is ask for Wilkins' file.

188
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:00,103
Here's the deal.
Everything in this office goes through me.

189
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,355
Yeah, you wanna get anything done,

190
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:05,858
whether it's find out who killed Wilkins
or get a new pencil,

191
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:08,111
you're gonna do what I want.

192
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,280
What's that?

193
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,199
Find out who killed Marnes.

194
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,825
Right. That's my job, so...

195
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,703
I don't mean just going along
with whatever patsy Judicial serves up.

196
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:21,040
- I mean, find out who really did it.
- Why would Judicial serve up a patsy?

197
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,877
Because Judge Meadows
doesn't give a shit about the truth.

198
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,674
No, the only thing she cares about
is maintaining order.

199
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:31,635
And when a mayor
and a deputy get murdered,

200
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:35,514
things could get disorderly fast.

201
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:38,892
No, they're gonna wanna find
the nearest warm body to pin it on.

202
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:40,184
Expect you to go along with it,

203
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,479
so you can keep the shiny badge
and the nice apartment.

204
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,939
But that would be a mistake on your part,

205
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,693
because they also wanna get you out
and Billings in.

206
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:49,736
Isn't that what you want?

207
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:55,784
Honestly, I may want you
to find out who killed Marnes,

208
00:17:55,785 --> 00:17:58,370
but Marnes, he wouldn't give a shit.

209
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,832
He just wouldn't want
Judicial sending some poor bastard

210
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,750
out to clean that doesn't deserve it.

211
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:19,640
I'll be back after lunch.

212
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,351
[Sandy stammers] Where are you going?

213
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,875
I'm gonna try and figure out
who killed Marnes.

214
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:27,024
Well, you should take
Deputy Billings with you.

215
00:18:27,608 --> 00:18:30,026
He knows the Pact, and you don't.

216
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:32,029
If you get this wrong,
even if you get who did it,

217
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,739
Judicial will throw it out.

218
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,076
Let's go.

219
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,518
Hey.

220
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,311
You Charles Martin?

221
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:05,728
What if I am?

222
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:07,731
[Paul] You rob a string of apartments
15 years ago?

223
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:09,524
[sighs] I did my time.

224
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:11,192
We just wanna know
where you were last night.

225
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,904
- You asking if I killed Marnes?
- Didn't say anything about...

226
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:15,697
Don't tell me he died naturally.

227
00:19:16,532 --> 00:19:19,493
If Marnes just had a heart attack,
then life really sucks.

228
00:19:21,495 --> 00:19:22,913
But it wasn't me.

229
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,667
I've been down on 62, getting tests.

230
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:28,544
Okay.

231
00:19:29,253 --> 00:19:30,254
[Paul] Thank you.

232
00:19:32,047 --> 00:19:33,798
Even if he wasn't in the hospital,

233
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,634
I'm sure he wouldn't have
been a match for Marnes.

234
00:19:35,635 --> 00:19:37,719
You saw his hand? He's got the Syndrome.

235
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:40,055
Where next?

236
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:45,644
- What?
- Where... Where do you live?

237
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:49,231
- A couple levels down.
- Okay. Why don't you go home for lunch?

238
00:19:49,232 --> 00:19:51,942
I'm sure your wife and your daughter
would love to see you.

239
00:19:51,943 --> 00:19:53,026
It's only 11:00.

240
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:55,237
I know. It's just...

241
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:59,157
it's been a lot, and, um, I need a moment.

242
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:03,287
I'm gonna grab a sandwich, read the Pact.
I hear great things about it.

243
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:06,290
I'll be back in the office by 1:00.

244
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,803
I stopped by and saw him
and his bloody nose.

245
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:21,513
Who gave him a bloody nose?

246
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:23,264
One of his many fans.

247
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:26,476
Patrick, we all knew she was headed
for the farm the minute she met you.

248
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:40,199
[breathes sharply]

249
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:51,001
Patrick Kennedy, it's the sheriff.
Can you open up?

250
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:31,875
[sighs]

251
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,379
[sighs]

252
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,870
Who are you looking for?

253
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,624
[stammers] Patrick Kennedy.

254
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,209
He's not here.

255
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,553
[Doug] "...serious violations,

256
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,180
both of which
will be initially investigated

257
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:13,894
by the Department of the Sheriff, being
reported to Judicial within one hour."

258
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:15,729
Read the part about accountability.

259
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,438
[knocks]

260
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,233
- Yes?
- [Paul] It's Paul Billings.

261
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:23,111
Come in, Paul.

262
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,492
Paul, you know Doug Trumbull.

263
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:32,996
- Of course.
- Doug's a candidate to be my shadow.

264
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:37,918
We'll get to the rest of this later.

265
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,556
Doug Trumbull? Your shadow?

266
00:23:51,557 --> 00:23:53,933
I only said he's a candidate.

267
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:57,104
He asked if he could be considered.
I didn't have the heart to say no.

268
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,274
Besides, it's always good
to have an excuse to read the Pact.

269
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,196
Our new sheriff okay with you coming back
to Judicial your first day on the job?

270
00:24:06,197 --> 00:24:08,365
- She thinks I went home for lunch.
- [chuckles]

271
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:10,492
What can I do for you?

272
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:36,267
- Hey, Kennedy.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

273
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:38,311
Maintenance said
this is where I'd find you.

274
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:40,355
Mmm.
I was sad to hear about Deputy Marnes.

275
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:44,193
I'm kidding. I was fucking giddy.

276
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:48,906
Yesterday you said there were two reasons
why we were stupid

277
00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:50,698
for wanting to talk to your wife.

278
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:53,619
First was, she's dead.
Uh, what's the second one?

279
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:57,831
You know what, I'm a little confused.
Are you arresting me?

280
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,666
- [Juliette] Nope.
- Then what are you doing?

281
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,126
I'm putting you somewhere safe.

282
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:07,758
- Hey, Sandy.
- [Sandy] Hi.

283
00:25:08,926 --> 00:25:09,927
[sighs]

284
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:12,888
[door opens]

285
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:16,433
- How's it going?
- Slowly.

286
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:20,270
As much as I revere that thing,
if I can't sleep,

287
00:25:20,271 --> 00:25:22,231
- I read a couple pages and I'm out.
- Mmm.

288
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:26,193
- How was lunch?
- Can I sit?

289
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:33,158
I didn't go home. I went to Judicial.

290
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:35,493
Oh, wow. Reporting to Sims already?

291
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,245
I didn't know
I'd fucked up that badly yet.

292
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,081
I know it's gonna take a lot
to earn your trust,

293
00:25:39,082 --> 00:25:41,916
and this might not be the best first step.

294
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:44,461
But I wanted to see
how their investigation was going.

295
00:25:44,462 --> 00:25:46,296
Judicial has its own investigation?

296
00:25:46,297 --> 00:25:48,131
They get level rep reports first.

297
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,719
And they get reports from people
who don't officially exist.

298
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,887
Right, listeners.

299
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,223
Not what we call them, but yeah.

300
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:59,059
- What do you call them?
- Friends of the Silo.

301
00:25:59,643 --> 00:26:00,643
Hmm.

302
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:03,021
None of what they say
is admissible in court.

303
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:05,566
But...

304
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:07,859
They can provide suggestions. [sighs]

305
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,864
- Wow, you look in pain just saying that.
- It's not in the Pact, so I don't like it.

306
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:15,158
Hmm. Who are the friends suggesting?

307
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,618
Ralf Melby.

308
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:20,162
He works down in Paper, first shift.

309
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:22,833
He could've made it to the Mids
to poison their water,

310
00:26:22,834 --> 00:26:25,251
he could've made it up last night
to get Marnes.

311
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:29,256
"Gambler, thief, two minor assaults."
Why... Why now?

312
00:26:29,257 --> 00:26:30,716
Have to ask him.

313
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:37,431
[Juliette] Hey, Sandy,
can you get me an arrest warrant?

314
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:39,641
- [Sandy] For who?
- Patrick Kennedy.

315
00:26:39,642 --> 00:26:41,851
- What? No. Ralf Melby.
- Kennedy first.

316
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:44,729
And then can you call me
on the radio once you have it?

317
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:47,608
- Where are you going?
- You got messages. Um. Hey.

318
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,444
Hey.

319
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:53,238
Nichols, can you just stop?

320
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,490
- Hey.
- I don't have time for messages...

321
00:26:56,491 --> 00:27:00,704
I don't have any fucking messages.
I just... I need to know what's going on.

322
00:27:02,581 --> 00:27:06,835
Billings went to his friends in Judicial
and came back with a name. Ralf Melby.

323
00:27:06,836 --> 00:27:09,087
They want me to waste my time
arresting Melby

324
00:27:09,088 --> 00:27:10,276
while they get their patsy.

325
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:11,464
- Patrick Kennedy.
- Yeah.

326
00:27:11,465 --> 00:27:12,924
That's gonna make me look incompetent,

327
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:15,761
they'll send me back to Mechanical,
and Billings gets the badge.

328
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,221
You sure they're setting up Kennedy?

329
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:20,682
I know a search is gonna turn up
rat poison

330
00:27:20,683 --> 00:27:22,142
and a drawing from Marnes's wall.

331
00:27:22,143 --> 00:27:23,185
How do you know that?

332
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:27,459
If he's their patsy,
you requesting an arrest warrant

333
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,025
means Judicial's gonna send a goon
to get him right away.

334
00:27:30,026 --> 00:27:31,109
That's why I'm going.

335
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:39,034
[announcer]
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

336
00:27:39,035 --> 00:27:40,494
[horn blares]

337
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:41,953
[people cheering]

338
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:44,081
[announcer] All the best to competitors.

339
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:56,301
Judicial. Open up.

340
00:27:57,302 --> 00:27:58,554
Looking for Patrick Kennedy?

341
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:02,683
Yeah, it took a while for Housing
to find out his wife died last year.

342
00:28:02,684 --> 00:28:04,685
They moved him to a single, like,
six months ago

343
00:28:04,686 --> 00:28:06,561
and moved an older couple in here.

344
00:28:06,562 --> 00:28:09,648
Maybe that's why Judicial's database
still has this down as his place.

345
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:10,732
I don't know.

346
00:28:11,233 --> 00:28:13,610
I only know this 'cause Marnes and I
came here yesterday.

347
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:16,213
I guess everyone makes mistakes, right?

348
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,575
Yours was planting evidence
in the wrong apartment.

349
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:21,368
[cheering continues]

350
00:28:22,786 --> 00:28:23,871
[metal clinks]

00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,039

Go! Get out...

[crowd cheering]

00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:36,777

- [crowd] Watch out!

369
00:30:39,632 --> 00:30:40,911
[spectator 2] Somebody help her!

372
00:30:49,142 --> 00:30:50,809
[Juliette panting]

00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:07,201

376
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:14,082
[breathing heavily]

377
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:21,714
[Paul] <i>I think I know who it was
you were chasing.</i>

378
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:25,010
Doug Trumbull, Judicial Security.
I'll get an arrest warrant.

379
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:27,929
I wish you waited for me to come with you.

380
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:30,473
Well, I was just gonna
check out Kennedy's apartment.

381
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:32,994
I didn't think someone was gonna try
and throw me over the rail.

382
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,982
Hey, what apartment number
did you have for Kennedy?

383
00:31:38,983 --> 00:31:40,776
2215, why?

384
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:44,112
I think maybe Kennedy didn't have
anything to do with this.

385
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:22,150
Douglas. What are you doing here?

386
00:32:23,861 --> 00:32:26,947
- I followed you once.
- Ah, that shows initiative.

387
00:32:27,698 --> 00:32:28,949
Skill.

388
00:32:29,616 --> 00:32:32,077
And a very troubling insubordination.

389
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,662
[swallows] I'm sorry.

390
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:37,457
Do you have any idea
what's behind this door?

391
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,751
- No, sir.
- [Sims] Good.

392
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:43,046
If I choose you to shadow me,
you will know.

393
00:32:43,047 --> 00:32:44,506
What happened to your hand?

394
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:48,093
[sighs]

395
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:51,054
- [Sims] You have the note?
- [Doug] Yeah.

396
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:01,565
Good. I think there's still a way
to make this work.

397
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:03,483
- How?
- Let me figure that out.

398
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:07,905
This is my favorite time.

399
00:33:09,948 --> 00:33:12,326
So quiet, so still.

400
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:16,788
Now, Douglas, that door I came out of,

401
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:22,044
first time I saw it,
my father showed it to me.

402
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:25,672
He was a janitor.

403
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:30,093
People looked down on him. On our family.

404
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:33,180
We all know the philosophy of the Pact.

405
00:33:33,722 --> 00:33:36,808
Everyone contributes
to the survival of the Silo.

406
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,145
But a janitor's still a janitor.

407
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:45,734
And I was just a janitor's boy.

408
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:49,363
My mother treated my father
like he was nothing,

409
00:33:49,364 --> 00:33:51,323
and he said nothing in return.

410
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:58,580
When I was 14, I got into a conflict
with one of my classmates.

411
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:02,125
Richard Elliot. Ah, he tormented me.

412
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:03,835
My father found out,

413
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:07,714
and I was terrified he was gonna try to do
something about it and only make it worse.

414
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:09,632
But he didn't.

415
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,263
Part of me was disappointed.

416
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,724
Then one day, I get to school

417
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:20,768
and Richard Elliot's crying.

418
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:25,524
Seems his father's been reassigned
to a job on 125, and they have to move.

419
00:34:25,525 --> 00:34:28,902
Just like that, my problem went away.

420
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:32,614
I was wondering if...

421
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:38,036
if maybe my dad
had something to do with it.

422
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:43,833
But he was just a janitor. Right?

423
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:49,339
Then, one morning, he says to me,

424
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,967
"Any more problems with that bully?"

425
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:56,429
I just looked at him.
It was something in the way he said it.

426
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,432
I just looked at him and asked, "How?"

427
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:04,938
He said he wanted to show me something.
He took me to that door.

428
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:07,607
He said if I wanted to shadow him,

429
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:11,862
I would have to make a decision
that would change my life forever.

430
00:35:13,655 --> 00:35:15,364
If I went through that door,

431
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:18,202
I could never tell anyone
what was on the other side.

432
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:21,997
Not my friends, not my family,
not my wife.

433
00:35:22,581 --> 00:35:27,127
They might think that I was nothing
more than a bookkeeper, or a clerk,

434
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:28,253
or a janitor.

435
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,256
But I would know the truth.

436
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:33,800
That the people behind that door

437
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:38,222
do the most important work of the Silo.

438
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:43,727
Work that keeps 10,000 people alive.

439
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:49,066
You fucked up, Doug.

440
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:53,362
Twice. Very badly.

441
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:57,407
- You fucked up with George Wilkins...
- You know what happened?

442
00:35:57,408 --> 00:35:59,660
...and you fucked up with Patrick Kennedy.

443
00:36:03,205 --> 00:36:06,792
But I've fucked up worse. Many times.

444
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:11,338
We're human beings doing the best we can.

445
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:16,969
What I'm looking for in a shadow
is drive and dedication.

446
00:36:19,555 --> 00:36:20,889
I've made my decision.

447
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:30,983
Douglas Trumbull, do you, of clear mind
and conscience, pledge to be my shadow?

448
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:32,608
Yes.

449
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:39,241
Are you willing to do anything to serve
and protect the people of the Silo?

450
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:40,950
Yes.

451
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:44,371
Are you willing
to give everything you have

452
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:48,709
to serve and protect
the people of the Silo?

453
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,793
Yes.

454
00:36:49,794 --> 00:36:50,878
Good.

455
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:55,340
No! [screams]

456
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:02,973
[body thuds]

457
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,602
[Juliette] Douglas Trumbull
killed Mayor Jahns and Deputy Marnes,

458
00:37:06,603 --> 00:37:08,854
and he wanted to frame Patrick Kennedy
for the murders.

459
00:37:08,855 --> 00:37:11,711
His intent wasn't only to, uh,
frame Kennedy,

460
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:14,568
but to kill him
and make it look like suicide.

461
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:16,736
So when I confronted Trumbull

462
00:37:16,737 --> 00:37:21,408
about planting evidence in an apartment
no longer occupied by Kennedy, he ran.

463
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,453
Last night,
knowing his arrest was inevitable,

464
00:37:25,287 --> 00:37:26,662
Trumbull took his own life.

465
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:30,417
There's a... There's a note in there
that we, uh, found in his pocket.

466
00:37:31,126 --> 00:37:36,089
We think he was gonna plant it on Kennedy.
Strangely, it kinda works for him too.

467
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:38,842
We, um, we don't know...

468
00:37:38,843 --> 00:37:40,259
[Meadows] Why.

469
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,097
You don't know why
a seven-year employee of Judicial

470
00:37:44,098 --> 00:37:46,016
would want to murder the mayor and Marnes.

471
00:37:46,017 --> 00:37:48,226
Well, no, but we...

472
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:50,627
I didn't work closely with Trumbull,
but I saw no sign of it.

473
00:37:51,188 --> 00:37:53,815
Mr. Sims, did you see any indication?

474
00:37:54,525 --> 00:37:58,028
I mean, Marnes was deputy in the Mids back
in the day when Trumbull was growing up.

475
00:37:58,029 --> 00:38:01,823
Maybe... Maybe they had some
rough encounters back then.

476
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:03,617
I don't know. We're gonna look into it.

477
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:08,747
Don't spend any more time on him.

478
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:12,876
We have the killer of Mayor Jahns
and Deputy Marnes, and...

479
00:38:13,627 --> 00:38:15,337
[sighs] ...he's dead.

480
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:21,134
This should quell the rumors
and conspiracy theories.

481
00:38:21,135 --> 00:38:22,344
Indeed.

482
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:28,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

483
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:32,604
I'll take the rat poison to the farms,
you take the rest to the office?

484
00:38:32,605 --> 00:38:33,689
Yep.

485
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:39,319
You already knew that the drawing
and the rat poison

486
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,029
were in the apartment before we looked.

487
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,198
- Mm-hmm.
- When did you go in?

488
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:46,033
When you were talking
to your Judicial friends.

489
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:49,413
- How'd you get in?
- I learned some things in Mechanical.

490
00:38:49,414 --> 00:38:51,748
You clearly
didn't read the section of the Pact

491
00:38:51,749 --> 00:38:54,084
- about illegal search and seizure.
- No, I did.

492
00:38:54,085 --> 00:38:55,764
Why didn't you tell me
what you were doing?

493
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:58,589
- 'Cause I didn't trust you.
- Do you now?

494
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:02,134
Yeah. Sure. As much as you trust me.

495
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:20,110
So you don't worry what happened
to me tomorrow, I've been reassigned.

496
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,947
- What?
- To the station on 105.

497
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:26,700
Why?

498
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:28,827
I requested it.

499
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:31,663
'Cause of me?

500
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:34,291
No, I've got family down there.

501
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,089
Wait, so when...
when you said if I wanted your help,

502
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,091
I had to find out who killed Marnes.

503
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:49,681
Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't think
you'd be able to do that, really. [sighs]

504
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:53,059
Any chance you'd change your mind?

505
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,480
[scoffs]
No, I've had enough of the Up Top.

506
00:39:58,398 --> 00:40:01,568
You know, there are a few things
I'll miss, but... [inhales deeply]

507
00:40:01,569 --> 00:40:03,487
...I won't miss the feeling
I'm being watched.

508
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:06,322
By who?

509
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:09,201
I don't know by who.

510
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:11,578
Or how.

511
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:19,211
Hey. You know, when I got here, you said
you didn't know what Down Deepers ate.

512
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,003
You got family on 105?

513
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:22,672
That's lower Mids, not Down Deep.

514
00:40:22,673 --> 00:40:23,966
- Right.
- Our kind don't eat babies.

515
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,300
Mm-hmm.

516
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:29,471
You did a good thing.

517
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:36,812
I mean, Patrick Kennedy's an awful
human being but he didn't deserve to die.

518
00:40:36,813 --> 00:40:39,606
- Not for something he didn't do.
- I'm just happy that I didn't...

519
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:41,942
Don't make a big deal out of it.
I still don't like you.

520
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,028
Sheriff.

521
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:52,327
[Juliette sighs]

522
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:57,456
[Bernard] <i>Can I pour you a drink?</i>

523
00:40:57,457 --> 00:41:00,502
I'm going through Mayor Jahns's collection
pretty fast.

524
00:41:00,503 --> 00:41:02,296
- No, I'm good. Thanks.
- You sure?

525
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:04,256
- Yeah.
- Have a seat.

526
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:14,099
Now, as much as I hate to give Sims
the satisfaction,

527
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,350
I think he may have been right.

528
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:18,603
The Race to the Top was a good tonic,

529
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:21,273
but what we really need
is a Forgiveness Holiday.

530
00:41:22,482 --> 00:41:25,651
People go a little wild when we have one,

531
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:28,113
so I'm gonna need you
and your deputies everywhere.

532
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:30,866
Okay.

533
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,952
That's not the only thing
I wanted to discuss.

534
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:39,583
I wanted to say that I was wrong
about you.

535
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:46,089
I didn't see why Holston would want you
to be sheriff, but now I think I do.

536
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,258
So, for as long as I'm mayor,

537
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:52,846
which I sincerely hope won't be
for more than a few months,

538
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:56,350
I wanna help you in any way I can.

539
00:41:56,934 --> 00:41:58,393
Is there anything you need now?

540
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:05,400
- Two days off.
- You've been sheriff for a minute?

541
00:42:05,401 --> 00:42:07,318
I need to get back down to Mechanical.

542
00:42:07,319 --> 00:42:09,988
I didn't think I'd last
so, I didn't pack much, so...

543
00:42:09,989 --> 00:42:11,906
We have porters that can do that.

544
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:15,410
I'd like to say goodbyes
and stuff, you know? [sighs]

545
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:18,789
All right. We'll see you in a couple days.

546
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,291
Thanks.

547
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:42,187
Hey.

548
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:44,022
Hey.

549
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:46,191
What are you working on?

550
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:49,278
You wanna come see?

551
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:02,875
So, when it's clear at night,
there are these lights in the sky.

552
00:43:05,836 --> 00:43:07,649
Hmm. What are they?

553
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,464
I have no idea.

554
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:14,093
But I've been watching them long enough
to see these patterns.

555
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:19,266
They repeat, like they're, uh,
like they're traveling in this big circle.

556
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:23,812
Here.

557
00:43:24,813 --> 00:43:26,481
[chuckles] Here.

558
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:31,195
You see it?

559
00:43:34,364 --> 00:43:36,116
- [Juliette] I see a "W".
- [Lukas chuckles]

560
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:39,578
- Never noticed that before.
- Yeah, well, now you have.

561
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:48,003
I'll just add it to the list of
things we don't know anything about.

562
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:44,393
[Juliette] <i>Did you know there are lights
in the sky at night?</i>

563
00:44:44,394 --> 00:44:45,476
[Martha] <i>How do you mean?</i>

564
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:49,022
Well, the display in the Up Top cafeteria
is better than ours.

565
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,442
- What a surprise.
- There are lights in the night sky.

566
00:44:52,943 --> 00:44:54,027
Yeah, what are they?

567
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:56,655
I thought maybe you'd know.

568
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:59,867
You know, Hank ate all
but one of the hush puppies you sent.

569
00:44:59,868 --> 00:45:03,120
Hmm? I kinda thought he'd eat 'em all.

570
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:04,872
He's a big guy.

571
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:07,916
How old is this?

572
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:09,585
What day is it?

573
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:16,884
So, how's it going in that fancy new job
of yours up there?

574
00:45:18,218 --> 00:45:19,552
- Fine.
- Fine? Really?

575
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:21,262
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, Tommy Marshall

576
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:24,099
was working on a ventilation fan
at the foot of the stairs.

577
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:28,353
This missed his head by an inch.

578
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:30,897
People saw you hanging from the rails.

579
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:35,027
Jules, you don't think that kind of story
gets around? What the fuck is going on?

580
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:36,987
- I can't tell you.
- You can't tell me...

581
00:45:36,988 --> 00:45:38,113
No, I can't.

582
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:43,868
Goddamn it.
This isn't supposed to be the deal.

583
00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:46,788
We're supposed to go about our business,
keeping the Silo humming,

584
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:49,583
and they're not supposed to do things
like murder people.

585
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:52,293
Bodies start falling,
people start asking questions.

586
00:45:52,294 --> 00:45:55,359
Pretty soon, asking questions turns
into demanding answers,

587
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,310
- and if folks don't like the answers...
- Hey, hey, hey.

588
00:45:58,311 --> 00:46:01,261
You're talking about rebellion?
I'm right here. I'm sheriff.

589
00:46:01,887 --> 00:46:02,887
Ridiculous.

590
00:46:04,431 --> 00:46:06,975
Anyway, did you find
that hard drive you were looking for?

591
00:46:06,976 --> 00:46:09,268
No, not yet. Holston hid a file on George,

592
00:46:09,269 --> 00:46:11,522
but there was nothing in it
that I didn't already know.

593
00:46:11,523 --> 00:46:12,605
[Martha sighs]

594
00:46:12,606 --> 00:46:14,399
Did you make headway
with the thing I left you?

595
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,484
[Martha] Yes, I did.

596
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:19,612
So, I recognized the type of lens

597
00:46:19,613 --> 00:46:23,616
from those cameras they use
to make pictures for ID's.

598
00:46:23,617 --> 00:46:27,621
But those are very simple.
This... This is not simple.

599
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:30,290
Take a look.

600
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:37,756
This help you?

601
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,926
[Juliette]
No. You got anything more powerful?

602
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:45,055
Like the thing your mother made?
Lining up two lenses?

603
00:46:45,056 --> 00:46:46,639
Yeah, like we used on the rabbit.

604
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,352
Yeah, and Judicial destroyed it.
Do you know why Judicial destroyed it?

605
00:46:50,353 --> 00:46:53,021
- No.
- Have you read the Pact?

606
00:46:53,605 --> 00:46:55,565
No, and you're, like,
the tenth person to ask me that.

607
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:58,235
Well, this is the real reason
why I wanted you to come down.

608
00:46:58,236 --> 00:47:01,738
For me, there are two big mysteries
about the Pact.

609
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:03,489
One.

610
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,327
They stipulate that we can't mechanize
the way we go up and down in the Silo.

611
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:09,371
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- No lifts, no pulleys.

612
00:47:09,872 --> 00:47:14,126
Two.
No magnification beyond a certain power.

613
00:47:15,252 --> 00:47:18,338
So, a relic like this is gonna get you
more than a slap on the wrist.

614
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,841
Something with wiring this small,

615
00:47:21,425 --> 00:47:23,343
the effect is gonna be
a lot more dramatic.

616
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:30,184
And from what you're not telling me,
seems to me there's a long list of people

617
00:47:30,185 --> 00:47:33,082
who've died recently
under questionable circumstances.

618
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,981
What's to stop you being
the next one on the list?

619
00:47:35,982 --> 00:47:36,898
I'll be careful.

620
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:39,610
Put the badge in an envelope,
give it to a porter.

621
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:41,736
I need to find out what happened.

00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:44,865
Two days ago, Bernard wanted nothing
more than to send me out to clean

623
00:47:44,866 --> 00:47:47,409
for snagging two boxes
of shitty heat tape.

624
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:53,540
I solve two murders, and he can't wait
to work with me. They trust me, Walk.

625
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,125
I need to open up an investigation

626
00:47:56,126 --> 00:47:58,649
that allows me to look into
what happened to George.

627
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:01,173
And how are you gonna do that
without tipping them off?

628
00:48:02,174 --> 00:48:03,675
I gotta use the right bait.

629
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:44,758
[sighs]

630
00:49:33,891 --> 00:49:34,892
[sighs]
