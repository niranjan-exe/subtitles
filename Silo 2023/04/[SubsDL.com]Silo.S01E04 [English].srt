1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,759
[parent 1] Juliette, get the oxygen.

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:13,055
Okay, stay with us.
Come on. Breathe. Okay.

3
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:14,741
- [parent 2] Here.
- [parent 1] Got it.

4
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:15,765
[Juliette] Okay.

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,644
Okay, get a pulse.

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:20,938
Count the beats, baby.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,916
- One one thousand, two one thousand...
- [parent 1] Okay.

8
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,940
...three one thousand...

9
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:26,151
[parent 1]
We just need your heart rate to steady.

10
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,046
- ...seven one thousand...
- Pupils are reactive.

11
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,321
Pulse is slowing down.

12
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,073
[metal creaking]

13
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,826
[parent 1] Okay, focus. Come on.
Focus on me now. What's your name?

14
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,958
Come on, baby. Come on. What's your name?

15
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,044
[parent 2] He's okay. He's coming to.

16
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,447
[parent 1] Hey, what's your name?

17
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,466
Jacob.

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,801
[parent 1] That's right.

19
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,885
And who am I?

20
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,514
- Mom.
- [Mom] Good.

21
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,767
And who's this? What's your sister's name?

22
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,062
J-Jerk Face.

23
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,355
[laughs]

24
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,897
[chuckles]

25
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,482
[Mom] Hey.

26
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:08,026
[porter] Excuse me, miss?

27
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,655
- [porter] Juliette Nichols?
- [Juliette] Yeah.

28
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,074
Thank the Founders. [pants]
There's been an accident.

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,882
[indistinct chatter]

30
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,929
[Sims]
Sam, I hear what you're saying. I do.

31
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,391
[Bernard]
We're just asking for a little discretion.

32
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:40,475
[Marnes] Discretion?

33
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,477
[Sims] Bernard's not wrong here.

34
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,647
[Sims] It'll be bad enough
when word gets out she's dead.

35
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,693
Add murder to that and the situation
might become unmanageable.

36
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,570
[Bernard] People of the Silo need comfort.

37
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:55,407
[Marnes] You know,
if it's... if it's comfort that you want,

38
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:02,623
you can get me a focused Judicial list of
every criminal who's ever crossed my path

39
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:06,001
25 levels either side
of the Mids deputy station.

40
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,338
Fifty levels?
And the point of that would be?

41
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,758
He believes she was poisoned
by someone in the Mids.

42
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,678
It's rat poison. I've seen it before.
You can't taste it or smell it.

43
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,890
Whoever did this did this last night,
when we were at the deputy station.

44
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,683
Somebody broke into the station?

45
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:27,814
[Marnes] We went for a walk. That's when
the murderer poisoned our bottles.

46
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,692
Bottles? Plural?

47
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,946
When was the last time you walked
the Silo with somebody, Bernie?

48
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,281
Oh, that's right,
you don't ever walk the Silo, do you?

49
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,885
What you do is, you drink
from the bottles on each other's backs

50
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,036
'cause it's easier
than trying to reach your own.

51
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,998
And if Ruth's bottle hadn't had that leak,

52
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,128
I-I-I'd be lying on that floor too.

53
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,798
- You're saying she wasn't the targ...
- [wood shattering]

54
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:57,177
Don't say "she"!
You don't say "she" about her!

55
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,929
That's Mayor Ruth Jahns!

56
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,349
She carried every level
every election for the past 40 years!

57
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,810
There wasn't a soul
from top to bottom didn't love her.

58
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,105
Everybody she met... [breathes heavily]

59
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,733
Because I saw... [stammers]
She was v... [exhales sharply] You know.

60
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:20,200
[sighs] Fuck. [sighs, sniffs]

61
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,160
You'll have the list before daybreak.

62
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,498
We just ask, whatever you do,
you do it quietly.

63
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,626
[Bernard] Miss Nichols.

64
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,756
What the fuck are you doing here?

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,051
I had a porter retrieve Miss Nichols,
as she's soon to be our sheriff.

66
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,136
[Sims] She's not.

67
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,500
Well, she ain't gonna be sheriff
till she's been sworn in.

68
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,390
[Bernard] I'm well aware of that, Deputy.

69
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,767
But considering
the urgency of the situation,

70
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,561
I thought it best that she join us.

71
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,481
Like you would know
what the fuck to do here anyway.

72
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:54,443
Miss Nichols,
I'm Bernard Holland, the head of IT.

73
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,944
Oh, I know who you are.

74
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,156
In accordance with the Pact,
I am now to be Mayor Pro Tem.

75
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:01,700
At least until elections can be held.

76
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,037
As soon as I'm sworn in,

77
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,748
I'll come up
to swear you into your new role as well.

78
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,882
If you wouldn't mind heading over
to the sheriff's department,

79
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,593
we need to get you up
to speed as soon as possible.

80
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,070
[people chattering]

81
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,536
[sighs]

82
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,806
[parent] You're gonna have to eat in
the cafeteria or at school today, honey.

83
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,268
I gotta be down in the clinic early again.

84
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,271
- Are you gonna fix her chair?
- [sighs]

85
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,149
I don't think it's fixable, honey.

86
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,027
[breathes deeply]

87
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,322
I'm gonna need you to do me a favor.

88
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,993
Mom's stuff and Jacob's stuff
are long overdue in Recycling.

89
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:52,579
If we hang on to it any longer,
they'll come in and...

90
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,666
- [sighs] ...oh, we don't want that, right?
- No.

91
00:06:56,166 --> 00:07:00,087
After school, you pick up some crates
and pack up their things.

92
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:01,880
Everything?

93
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:05,384
Jules, we can't keep things that
could be used by someone else, all right?

94
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,262
Come on, get your bag.

95
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,807
I'll walk you halfway.

96
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,310
[sighs]

97
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,305
[Sandy] Are you Nichols?

98
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,390
Yeah.

99
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:14,995
Keys are yours.

100
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,457
One opens the main door,
the other this office.

101
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,043
[breathes shakily]
The third, Holston's apartment.

102
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,688
If you know your measurements
and shoe size,

103
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,840
write 'em down, and I'll get you
at least one uniform by tomorrow.

104
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:30,135
You bleed or sweat through that one,
you'll be wearing it all week,

105
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,970
so try not to get it filthy.

106
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:34,972
Yeah.

107
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,558
That's Holston's.

108
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,605
Yeah.

109
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:44,705
Oh, you can give it to me.
You'll get yours after you're sworn in.

110
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:46,401
No, I'll keep it.

111
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,445
Is there any food?

112
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,781
The cafeteria will open at 5:00.

113
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,575
Anything now?

114
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,994
We just, uh,
grab-and-go three levels down.

115
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,665
I was told to stock
the fridge in the apartment,

116
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,959
but I have no idea
what you people eat down deep.

117
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,297
Children mostly. Sometimes each other.

118
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:14,346
[inhales deeply] Um, what's in this?

119
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:19,351
- Firearms. Restricted items.
- Files?

120
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:20,727
Some.

121
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,145
And the combination?

122
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,357
After you're sworn in.

123
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,402
Right, listen.
I don't know if your issue is with me

124
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,880
or just with anybody
from the bottom 50, but I'm finding this...

125
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,698
- [Sandy] What are the files you want?
- Huh?

126
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,450
- You were asking about files.
- Just one.

127
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,829
Uh, George Wilkins. Mechanical.

128
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:45,669
Look,
I get a note from the mayor that says,

129
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:48,589
"Clean out Holston's office.
Nichols is coming."

130
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:52,092
I don't know who you are,
or why you're here...

131
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,969
- You haven't asked.
- I don't give a damn!

132
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,639
The only way I've survived this week is by
following instructions, and I don't need...

133
00:09:57,723 --> 00:10:01,810
I'm Holston's replacement,
which I'm guessing makes me your boss?

134
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,146
Yeah, I'm from the Down Deep.

135
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,149
I eat the same shit you eat.
Maybe with a little bit more salt.

136
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,234
Are we done with that?

137
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,156
Great.
Now, can you please get me Wilkins's file?

138
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,285
Can you get the door on your way out?

139
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,829
[Sandy scoffs]

140
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,457
Holston always kept it open.

141
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,685
[sighs]

142
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,866
[sighs]

143
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,378
- [mechanical clanking]
- Hmm.

144
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,633
- [manager] You doing this all by yourself?
- [Juliette] Yeah.

145
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,449
Hey. Let me see.

146
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,542
You're throwing
too many things down the chute.

147
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,208
Mechanical's complaining again, saying
90% of what you throw away, they fix.

148
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,627
Which is, no doubt, a load of shit,
but I gotta check.

149
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,005
Get it out. Run it again.

150
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,136
So, young lady, is this all your stuff?

151
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,306
My mom's. She doesn't need it anymore.

152
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,225
[manager] Is that so?

153
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,786
[Juliette] The other stuff's my brother's.

154
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,811
[manager] How old is he?

155
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:35,649
He was 11.

156
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,405
You can keep some of that stuff
if you want.

157
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,949
These guys,
they're not gonna know what to do with it.

158
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,999
What about your father? He around?

159
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,584
He's working.

160
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:59,840
You know, you shouldn't be
doing this alone. Not at your age.

161
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:39,713
[door unlocks]

162
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,889
Hi, baby.

163
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,474
[smoke detector blaring]

164
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,017
Juliette.

165
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,103
Goddamn! What the hell are you doing?

166
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,940
- I was hungry, and you weren't home.
- So you start a fire?

167
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,525
I was fixing the chair.

168
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,151
That chair can't be fixed.

169
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:03,946
- [beeping stops]
- It can, and I did.

170
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:08,116
I also took all of Mom
and Jacob's things down alone!

171
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,118
[sighs] Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

172
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,913
[inhales shakily]
This is the way things are now.

173
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,207
Because of you! [inhales shakily]

174
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,169
- No, Jules.
- I shouldn't have to do this!

175
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,630
[parent] Neither should I.

176
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,300
[sighs] What choice do we have?

177
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,018
- [Juliette sniffles]
- [knocks]

178
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,603
[parent] Jules?

179
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:38,730
Honey?

180
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:41,817
Honey!

181
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,652
[Juliette sobbing]

182
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,779
[parent] They're gone, and I can't fix it.

183
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,201
Not everything can be fixed.

184
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,245
- [crying]
- Jules?

185
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,088
[knocks]

186
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,840
[mechanical clanking continues]

187
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,554
- Hello.
- Hi.

188
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,054
May I?

189
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,265
[Juliette] Yeah, of course.

190
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:26,153
I'm sorry.
You can sleep with that noise?

191
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,155
Yeah, I can't sleep without it.

192
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:31,658
Well, if you wanna get it fixed,
I suggest reaching out to maintenance.

193
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,829
They're a particularly territorial bunch
but good at what they do.

194
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:37,414
I can handle it.

195
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,250
Well, it's your choice.

196
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:44,630
You'd be making an enemy,
but I'll let you work all of that through.

197
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:46,924
I am here to swear you in as sheriff.

198
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,886
- With a witness and your uniform.
- [Juliette] Thanks.

199
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:58,101
[Juliette chuckles]

200
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:00,312
What's funny?

201
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,481
Just that you'd be the one swearing me in

202
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:06,318
when you were the one who accused me
of stealing heat tape, just...

203
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:15,536
Miss Nichols,

204
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,497
did you steal that tape?

205
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:22,376
No, I appropriated it 'cause we needed it.

206
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,880
[inhales sharply]
You were not my choice for this position.

207
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:32,594
But... [sighs] ...considering recent events,

208
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,306
I think it best we let bygones
be bygones, no?

209
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,391
Of course.

210
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:42,521
Please place your hand on the Pact
and repeat after me.

211
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,199
[lock clicks]

212
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,053
I need your signature.

213
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:16,138
On what?

214
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:17,973
How's it fit?

215
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,435
Yeah, it's all right. Thanks.

216
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:24,897
These are the arrangements
for Jahns's funeral.

217
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,983
I'll handle it. You just sign. Here.

218
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,152
Should I read through it or...

219
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,696
You ever made arrangements
for a ceremonial burial?

220
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,115
- No.
- Then that's your answer.

221
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,493
[huffs] Is Marnes in?

222
00:18:38,577 --> 00:18:39,578
[Sandy] Nope.

223
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,959
Judicial says
they don't have a Wilkins file.

224
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,672
Holston did leave a file for you, though.

225
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,509
Uh, well, not for you,
but whoever got the job.

226
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,719
It's right there on top.

227
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:04,895
- [radio static]
- [deputy, on radio] Mids to Central.

228
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:14,613
- [deputy] Mids to Central.
- [radio static]

229
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,115
Mids to Cen...

230
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,911
- [door opens]
- Do you not hear the radio?

231
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:24,289
- Yeah, I figured you could handle that.
- Look, it's Marnes.

232
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,167
[grunts] You tell me.

233
00:19:27,251 --> 00:19:28,627
[grunting, breathing heavily]

234
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,337
Where'd you get the poison, Franky?

235
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,941
- I don't know. What the fuck? [groans]
- Marnes. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

236
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:34,005
- Let me talk to you.
- No!

237
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,318
Where'd you get the poison, Franky?

238
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,903
I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

239
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,367
Hey! You've got everyone freaked out.
There are kids watching.

240
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:43,718
- What the fuck are they doing here?
- [Juliette] Hey.

241
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,728
- You should be in school!
- It's lunch.

242
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,653
- Okay? Yeah?
- [panting] Yeah, okay.

243
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:11,879
[Juliette sighs]

244
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:14,548
[slurps]

245
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,719
Think there's another way for you to
try and find out what happened to Jahns?

246
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:22,890
You know, I've worn a badge for over
30 years. You've been sheriff half a day.

247
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,373
There's not a thing you can tell me
about how to do this job.

248
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,830
You know I didn't ask
for the badge, right?

249
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:30,439
Why'd you change your mind?

250
00:20:34,693 --> 00:20:36,573
I didn't know Holston
as well as you did, but...

251
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,173
That's the understatement of the century.

252
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:40,357
I figured if he wanted me to have it,
I should take it.

253
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:41,991
That's bullshit.

254
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:44,286
What'd you do to him down there?
What did you say?

255
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,489
- What'd I do to him?
- Yeah, what did you say to him?

256
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:47,789
[Juliette sighs]

257
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:51,084
The guy you beat up, Franky,
wh... what's his story?

258
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:56,924
A year ago, Franky poisoned two levels
with bad booze.

259
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,510
- Bad booze isn't rat poison.
- It's poison.

260
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:03,764
Am I the only one in the Silo who gives
a fuck about finding out the truth?

261
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:05,766
No, you're not.

262
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:09,394
- You wanna know what I said to Holston?
- Yeah, I do.

263
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:13,273
I said he should've listened to his wife

264
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:16,401
'cause if he had,
maybe she'd be alive right now.

265
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:17,528
You did what?

266
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:22,074
I told him someone had been murdered.
I proved it to him.

267
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,201
Knowing that was a possibility,

268
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,870
he said he'd still have to tell Judicial
it was an accident.

269
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:30,374
He was gonna send a sign
if he found anything, so I waited.

270
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:33,585
Next time I see Sheriff Holston
is with the rest of the Silo,

271
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,462
when he goes out to clean.

272
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:39,967
Then the mayor gives me this.

273
00:21:53,939 --> 00:21:55,148
[Marnes] "Truth."

274
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,154
You think that's the sign?

275
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:02,739
I don't know.

276
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,952
And that's why you
want George Wilkins's file.

277
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:10,539
Uh, Sandy told me.
Boy, she really doesn't like you.

278
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,791
[scoffs] Yeah, she's not subtle about it.

279
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:16,962
What do you want from me?

280
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:20,591
I want you to help me
to find out who killed George.

281
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:22,968
Why should I do that?

282
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,220
I'll help you figure out
what happened to the mayor.

283
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:49,119
You have to s-stand that far back?

284
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:52,080
If I hadn't moved my head last time,
I'd be wearing an eye patch.

285
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:55,834
[resident]
The fuck are you doing here, Marnes?

286
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:02,341
- Hello, Patrick. The sheriff and I...
- Wait, wait, who's this?

287
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,427
Oh, that's right. The new sheriff.

288
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,596
'Cause your old pal's outside,
cuddled with his lady.

289
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,767
Hey, Patrick Kennedy.
We are here to talk to your wife.

290
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,769
- [Patrick scoffs, chuckles]
- Right?

291
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,688
- Is that funny to you?
- Yeah.

292
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:22,069
- Go ahead, knock. Should be interesting.
- Why is that?

293
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,320
Couple of reasons, Marnes.

294
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,403
One of which being
that she's been dead for a year.

295
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:28,092
Surprised you didn't come to the funeral,

296
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,786
seeing as you framing her
is the reason why she's in the soil.

297
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:34,540
Yeah, uh, um, Patrick.

298
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:37,668
We all knew she was headed
for the farm the minute she met you.

299
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,002
Hey.

300
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,086
- Son of a...
- [grunts]

301
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,639
O-Ouch!

302
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:54,476
[exhales deeply]

303
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,647
I'm gonna have to follow up
on this Patrick Kennedy, am I?

304
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,982
'Cause he broke your nose?

305
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:04,611
No, because of robbery and extortion,
and a past jam with Judicial over relics.

306
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,364
[Marnes breathes deeply]

307
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:12,828
You ever see a hard drive
in Holston's safe or his apartment?

308
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:15,706
Check Recycling.

309
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:19,001
Any hard drive
or personal effects of Holston's

310
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,086
would've gone there
after he went out to clean.

311
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:22,588
Right.

312
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:25,799
You looking
for some kind of sign of Holston's

313
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:29,720
on this drive that'll lead you
to the truth about George Wilkins?

314
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,972
And what if you don't find it?

315
00:24:33,098 --> 00:24:34,433
[inhales sharply] I gotta try.

316
00:24:35,976 --> 00:24:37,102
[breathes deeply] Hmm.

317
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:43,233
Truth and trying mattered
to... [sniffles] ...Allison too,

318
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:44,401
and it mattered to Holston.

319
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:47,196
And... [stammers, smacks lips]
...you might wanna think about that.

320
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:51,158
Hey, with Jahns,
how do you know you were the target?

321
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:55,621
Forty years as mayor, and what?
She didn't piss off one person?

322
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:56,788
Not as many as me.

323
00:24:57,456 --> 00:25:00,584
Just... Listen, down in Mechanical,

324
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:03,712
someone's always got a theory
about why a machine breaks.

325
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:07,382
I deal with facts.
Jahns, she was poisoned which means...

326
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:11,136
Jahns was not a machine.
[breathes shakily] She was a person...

327
00:25:13,597 --> 00:25:14,890
like no other person.

328
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,239
[faucet runs]

329
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,457
[Juliette] How about that deal?

330
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:43,418
You help me, I'll help you.

331
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:46,380
And then I can head back to Mechanical.

332
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,799
You can get someone else to do this job,

333
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:53,178
while you... [inhales deeply]
...live the rest of your life in peace.

334
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,516
Wanna think about it?

335
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:03,313
In the meantime, um,
try not kicking down any more doors.

336
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,732
[Marnes] Yeah. All right.

337
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:10,612
Um... [inhales deeply]
...should we get a deputy outside?

338
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:12,614
You pissed off a lot
of people today, Marnes.

339
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,324
I got a shotgun.

340
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:21,665
You know, there are some things
a shotgun isn't the best solution for.

341
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,087
I'll be fine.

342
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:37,388
[door opens]

343
00:27:17,638 --> 00:27:19,640
[people chattering]

344
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:30,859
[resident] Good morning.

345
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:32,569
[sighs]

346
00:27:36,406 --> 00:27:38,033
[Martha] "Dear Miss Walker,

347
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:42,704
I'm writing to you to introduce you
to my daughter, Juliette Nichols."

348
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:45,582
[Martha] Juliette Nichols?

349
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:46,667
Yes, ma'am.

350
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:49,378
Hell kind of name is Juliette?

351
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:51,421
It's from a play.

352
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:57,427
"I would like her to shadow in Mechanical.
Signed, Doctor Peter Nichols."

353
00:27:57,511 --> 00:27:59,805
- That's my father.
- Yeah, I figured.

354
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:02,474
You didn't want to shadow him?

355
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,685
Sight of blood makes me queasy.

356
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:05,978
Plenty of blood down here.

357
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:10,524
You related to Hanna Nichols?

358
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:12,150
Yeah. She was my mother.

359
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:16,113
We don't get many visits
from where you're from.

360
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:20,784
Certainly not from kids
with notes from doctor daddies.

361
00:28:21,952 --> 00:28:24,705
- What good are you to us?
- I can fix things.

362
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:27,666
- My mom taught me to fix things.
- This ain't a toy shop, kid.

363
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,614
If that's all you got,
I... I think I gotta send you back.

364
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:32,629
- I'm not going back.
- [Martha] Oh.

365
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:36,508
Well, listen to me, little fixer.
This isn't the place for you.

366
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:38,760
Down here, mistakes cost lives.

367
00:28:38,844 --> 00:28:41,680
While you learn on the job,
you put lives in danger.

368
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:42,764
So, how'd they learn?

369
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:46,101
- Family. They were born into it.
- So was I.

370
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:49,396
You are your mother's daughter all right.

371
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:52,482
Hey, Knox?

372
00:28:53,192 --> 00:28:54,193
Knox?

373
00:28:55,694 --> 00:29:00,032
Tell Shirley to take this
Juliette character to the scavenge team.

374
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,841
- They've got five minutes.
- This is crazy.

375
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:21,512
The 12 Recycling stations are all
on different schedules,

376
00:29:21,595 --> 00:29:23,889
dumping once,
at an exact time, every hour.

377
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:27,518
But it times out so that every
five minutes something else falls.

378
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:30,354
They're supposed to only dump
stuff they can't reuse or fix.

379
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,397
But they get lazy,
so we find things we can repair

380
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,441
and send back up
or use down here ourselves.

381
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:35,943
Who'd want that job?

382
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:38,028
No one. They're criminals.

383
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:39,111
What did they do?

384
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,114
They killed, like, a dozen people.

385
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,577
[chuckles] They stole something
or beat somebody.

386
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:48,372
I have no idea. But stuff falls.
They drag it.

387
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,499
We sort it and fix what we can
in the next room.

388
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,544
The stuff that we don't use goes
to the incinerator.

389
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:55,712
Primo parts go to Walker. She has a list.

390
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:58,298
Find something on it,
you take it to her directly.

391
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,883
She never leaves her shop. Ever.

392
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:04,304
[resident] It's about time
someone from the Down Deep rose up.

393
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:07,516
[exhales sharply]
Gives all us bottom-siders hope

394
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:09,685
things might get better around here.

395
00:30:09,768 --> 00:30:11,854
[sniffs] What can I do for ya?

396
00:30:12,729 --> 00:30:15,607
Um, I'm looking for something
that might've come in

397
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:17,943
from the cleanout
of Sheriff Holston's apartment.

398
00:30:19,862 --> 00:30:23,740
I was on that cleanout.
A lot of tears that day.

399
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:26,368
[inhales sharply]
What in particular are you looking for?

400
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:31,206
A metal box about this big.
Could be a hard drive.

401
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:35,627
I'm also looking for about ten sheets
of paper, typescript with handwriting.

402
00:30:36,128 --> 00:30:37,588
That much paper, I'd remember.

403
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:41,133
But, mmm,
I don't recall seeing anything like that.

404
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:42,759
- I'll ask the others.
- No.

405
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:44,887
Just message me directly
if anything turns up.

406
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,139
- I'll cover the charge.
- You got it.

407
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:48,390
Okay.

408
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:15,876
You wanted to see me?

409
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:17,753
Hey, Jules.

410
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,339
[Martha] Come in. Shut the door.

411
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:30,766
When you forge a letter,
you should check the spelling.

412
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,393
Mechanical has an H in it.

413
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:36,063
Morning after you arrived,

414
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:38,357
I sent a porter to tell your dad
you were down here,

415
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,440
so he wouldn't spend
the rest of his life wondering

416
00:31:40,484 --> 00:31:42,319
if you'd fallen down the trash chute.

417
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:43,987
I'm not going back up.

418
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,822
Well,
you don't get to decide those things.

419
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:46,990
Not at 13.

420
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:58,001
Are you happy here?

421
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:05,884
I start work hours
before the lights cycle to day.

422
00:32:06,802 --> 00:32:07,886
I eat lunch standing up.

423
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,805
And if I'm lucky,
I get a half-an-hour break.

424
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:12,558
Every night, I am exhausted.

425
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:16,144
I fall asleep before my head hits the cot.

426
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:20,607
Are you happy, Juliette?

427
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:25,946
I'm happy I really don't have time
to think about Mom or Jacob.

428
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,951
Or me?

429
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:36,623
Yeah, you shouldn't have to.

430
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:45,382
Mechanical doesn't need anyone
looking for an escape.

431
00:32:46,091 --> 00:32:47,759
Mechanical needs workers,

432
00:32:47,843 --> 00:32:51,263
people committed to ensuring
the lives of others.

433
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,182
Everyone in the Silo relies on us.

434
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:54,850
So, if you can't commit to that,

435
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:57,978
I don't care where you go
'cause you're not needed here.

436
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,063
- But I am.
- You are what?

437
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:02,232
Needed here. I'm good at this.

438
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:16,288
[clicks tongue] All right.

439
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,627
From now on, you shadow Knox.

440
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,171
Yes, ma'am.

441
00:33:30,219 --> 00:33:32,221
[people chattering]

442
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:05,337
[groans]

443
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:15,722
[panting, grunting]

444
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:20,601
[knocking]

445
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,063
Who is it?

446
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:25,649
[Sims] It's Rob.

447
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,277
[Marnes panting] Hang on.

448
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,995
Wow. Love the new look, buddy.

449
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:39,371
Fuck you very much.

450
00:34:39,454 --> 00:34:40,998
Your new boss give you that?

451
00:34:42,498 --> 00:34:45,460
I got it from a guy named Patrick Kennedy.
Remember him?

452
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,670
Sold unsanctioned relics.

453
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:49,566
[Marnes]
He also committed a string of felonies.

454
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,674
Why'd he hit you?

455
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:53,510
Besides the fact
that you generally kinda invite it.

456
00:34:53,594 --> 00:34:56,096
[Marnes]
Uh, I went to visit his wife, Doris.

457
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:59,057
[pants] She'd threatened me a few times
and meant it.

458
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:05,022
But, uh, fortunately for the Silo,
dear darling Doris is dead.

459
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,525
A fact that didn't end up
in that list that you gave me. [pants]

460
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:09,878
[Sims] You know what they say, Sam?

461
00:35:09,902 --> 00:35:12,446
You wanna lose something forever,
give it to Data Management.

462
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:17,534
I forget how much people don't like you.
Who's watching your back?

463
00:35:18,035 --> 00:35:20,287
- Are you volunteering?
- [chuckles]

464
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,123
I have good news.

465
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:27,085
Judge Meadows is ready
to make the new sheriff a former one.

466
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:28,170
Paperwork's done.

467
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:31,048
You sign along with Mayor Pencilneck,
and by morning,

468
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:34,051
Billings will be Up Top and ready
to take over the job.

469
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,387
Yeah, well... [panting]

470
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:40,140
...I figure we'd better hold off
on that a bit.

471
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:43,185
- Why is that?
- [Marnes groans]

472
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:44,978
Nichols was Holston's choice.

473
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:47,272
I figure she's got a right
to fail on her own.

474
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,361
She knows she's not wanted.
She's not gonna last long.

475
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:55,489
Send her back down mad.

476
00:35:55,572 --> 00:35:58,158
She's just gonna get
Mechanical all riled up and...

477
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:03,580
It's your call, but Meadows
wants Nichols out and Billings in.

478
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:05,808
And you know when something
sticks in her craw, well...

479
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:07,167
Well, I don't work for Meadows.

480
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:11,088
But we all work for the good of the Silo.

481
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:15,050
You're right. For the good of the Silo.

482
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:33,694
Technically, I... I still have one minute
left before the cafeteria closes.

483
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:36,154
Okay.

484
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:39,908
Uh, Sheriff, uh... [chuckles]
Sorry, Sheriff.

485
00:36:42,286 --> 00:36:43,453
Lukas.

486
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:46,665
- Juliette.
- Oh, Juliette?

487
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:48,667
[chuckles] Like... Like the play.

488
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:52,671
- Yeah. You... You heard of it?
- [Lukas] Yeah, of course.

489
00:36:52,754 --> 00:36:56,466
Well, they don't really perform that one
anymore though, do they? [chuckles]

490
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,303
Oh, I... I... I don't know.

491
00:36:59,887 --> 00:37:04,183
Some people say it was written by,
well, a rebel. [chuckles]

492
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:08,979
Did I just say something
that you could arrest me for?

493
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,481
Oh, I wouldn't know.

494
00:37:13,317 --> 00:37:16,820
Okay. Well,
maybe I should just go back and get my...

495
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:19,990
Yeah, I think your minute's up, so...

496
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,243
Okay. [chuckles]

497
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:26,788
- Um, good night.
- Night.

498
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,085
[Marnes] You'd consider retiring?

499
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:17,089
Why not?

500
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:20,342
Maybe open a shop

501
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:24,221
right next to some guy who does drawings.

502
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:31,520
[Jahns] You know, I didn't come
all this way just to meet Nichols.

503
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:36,275
I wanted to spend time with you.

504
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:40,529
[cries]

505
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,077
And their great victory
should be celebrated with horns.

506
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,800
- [crowd cheering]
- [crowd blowing horns]

507
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:58,338
[sobs]

508
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:01,216
[radio static]

509
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,420
[Juliette, over radio] Walk?

510
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:07,514
Walker, you there?

511
00:39:07,598 --> 00:39:10,058
[radio static]

512
00:39:13,562 --> 00:39:15,564
- [Martha] That you, Fixer?
- Yeah.

513
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:17,691
Hey. Uh, I'm here.

514
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:19,818
[radio static]

515
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:21,028
[Martha] How goes the work?

516
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:26,742
Well, I... I might not be pulling alone.

517
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:32,080
[Martha] So, progress?

518
00:39:35,292 --> 00:39:36,710
Yeah, maybe.

519
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:38,545
[Martha] Did you find an ally?

520
00:39:42,216 --> 00:39:43,217
[Juliette] Perhaps.

521
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:47,721
I'll know more tomorrow.

522
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:50,933
[Martha] There's been
some progress here too.

523
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:54,770
Uh, in fact, something
that may require your insight.

524
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:58,315
Okay, give me a bit,
and I-I'll see what I can do.

525
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:00,526
[Martha] Okay. Thanks.

526
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:03,445
Uh, night.

527
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,407
[Juliette] Okay. Good night.

528
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:20,128
[whistling]

529
00:40:52,828 --> 00:40:53,912
[beeps]

530
00:40:57,082 --> 00:40:58,083
[beeps]

531
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,461
[door unlocks]

532
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:06,717
[sighing]

533
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:10,888
[exhales sharply]

534
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:24,860
[machinery whirring]

535
00:41:26,195 --> 00:41:28,197
[metal clanking]

536
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:37,873
[Marnes whistling]

537
00:41:51,428 --> 00:41:52,554
[keys clatter]

538
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:02,105
[both grunting, groaning]

539
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,327
[groaning, breathing heavily]

540
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:22,835
[groaning]

541
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:30,217
[groaning, grunting continue]

542
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:46,942
- [Marnes breathes heavily] Oh, fuck.
- [gun cocks]

543
00:42:47,025 --> 00:42:48,169
[Marnes gasps, breathes heavily]

544
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:49,403
[grunts]

545
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:52,322
[grunting, panting]

546
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:04,877
[metallic clanking]

547
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:13,427
[Juliette grunts, breathing deeply]
