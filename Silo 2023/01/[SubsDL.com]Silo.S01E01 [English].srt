1
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,807
[sheriff] <i>We do not know why we are here.</i>

2
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,569
<i>We do not know who built the Silo.</i>

3
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:24,376
<i>We do not know why everything
outside the Silo is as it is.</i>

4
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:26,920
Good morning, Sheriff.

5
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:30,132
Hey, Sam. You awake yet?

6
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,801
[Sam] I'm about halfway there.

7
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:42,769
[sheriff] <i>We do not know
when it will be safe to go outside.</i>

8
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,149
<i>We only know that day...</i>

9
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,737
<i>is not this day.</i>

10
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,041
Hey.

11
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,125
You're in early.

12
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,295
[deputy] Yeah, I couldn't sleep.
Got the damn leg cramps.

13
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,506
When you get your coffee,
meet me in holding 3.

14
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:36,657
Three?

15
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,028
You want some coffee?

16
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,258
[deputy] What are you doing?

17
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,534
[sheriff] I wanna see her.

18
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,661
[deputy] No, Sheriff.

19
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:27,349
I should've done it three years ago.
But I couldn't listen.

20
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,126
[deputy] Hey. Stop.

21
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,965
[stammers] Come on out of there.
Let's talk about this.

22
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,594
I made up my mind,
or I wouldn't be in here.

23
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,846
I'm sorry, Sam.

24
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,200
You're gonna say this to me
after all we've been through?

25
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,827
Want me to wait till Sandy gets in?

26
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,563
I don't want you to say it.

27
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:54,835
Please, Sheriff. Don't say it.

28
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,295
- Deputy Marnes...
- Please, Sheriff.

29
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,529
I wanna go out.

30
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,410
[sighs, sniffs]

31
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,955
[breathes shakily]

32
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,807
[exhales shakily]

33
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,335
While you get things rolling,
I think I'm gonna lie down.

34
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,104
[sheriff's wife] Are you getting coffee?

35
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,355
[sheriff] I am, I am!

36
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,009
Okay. I'll take milk, please.
Actually, no milk. I don't... I don't...

37
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,278
I don't need any milk. No.

38
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,180
- Come on. It's almost 8:00.
- Okay.

39
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,762
- [sheriff's wife] Please.
- [sheriff] Okay, coming.

40
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:33,393
[sighs] Thanks. [chuckles]

41
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,121
[sighs] I don't know why we're doing this.

42
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,582
We're not gonna get it.
We had two tries.

43
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,691
[computer chimes]

44
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,619
[chuckling]

45
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,014
I can't believe it. [sighs]

46
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,641
- [chuckles]
- Third time's a charm.

47
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,684
You're just excited to have sex every day.

48
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,520
Hey, you could be pregnant
a month from now.

49
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,755
- Please let it be more than that.
- [chuckles]

50
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,300
[sheriff's wife sighs]

51
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,719
You know I love you no matter what.

52
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,931
Shut up. We're doing this. Let's go.

53
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:14,076
Allie,
his office doesn't open for an hour.

54
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,828
Yeah. Well, we can get some breakfast.

55
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,412
We can talk about baby names.

56
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,165
Which will be me just humoring you,
because obviously,

57
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,209
if I'm giving birth
to this little critter,

58
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,169
I'm naming it whatever the hell I want.

59
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,421
[chuckles] Okay.

60
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,823
[Allison chuckles]

61
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,585
- Good luck.
- Oh, thanks. [chuckles]

62
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,146
- Congratulations.
- [sheriff] Yeah. Thank you.

63
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,338
Thanks. [chuckles]

64
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:46,775
- Hi.
- [people murmuring]

65
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,343
Oh, hi. Congrats.

66
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,013
Hi.

67
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,577
I really hate this part.

68
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,245
People are just happy for us.

69
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,398
Oh, I just wish everyone didn't know.
[chuckles]

70
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,001
Oh, shit.

71
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:06,211
Sheriff, Mrs. Becker.

72
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,380
I... [stammers, sighs]
I don't mean to intrude. [chuckles]

73
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,489
So don't.

74
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:12,718
There's your famous
tell-it-like-it-is manner.

75
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:13,886
Why everyone likes you.

76
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:15,954
If everyone likes me,
I'm not doing my job.

77
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:21,310
Mrs. Becker, your husband might not be
interested in what I have to say...

78
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,728
What I'd be really interested in

79
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,897
- is you leaving us alone, Gloria.
- Holston.

80
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,232
But whatever our sheriff
may have told you,

81
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,026
I provide fertility counseling...

82
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,736
Oh, yeah? Like what?

83
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:33,113
[chuckles] Your husband's waiting for me
to say something

84
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,240
I'm not legally allowed to say.

85
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,618
- Such as?
- Clever.

86
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:40,729
[Gloria] I have no desire to be sent out.
Thank you, Sheriff.

87
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:45,859
Mrs. Becker, if you have an open mind,
come see me.

88
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,071
I wish you both the very best.

89
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,634
What does she do exactly?

90
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:56,011
She goes right to the edge
of promising people a baby

91
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:59,122
if they do what she says, which is fraud.
And it's cruel.

92
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,049
[doctor] I'll let that go numb.

93
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:16,490
Now, after I remove the birth control,
it'll take two to three weeks

94
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,975
for your hormones to reset.

95
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:20,702
Now, that said, some couples
do become pregnant

96
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,204
within days of getting clearance.

97
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,997
But then, you know all this.

98
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,858
Is this your, uh... your second time?

99
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,151
- Third.
- And last.

100
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,320
I'm almost thirty-eigh... eight.

101
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,283
Can you feel this?

102
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,260
Just pressure.

103
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:40,455
[doctor] Well, even though you're numb,
it's still gonna feel weird.

104
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,917
We make sure
the capsule's implanted quite deep

105
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,187
so it never gives you any trouble.

106
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,522
[grunts]

107
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:52,843
- But not for long, as I am done.
- [grunts]

108
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,195
And there it is.

109
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,639
- [Allison sighs]
- You are no longer under birth control.

110
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:02,703
[doctor] You are now free to make a baby.

111
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:03,937
[Allison chuckles]

112
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:08,025
[chattering, singing]

113
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,508
Thank you, Mrs. Flores.

114
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,512
I swear if one more person
congratulates us... [breathes heavily]

115
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,181
Impregnate me. Now.

116
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:24,892
- Yes, ma'am. [grunts, chuckles]
- [chuckles]

117
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,060
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.
- Mmm. What?

118
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,770
[sighs] Remember last time?

119
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,356
At some point,
this is gonna start feeling like work.

120
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,258
- Best work ever.
- [chuckles]

121
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,453
[IT worker] We tried, like, four times
before we finally got clearance,

122
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:45,746
so now's your time.

123
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:46,855
[Allison] Yeah, let's hope.

124
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,582
{\an8}[IT worker chuckles] My cousin Charlene,

125
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:52,085
{\an8}she convinced her husband
he had to dye his unit blue.

126
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,170
{\an8}Did it work?

127
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,379
{\an8}- They got pregnant.
- [chuckles]

128
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,508
{\an8}But I'm sure his blue dick
had nothing to do with it.

129
00:10:57,533 --> 00:11:00,469
She was just fucking with him.
Gives you a clue to that marriage.

130
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,763
- Hello, Bernard.
- Morning, Bernard.

131
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,498
Karen. Allison.

132
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,559
[clicks tongue]
I see you posted an article

133
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,771
on our BBS about recovering deleted files.

134
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:13,398
- I did.
- You do know you need to get my approval

135
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:16,318
for any IT-related content
before it goes wide.

136
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:19,363
Well, I figured we could cut down
on service calls

137
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,615
if people could handle
some things on their own.

138
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,369
[chuckles] Hmm. I took it down. Your post.

139
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:28,413
I have no doubt your intentions were good,

140
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,875
but our reporting structure
is there for a reason.

141
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,151
- Got it.
- Hmm.

142
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,572
[whispers] Fucking asshole.

143
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,757
Did you know you were breaking the rules?

144
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:43,161
No. Maybe. Kind of.

145
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:46,306
There's too many rules.

146
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,766
Well, you wanted to work in IT.

147
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,711
It's not just IT. It's everywhere.

148
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,150
We blame the rebels
for erasing our history, right?

149
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:57,401
Yes.

150
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,154
So why can't we ask questions
about that stuff?

151
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,533
And if losing our history is so bad,
why can some goons from Judicial

152
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,909
send you down to the mines

153
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,036
if you happen to have a relic
from the before times?

154
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,146
Allison.

155
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:11,999
Really?

156
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:14,151
You're gonna use
your sheriff voice with me?

157
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,613
Honey,
the Pact is the only history we have.

158
00:12:19,031 --> 00:12:21,758
What if a bunch of rule-breakers
decide they wanna see for themselves

159
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,868
what it's like aboveground?

160
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:26,538
They somehow manage to open that door,
we are done.

161
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,292
Part of my job
is making sure that doesn't happen.

162
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,194
[Allison sighs, sniffs]

163
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,677
[breathes deeply]

164
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,787
I got my period.

165
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:10,249
I know, I know. We still have time.

166
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,148
[Marnes] What are you so afraid of?

167
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,777
I'm afraid some drunken, pyromaniac
adolescent with a cherry bomb

168
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,680
is gonna start a fire
that sets off a stampede.

169
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:27,825
Are you done? Is it safe for me to speak?

170
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,118
Since you've been wearing the sash
and we've been wearing a badge,

171
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,664
Freedom Day has gone off without a hitch.
And that's a long damn time.

172
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:35,290
All deputies will be on patrol,

173
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,442
and we'll have fire teams
on every tenth level.

174
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,840
[silo leader] It's getting harder to see
with every passing month.

175
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:45,659
A long time between cleanings
means things are going well.

176
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,619
No one wants a cleaning,

177
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,331
but people need to see
what it's like out there.

178
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:04,403
- Mrs. Becker.
- Oh.

179
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,013
- Hi.
- I was looking for you.

180
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,783
- Are you pregnant?
- Um, not yet.

181
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,994
But I'm afraid I won't be needing
your assistance.

182
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,245
- Take care.
- Oh, no, no, no.

183
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:18,650
That's not why I was looking for you.
I'd like to ask you a question in private.

184
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:29,328
Oh, I hate that term, "Freedom Day."
So simplistic.

185
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,623
"Put Down the Rebellion Day"
would be more accurate.

186
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,209
Ma'am, you said you wanted
to ask me a question.

187
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:39,605
Why'd you do that?

188
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,423
Because I don't want them to hear.

189
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,008
Who?

190
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:44,968
Well, who's got listeners?

191
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:46,845
Judicial?

192
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:56,246
Have you ever wondered
what was on the servers they erased?

193
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:01,944
In the books they burned?
If it was even the rebels that did it?

194
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,255
- I should get to work.
- Oh, please.

195
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,949
I didn't ask you here on a whim.

196
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:10,911
I've heard you're someone who also

197
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,121
wonders.

198
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:16,683
Who told you that?

199
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,644
Why do we live underground?

200
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:22,214
What actually happened out there?

201
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,675
- I'm going now.
- One last thing.

202
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:30,055
Do you really think you're the kind of
person they want having children?

203
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,644
[Allison] Three times with no success?

204
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:39,581
She just said it...
It started to feel a little intentional.

205
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,377
Okay. Now she has officially descended
from eccentric oddball

206
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,028
to completely fucking crazy.

207
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:46,797
I should send the psych team

208
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:49,633
- to pay Gloria a visit.
- Don't. She just...

209
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,261
Just what? Said something that upsets you?

210
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:54,763
She and her husband couldn't have a baby.

211
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,790
She wants you to find out why.

212
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,751
You had your birth control removed, Allie.

213
00:16:00,252 --> 00:16:04,606
We have the same shot at making a baby
as anyone who has clearance.

214
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,400
- [breathes deeply]
- Okay?

215
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:07,509
Okay.

216
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:20,747
You're not gonna like this.

217
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,902
Our buddy George submitted another ticket.
Guess whose turn it is to take it.

218
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,757
[sighs deeply]

219
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,677
He's a programmer in the Mids
with a repair stall in the market.

220
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,763
- Why do you have to go?
- Everybody's taking off for Freedom Day.

221
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:39,933
And because you're working,
I figured I would just be on call.

222
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,935
But he wants me to be there
first thing in the morning,

223
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,938
which means I have to go down tonight
and get a room in the hostel.

224
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:49,927
Also means that we will be missing
this evening's entertainment.

225
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:51,845
[Holston chuckles]

226
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,887
- [whispers] Honey.
- I know, I know. I'll be quiet.

227
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,368
- Not here.
- Yeah, here.

228
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,329
- Honey. Marnes is...
- Let's be quick.

229
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,438
[Holston] Okay.

230
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,083
[Holston moaning]

231
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,211
- [Allison] It's okay. It's okay.
- [objects crashing]

232
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:10,321
[Allison moaning, breathing heavily]

233
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,927
[thumping]

234
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:16,619
[chuckles, snorts]

235
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,263
[shushes]

236
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:21,415
- [Allison moaning]
- [laughs]

237
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,358
- [Allison, Holston groaning]
- [clattering]

238
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,984
[both breathing heavily]

239
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,486
- Holy shit.
- [chuckles]

240
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:36,114
[chuckling] If I don't get pregnant
from that, I never will.

241
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,641
[both chuckling]

242
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,804
[actor 1] We'll beat you to the top
and open the door to the outside,

243
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,682
letting all the poison into the Silo!

244
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:04,059
- [laughs]
- [children booing]

245
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,394
[actor 2] Not so fast, rebel!

246
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:09,148
In the name of the Founders! [yells]

247
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:12,693
- [grunting, yelling]
- [grunting]

248
00:18:12,718 --> 00:18:14,553
- [actor 3 yells]
- [children cheering]

249
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,849
- [band playing music]
- [chattering]

250
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,201
[yells]

251
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:43,498
- [music continues, louder]
- [chattering continues]

252
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:09,149
[speaks indistinctly]

253
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:23,263
[George] Allison Becker?

254
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:24,515
I am. You must be...

255
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,000
I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time.

256
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,860
Sorry about getting you down here
on Freedom Day.

257
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,822
I'm on call. My husband's working, so...

258
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,824
That's what I figured,
him being the sheriff.

259
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,308
Why I thought I might get you.

260
00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:47,688
I don't understand. How can I help you?

261
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:51,733
[stammers] Yeah. I... I read your post
on how to retrieve deleted files.

262
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:56,321
I had a feeling it wouldn't stay up long,
so I printed it.

263
00:19:57,573 --> 00:20:00,676
- That must have cost you a fortune.
- Yeah, worth every credit.

264
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:01,952
It got me a long way.

265
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:07,182
But I needed to see you in person,
so I put in a repair request

266
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,475
hoping I'd get you.

267
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,062
Of course, they sent everyone but you.
So then I thought with the holiday...

268
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,547
Why didn't you just ask for me?

269
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,591
I didn't wanna arouse suspicion.

270
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:17,818
From who?

271
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,553
Who wrote the law on relics?

272
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,239
You're worried about Judicial?

273
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,765
[scoffs] Isn't everybody?

274
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:26,577
Is this about a relic?

275
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:28,270
That's just it. I don't know.

276
00:20:30,939 --> 00:20:34,067
A guy came in with this

277
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:36,486
about a year ago.

278
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,782
Said he found it
under the carpet in a closet.

279
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,494
I fired it up, and it...
It looked like it was empty.

280
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,581
Then I tried what you posted...

281
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:54,713
and I was able to check the memory.

282
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,847
It... It says most of the drive is in use,
but I can't find any files.

283
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,993
There's something on there.
I just don't know how to get to it.

284
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,329
Could just be old family recipes.

285
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:13,524
[scoffs]
Then they're very old family recipes.

286
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:15,984
I checked the log in IT.

287
00:21:16,818 --> 00:21:18,737
There's no record of this serial number.

288
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:23,133
Course,
the log starts after the rebellion.

289
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:25,844
You think this drive
is over 140 years old?

290
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:28,972
That's impossible. All the drives
were destroyed in the rebellion.

291
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,415
Could just be an entry error.

292
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,628
Or not.

293
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:42,444
It might be as simple as just figuring out
the name on the directory.

294
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:43,554
- May I?
- Mmm.

295
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:46,573
Is there anything I can...

296
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,392
Not talking would be great.

297
00:21:50,644 --> 00:21:53,063
[crowd cheering]

298
00:21:59,862 --> 00:22:02,422
- Happy Freedom Day.
- Happy Freedom Day, Mayor.

299
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,866
Very nice to see you all.

300
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:20,757
[Allison sighs]

301
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:28,515
[sniffs, sighs]

302
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:33,211
[sighs]

303
00:22:36,398 --> 00:22:38,625
Any idea what the 18 means?

304
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,735
Uh-uh.

305
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:48,368
- Do you have a magnifying glass?
- Um, yep.

306
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,335
[crowd cheering]

307
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:08,889
[silo leader] Six minutes

308
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,141
and six seconds

309
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,477
past six o'clock

310
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:15,687
on this day

311
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:19,625
140 years ago.

312
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:24,296
That is the moment
we regained our freedom.

313
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:27,591
[crowd cheering]

314
00:23:27,616 --> 00:23:30,786
We are gathered on the anniversary

It's green out there. There's green trees.
There's blue skies.

478
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:33,270
[breathing heavily]
There's things flying in the air.

479
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:35,714
[breathing heavily]
Is no one listening to me?

480
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,983
They're keeping us here.

481
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:40,360
- This display is a lie.
- [Holston] Allison.

482
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:43,530
- Allison. Allison. Come with me.
- They... They want us to... No, no, no, no.

483
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:44,990
- Listen to me.
- [stammers] We tried...

484
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:48,285
- We tried three times. I know it's hard.
- I'm not crazy!

485
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:50,662
- Why are you treating me like I'm crazy?
- Of course not. Of course not.

486
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:53,582
Allison, I've known several patients
who have had breakdowns.

487
00:37:53,607 --> 00:37:55,959
I'm not having a breakdown.
[laughing, stammering]

488
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:57,211
[Holston] You are bleeding, honey.

489
00:37:57,236 --> 00:37:59,505
- And you need to come...
- No! [breathes shakily]

490
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:05,302
No. No. Just... I've been thinking
about this a lot, okay? [sniffles]

491
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:09,890
Please. [sighs] Just know
there's no other way.

492
00:38:09,915 --> 00:38:13,085
- [Holston breathes shakily]
- I'm sorry, honey.

493
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:15,879
It's... It's okay.

494
00:38:16,588 --> 00:38:18,440
- It's okay.
- [breathing heavily] I want to go out!

495
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:20,050
[people gasping]

496
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:25,138
[crying]

497
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:31,770
I want to go out. [sighs]

498
00:38:32,437 --> 00:38:33,438
Oh, God.

499
00:38:44,616 --> 00:38:46,343
[crying, breathing heavily]

500
00:38:46,368 --> 00:38:49,079
[handcuffs clicking]

501
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,385
- [Allison crying]
- [Holston exhales heavily]

502
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,740
- [silo leader] There has to be something.
- [Marnes] There isn't.

503
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:12,953
We could say she was distressed
or that she misspoke or people misheard.

504
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:16,957
[groans] There were people there.
They heard what they heard.

505
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:19,459
- Maybe we could...
- We can bribe them, kill them.

506
00:39:19,484 --> 00:39:20,652
No, goddamn it.

507
00:39:21,904 --> 00:39:26,008
The Pact says you can request a hearing
if you feel you have been misheard.

508
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:28,035
Allison does not feel she was misheard.

509
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:30,846
Don't you want to at least
look at the possibility?

510
00:39:30,871 --> 00:39:32,414
Of course I do!

511
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:37,252
Don't you think I've gone over it again
and again? There is nothing I can do.

512
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:46,136
[inhales deeply] If you boil the Pact
down to one rule,

513
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:51,475
it's do not say you want to go outside
or you will fucking go outside.

514
00:39:57,272 --> 00:40:01,960
[silo leader] Did anyone else play a part
in this? Steer her in this direction?

515
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:07,382
She talked to a fertility counselor on 17.
Gloria Hildebrandt.

516
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:08,967
And what did she say?

517
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:10,928
She admits she put the bug
in Allison's ear

518
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:14,056
about us not being the kind
they want having kids.

519
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:15,224
[silo leader] <i>Who's "they?"</i>

520
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:16,391
[Holston] <i>She doesn't know.</i>

521
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:19,436
<i>She's just mad
she and her husband couldn't have kids.</i>

522
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:21,063
Do your talking at the station.

523
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:25,275
[Marnes] <i>We also hauled up the guy
from the marketplace, George Wilkins.</i>

524
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,486
<i>He runs a computer repair stall.</i>

525
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:30,280
<i>Allison gave him tech support
on the holiday.</i>

526
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:35,744
She went shopping yesterday.
I thought maybe she'd gone to see him.

527
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:38,522
[Marnes] <i>But Wilkins said
that Allison never came back.</i>

528
00:40:39,231 --> 00:40:43,861
<i>A Judicial team searched his stall,
but they didn't find anything.</i>

529
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:46,446
[silo leader] <i>Then why?</i>

530
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,118
Allison feels things strongly.

531
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:55,163
But not being able to have a baby...

532
00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:01,461
I think it was just too much.

533
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,359
[inhales deeply]

534
00:41:07,384 --> 00:41:11,388
Holston, you don't have
to be here for the rest.

535
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:13,782
I'm the sheriff.

536
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,434
Sure you don't want to step aside?

537
00:41:16,393 --> 00:41:19,329
- I took an oath when I took the job.
- I know, but everyone will...

538
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:22,858
What's the value of swearing an oath
if you only stick to it when it's easy?

539
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:25,944
[sighs]

540
00:41:28,864 --> 00:41:30,904
[silo leader]
Two-day holiday, except for essential.

541
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:34,303
Open rooms Up Top for visitors.

542
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:38,849
We expect this'll attract a larger crowd
than usual, as it's been a while.

543
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:42,336
[voice fading] We'll hold a lottery
for attendance in the cafeteria.

544
00:42:00,395 --> 00:42:01,647
[Allison] I'm so sorry.

545
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:05,234
Me too.

546
00:42:09,446 --> 00:42:10,923
[Allison] I didn't go all crazy.

547
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:13,242
You cut something out of your body
with a knife.

548
00:42:13,784 --> 00:42:17,579
Yeah, and it hurt like hell. [chuckles]

549
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:22,309
I took the capsule back to Dr. Leonard.

550
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:23,769
[Allison] Oh, yeah? What'd he say?

551
00:42:23,794 --> 00:42:27,856
It was in there to hold a spot,
prevent infection.

552
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,132
Something like that, right?

553
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:35,639
Doesn't matter.

554
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:42,020
[sighs] I have to tell you something.
[sniffs]

555
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:44,773
But I need you to sit close.

556
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,668
- I don't want anybody to hear.
- We're alone.

557
00:42:47,693 --> 00:42:49,278
[sighs] Please.

558
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,322
Please.

559
00:43:00,998 --> 00:43:02,040
[sniffles]

560
00:43:03,625 --> 00:43:06,895
[inhales sharply]
First of all, I love you.

561
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:12,467
- That is the most important thing.
- Is it?

562
00:43:13,051 --> 00:43:16,180
I know you're angry. I would be too.

563
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:24,163
If I could wind back the clock
and not know what I know, I would.

564
00:43:24,188 --> 00:43:26,398
Ugh. In a heartbeat.

565
00:43:29,484 --> 00:43:33,739
But what I found out,
what they told us isn't true.

566
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:38,468
Why we're here,
what happened 140 years ago,

567
00:43:38,493 --> 00:43:41,597
why and who gets to have children.
And that's not even the big thing...

568
00:43:41,622 --> 00:43:42,706
So?

569
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:45,309
- So?
- You find out something like that,

570
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:49,271
you bring it to me, to Mayor Jahns,
to Judicial.

571
00:43:49,296 --> 00:43:50,856
You let everyone in the Silo know.

572
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:55,277
What you don't do is say the words
that get you sent out there to die.

573
00:43:55,302 --> 00:44:00,115
But that's the big thing I found out.
I won't die out there.

574
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:06,079
Listen, they have the ability
to change what we see on the screens.

575
00:44:06,104 --> 00:44:08,499
In the cafeteria,
throughout the Silo, everywhere.

576
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:10,626
- What are you talking about?
- They take an image,

577
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:12,544
and... and they alter it somehow.

578
00:44:12,569 --> 00:44:16,840
So, what we see is not what's out there.

579
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:19,760
It's what they want us
to think is out there.

580
00:44:19,785 --> 00:44:22,012
- What's that? Right there.
- [sighs] Holston.

581
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:23,305
- And that.
- [Allison sniffles]

582
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,557
[Holston]
The last three people who cleaned.

583
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:28,377
Or maybe that's not what it is.

584
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:32,314
- What if it's just rocks and bushes?
- I know what I'm seeing.

585
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:35,359
Not if it's just
what the computer wants you to see.

586
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:37,886
- Why would they do that?
- To keep us in here.

587
00:44:39,221 --> 00:44:40,305
Okay, okay.

588
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,686
If it's so wonderful outside,
why would they not want us to go out?

589
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:47,563
I don't know.

590
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,376
- I don't know.
- O... Okay.

591
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:55,212
But I'm gonna find out. I'm sorry. [sighs]

592
00:44:55,237 --> 00:44:56,880
- You keep saying that. I... I...
- Okay.

593
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:59,007
Just one more thing
I want you to think about,

594
00:44:59,032 --> 00:45:00,300
and then you should get some sleep.

595
00:45:00,325 --> 00:45:03,929
- [sighs, cries] Not going anywhere.
- [sighs]

596
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:07,958
[breathes heavily]
Why do people clean? [sniffles]

597
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:11,086
[breathes heavily]

598
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:14,898
To get the dust and grime
off the sensors

599
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:16,275
- so we can see.
- No. No.

600
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,360
Why do they go through with it?

601
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:20,154
Most people swear they're not gonna do it.

602
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:23,115
When you arrested Brent, he said you'd
have to put a bullet through his head

603
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,576
and throw him down the stairs
'cause he wasn't gonna clean.

604
00:45:25,601 --> 00:45:28,829
- And then what did he do?
- He cleaned.

605
00:45:28,854 --> 00:45:32,566
I think people clean
because they hope somehow

606
00:45:33,317 --> 00:45:38,572
that they can show people the truth
that that is a lie.

607
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:47,164
When I get out there, if that's what
it's really like, I won't clean.

608
00:45:48,665 --> 00:45:51,665
I'll wave goodbye, because I would have
made the biggest mistake of my life.

609
00:45:52,628 --> 00:45:54,713
- But if I'm right...
- [breathes deeply]

610
00:45:55,255 --> 00:45:57,983
...and it's green and lush and beautiful,

611
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:03,597
I'll pull out my wool
and I'll start to clean. And you'll know.

612
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:10,537
And then I'll walk over the hill,
and I'll find out what's going on.

613
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:12,356
And then I'll come back for you.

614
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:17,027
Okay?

615
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,256
[Jahns] "Allison Becker.

616
00:46:38,799 --> 00:46:42,611
You have been charged with
and convicted of violating

617
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:45,305
the cardinal law of our society.

618
00:46:46,181 --> 00:46:48,892
Any spoken request
to leave the Silo is granted,

619
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:52,563
but it is irrevocable.

620
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:58,402
Once uttered, it is determinative.

621
00:47:01,446 --> 00:47:03,115
You have been asked to clean

622
00:47:03,615 --> 00:47:06,410
and have been provided
with materials to do so.

623
00:47:07,244 --> 00:47:09,721
But you cannot be forced into cleaning.

624
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:14,209
Once outside the air lock,
you are outside the law."

625
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:26,054
[sniffs]

626
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:29,391
"We do not know why we are here.

627
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:34,479
We do not know who built the Silo.

628
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:40,360
We do not know why everything
outside the Silo is as it is.

629
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:46,158
We do not know...

630
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:51,538
when it will be safe to go outside.

631
00:47:53,665 --> 00:47:55,918
We only know that day is not today.

632
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:59,379
[cries] Allison Becker.

633
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:06,637
On behalf of the people of the Silo,
I hope that you will clean

634
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:12,868
so that we will better see
the world outside our sanctuary as it is

635
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:15,062
and thereby be reminded

636
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:20,567
that here is safe and there is not."

637
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:23,362
[sighs]

638
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:26,365
[Holston] Have you any last words?

639
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:30,744
[breathes deeply] I love you.

640
00:48:34,289 --> 00:48:35,499
I love you.

641
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,654
[door thuds]

642
00:49:55,204 --> 00:49:57,206
[air hissing]

643
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:45,254
[crowd murmuring]

644
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:48,400
[crowd cheering]

645
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:53,280
[crowd whistling, cheering]

646
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:48,043
[crowd murmuring]

647
00:52:57,761 --> 00:53:00,239
[crowd cheering]

648
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:01,348
Yes!

649
00:54:36,652 --> 00:54:38,237
[Marnes] Something you should see.

650
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:42,216
George Wilkins, he's the one Allison
went to help in the marketplace.

651
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:44,343
- We hauled him up and...
- Yeah, I know who he is.

652
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:47,204
He got a transfer to Mechanical last year.

653
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:49,456
Okay.

654
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:56,563
He's dead. Went over the rail
somewhere around level 120.

655
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:59,091
Accident? Suicide?

656
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:00,968
I don't know.

657
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:05,072
- What does Hank say?
- Eh. He didn't say much.

658
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:06,723
No one saw him go over.

659
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:10,394
Get to the part you're not telling me.

660
00:55:11,395 --> 00:55:12,479
[sighs]

661
00:55:13,981 --> 00:55:16,692
There's an engineer down there
that says it's murder.

662
00:55:37,212 --> 00:55:38,755
[Marnes] Where's the engineer?

663
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:40,924
Uh, she couldn't make it.

664
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:45,053
It took us a day to walk down here.
She could have cleared her schedule.

665
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:46,722
Something came up.

666
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:53,687
Okay.

667
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:03,338
Meeting with us isn't optional, Hank.

668
00:56:03,363 --> 00:56:06,425
She says this guy was murdered.
We need to speak to her.

669
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,534
What came up?

670
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:11,246
The generator. It's been giving her fits.

671
00:56:13,165 --> 00:56:14,224
What does she do?

672
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:16,752
Well, she pretty much keeps everyone
in the Silo alive.

673
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:27,137
[mechanical whirring, scraping]

674
00:56:41,026 --> 00:56:42,027
[shouting] That's her.

675
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:44,885
- [shouting] What's her name?
- What?

676
00:56:45,614 --> 00:56:47,132
[shouting] What's her name?

677
00:56:47,157 --> 00:56:49,952
Juliette. Juliette Nichols.

678
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:15,602
[Marnes] <i>What happened
between you and her?</i>

679
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,858
<i>For two years, you were dead inside.</i>

680
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:25,529
<i>Then you met Juliette Nichols.</i>

681
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:30,909
- I finally started listening is all.
- To what?

682
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:36,123
To Allison.
To what she was trying to tell me.

683
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:39,309
I'm not gonna tell you what that was.

684
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:43,630
All you need to know is,
I'm gonna go find her.

685
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:46,341
You want to find her?

686
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:49,178
She's right there.

687
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:53,182
I'm sorry.

688
00:57:55,767 --> 00:57:58,228
As much as I love you, you old bastard,

689
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,481
I love Allison more.

690
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:10,616
If that really is her out there or not,

691
00:58:11,783 --> 00:58:13,577
either way, I'm done.

692
00:58:14,703 --> 00:58:16,622
I've gotta know the truth.
