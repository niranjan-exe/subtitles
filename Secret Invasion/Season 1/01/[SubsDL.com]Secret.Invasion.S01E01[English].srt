Maybe we postpone the strike.

To the contrary.

00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:00,875
I understand. You're taking a risk.

495

A risk?

496
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:07,041
Is that what you explained to Mum,
that following you could get her killed?

Your mother died
while you were working for her killer.
