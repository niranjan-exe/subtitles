Mr. Nicholas Fury and Miss Maria Hill,

About 15 years ago,

I was part of an eyes-only,

It was about
a shape-shifting alien species

that had sent a few of its light ships

that they might get into their heads

Oh. I'm sorry.

457
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,583

to a word that I've said?

Yeah, I have. The world is on the line.

more dangerous than HYDRA,

And you want me to make the power
mean something by helpin' a brother out.

464
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:17,166
But you should know better than most.

465
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:21,916
The reason we wrestled this power
from mediocre men who don't look like us

466
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,208
was not simply to turn around
and hand it to mediocre men who do.

467
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:28,500
The point of this power
is to be uncompromising,

468
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:30,250
to be unsparing,

469
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:33,541
to be able to sit across
from a man we greatly admire,

470

with whom we share an entire professional,
personal, ancestral history with

471
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:42,291
and to tell him without any reservation,
that he's fired.
