1
00:00:50,172 --> 00:00:52,412
Gentlemen, when I look
at this battlefield,

2
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:55,343
I see some of the
bravest men who have ever worn a uniform.

3
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:56,585
Is that you, Johnson?

4
00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:58,466
You are a real
lazy piece of shit.

5
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,723
Johnson, right!

6
00:01:00,724 --> 00:01:02,447
Sorry sir.
Just guarding the tank.

7
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:03,757
You were Sleeping.
I heard you.

8
00:01:03,758 --> 00:01:06,067
But it's so comfortable here.

9
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:07,723
me, huh...

10
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:09,792
what drug

11
00:01:09,793 --> 00:01:11,378
And you, stop posing.

12
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:12,379
- Sorry sir.
- Sorry sir.

13
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,895
Damn showboats.

14
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:15,343
Excuse me, dear captain.

15
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:16,930
What you want?

16
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:18,240
Can I get some cigarettes?

17
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,136
- No.
- How about a rifle?

18
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:21,516
You are a prisoner of war.

19
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:23,412
That doesn't mean we
can still be friends.

20
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:25,723
- Not really.
- Really?

21
00:01:25,724 --> 00:01:27,895
I had never heard that.
How about a horn?

22
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:29,723
We already have a guy
who plays the horn.

23
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:31,792
I can definitely
play better than he can.

24
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:33,067
It is true. I'm bad.

25
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:34,723
I won't give you a bugle.

26
00:01:34,724 --> 00:01:37,136
If I had my way, I would kill
every German in this place.

27
00:01:37,137 --> 00:01:39,931
But you've already killed all
the Germans in this place.

28
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:45,274
I would do it again in a
heartbeat, so don't test me.

29
00:01:45,275 --> 00:01:47,378
There. It's very cruel
to threaten someone

30
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,826
with a
war crime, my friend.

31
00:01:48,827 --> 00:01:50,067
We are not friends...

32
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,619
Sir, I see something there.

33
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,412
What was it? Where is Johnson?

34
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,274
Yeehaw.

35
00:01:55,275 --> 00:01:57,586
Johnson, you imbecile!
Everyone run!

36
00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:23,827
This is the "Video Journal
of Neurosurgery" with...

37
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,274
Guys, I said
the list is endless.

38
00:02:28,275 --> 00:02:29,619
So why wait?

39

78
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,516
Let me take a picture of this
beautiful piece of meat right here.

79
00:04:29,517 --> 00:04:31,688

- It looks good on you.

Why do you look
hotter than Rachel?

- Who wore it best?
- That's what I'm saying.

82
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:35,964
Poor Rachel.

83
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:37,240
Don't even make that comparison.

84
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:38,931
I'm fine as fuck, man.

85
00:04:41,103 --> 00:04:44,171
Listen, this is a
very special episode, because

86
00:04:44,172 --> 00:04:46,067
tonight, RACK
is going on a mission.

87
00:04:46,068 --> 00:04:47,723
We're invading the Colony!

88
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:49,999
Don't use that word, idiot.
What is wrong with you?

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,585
We are visiting Cologne.

90
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:54,792
The infamous Underground Colony.

91
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:56,723
Why do you have to keep
acting so effeminate lately?

92
00:04:56,724 --> 00:04:58,103
It's you and what, Mohammed?

93
00:04:59,586 --> 00:05:01,723
Anyone who, for
those of you born yesterday,

94
00:05:01,724 --> 00:05:03,999
The Colony Underground
was very perverse like that...

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,516
It was an art collective.

96
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:07,171
"Was it an artist collective?"

97
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:11,240
So this art collective
had shows all the time.

98
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,378
It was for all
ages, and some bands

99
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,757
big ones came
from the city, like the KGB,

100
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:20,585
Eddie Cash e os Star
Fuckers, Valentine Fox,

101
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,654
- mostly pumped hardcore stuff.
- Yea.

102
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,412
We would totally
have played there.

103
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:26,309
- Yea.
- Certainly.

104
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,861
- Serious.
- We would have if it wasn't

105
00:05:27,862 --> 00:05:29,412
by the strange fire

106
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,378
electric that
happened three years ago.

107
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:36,136
- Wait, is this really serious?
- Yes, March 6, 1996.

108
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,343
It's March 5th.

109
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:39,206
Can you let him talk? God!

110
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:46,171
Three years ago, a
strange electrical fire

111
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:48,481
fritou o interior do
The Colony Underground

112
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:52,792
and claimed four innocent lives.

113
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:57,723
The life of the band
that played that night.

114
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,550
Legend says that their bodies
were only burned after

115
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:04,309
of being trampled to
death by their own fans.

116
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:08,136
Fans so desperate
to escape the flames

117
00:06:08,137 --> 00:06:12,240
who crushed their heroes
without a second thought.

118
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:13,481
Honey, go on.

119
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:14,999
Hum?

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,378
Oh, yes, yes, see how
scared Ankur looks.

121
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,757
Shut up, I'm fine.

122
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,171
Oh, your left pocket.

123
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,378
Ankur is a little bitch?
Let's see, let's see.

124
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:26,516
Hey, it's spinning! It's spinning.

125

I swear to God, look, look, look!

Ok, ok, ok.

127
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:34,792
So that band was Bitch Cat.

128
00:06:34,793 --> 00:06:36,688
Can you put some things
from the tape you have in there?

129
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,688
- Yea.
- It would be a nice edit.

Everyone's father got very rich.

164
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:30,619
Yeah, so give us all
your damn money, Daddy.

165
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,067
Give us your money!

Play or die.

170
00:08:58,862 --> 00:09:00,724
Play or die.

171
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:02,619
Play or die.

172
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,447
Play or die!

173
00:09:06,448 --> 00:09:08,792
Oh my God, look how
angry he is.

174
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:11,550
Hey! Quickly! Come on! Come on.

175
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,792
Hey, wait, wait.

176
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:15,619
Tell everyone about
today's mission.

177
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,550
RACK is heading to
The Colony Underground

178
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:19,240
to do a show about
what's left on that stage.

179
00:09:19,241 --> 00:09:20,964
And we're gonna suck because

180
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:22,516
we're rehearsing,
what, two months?

181
00:09:22,517 --> 00:09:23,757
Yes, show yourself to
your Nazi dictator father.

182
00:09:23,758 --> 00:09:25,861
- I hope it's...
- Oh my God, whatever.

183
00:09:25,862 --> 00:09:27,585
No, wait, come on.
Like, what else?

184
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:29,343
- What else?
- I don't know.

185
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:31,481
Let's get the equipment,
if there's any that work.

186
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:34,240
Yes, but why did you
stop here? It's your house?

187
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,654
- Come on, K.
- Hey, no.

188
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:37,792
I just think
curious minds want to know if

189
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:41,136
you're really just
scared, little bitch.

190
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:43,723
That's all I want to know!
Come on!

191
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:46,861
Hey, I'm sorry. I
meant a little baby

192
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:49,136
scared that he thinks he
's going to meet some ghosts.

193
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:53,550
Hey Rachel, get the camera.
Get the fucking camera, Rachel.

194
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,378
Why is Ankur
being such a bitch now?

195
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:56,757
It seems

196
00:09:56,758 --> 00:09:58,240
You want your mama because
you don't come home.

197
00:09:58,241 --> 00:09:59,619
Stay away from me!

198
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,068
Oh no! The ghost ladies
will eat me.

199
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,792
Man, I can't believe
we're here now.

200
00:10:07,793 --> 00:10:09,585
Come on, it's gonna be fun.
C'mon C'mon.

201
00:10:09,586 --> 00:10:11,343
Rach, these girls
seem kind.

202
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,067
I just don't think we should
fuck up their graves.

203
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:14,585
But, like, you have
to say why.

204
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:17,309
Come on, you'll make
a better video.

205
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,137
I think it will be cool.

206
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,999
OK everything is fine.

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,067
So, you know
these stories, okay?

208
00:10:24,068 --> 00:10:26,688
Hindu stories about bhuts.

209
00:10:26,689 --> 00:10:29,516
- Bhuts?
- Yes, dead people.

210
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:33,378
Restless spirits with
unfinished business, and supposedly

211
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:36,550
if you bother them they
won't like it, they'll just...

212
00:10:36,551 --> 00:10:37,930
They go what?

213
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:39,862
They'll own you, okay?

214
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:48,447
- Yea!
- We're in.

215
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:51,723
So, is that why you went home
and bought a bag of spices?

216
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:54,585
They are like spices
for killing ghosts.

217
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:55,792
Just stop, I don't want to...

218
00:10:55,793 --> 00:10:57,102
Relax, spice boy.

219
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:58,447
Stop bugging me,
you motherfucker.

220
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:01,309
Wow, calm your boobs, man.

221
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,620
He, he, wait.

222
00:11:05,758 --> 00:11:08,516
Welcome to what's left
of The Colony Underground.

223
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:10,964
Like, literally
below ground.

224
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:13,481
Yes, about six feet below.

225
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:15,136
It's insane that the whole audience

226
00:11:15,137 --> 00:11:16,585
got out of here alive.

227
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:19,205
Yeah, well, they sacrifice
the band to do that.

228
00:11:19,206 --> 00:11:22,585
Imagine dying in a stampede.

229
00:11:22,586 --> 00:11:25,033
Herd mentality, man.
sheep.

230
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:27,895
It still smells like fire here.

231
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,586
Crispy bodies.

232
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,930
Wow.

233
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:38,586
What is it?

234
00:11:39,896 --> 00:11:41,447
Rachel I don't...

235
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:44,827
Let's go. Just go.
We will. Hurry up.

236
00:11:52,655 --> 00:11:53,965
Boo!

237
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:58,136
This place is a total maze.

238
00:11:58,137 --> 00:12:01,654
So many runners.

239
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,102
We've
been down here for 10 minutes.

240
00:12:03,103 --> 00:12:04,481
I have no idea how to get back.

241
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:07,000
Keep cool. I know the way.

242
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,412
What is this?

243
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:12,931
Hell how am I supposed to know.

244
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:20,826
I think someone
lives down here.

245
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:23,688
Look look. Come here.

246
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:26,343
Look at this.

247
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:27,826
Why would anyone
want to live here?

248
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:30,482
Well, I mean, for a
homeless person, it's not that bad.

249
00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:35,309
- Yeah, I bet.
- Look at all the...

250
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,309
I bet we're not alone.

251
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:39,102
Dude, seriously.
It's just us here.

252
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:41,343
- I know it is.
- He's some drug addict,

253
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,654
a homeless man who
licks heroin here.

254
00:12:43,655 --> 00:12:45,033
Can you please stop?

255
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:46,689
Sorry.

256
00:12:48,758 --> 00:12:51,102
What are you doing?
Stop. Don't go in there.

257
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,585
- Let's go.
- Whooo.

258
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:53,895
Dude, seriously?

259
00:12:53,896 --> 00:12:55,274
Oh my God. Oh my God.

260
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,103
You are kidding.

261
00:12:57,965 --> 00:13:00,688
- Not really.
- Yeah, fuck it.

262
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:04,793
Anyway, look,
someone made a shrine.

263
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,895
- What did you think?
- Wow.

264
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:13,757
No way.

265
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:16,378
Hey, Kaleb, stop it.

266
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,309
Hey, that's not cool.

267
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,723
Stop, dear.

268
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:23,586
As you want bro.

269
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:31,033
Rachel, come here, come here.
Did you see that?

270
00:13:31,034 --> 00:13:34,309
Ew. Is that a boot?

271
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,586
Melted to the floor.

272
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:43,378
It should belong to one of the girls
in the band, don't you think?

273
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:44,757
Yeah, I bet my money
it was the bass player.

274
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:45,964
She wore boots like that.

275
00:13:45,965 --> 00:13:47,240
I'm sure they
all wore boots.

276
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:49,240
Stop saying that word.

277
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:51,447
Or what? Boots?

278
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:52,930
Hey Rach, come here,
you have to see this.

279
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,240
- Or what?
- Shit, no chance.

280
00:13:54,241 --> 00:13:55,757
No way.
Hey Rachel, come here.

281
00:13:55,758 --> 00:13:57,240
- Which? What is it?
- Okay, do you remember?

282
00:13:57,241 --> 00:13:59,205
- Amanda Pears, don't you remember?
- Yea.

283
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:00,447
Can you tell me
how could she

284
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:02,102
wait for fat bunda
dela here.

285
00:14:02,103 --> 00:14:03,550
- Dude, there's no way.
- There's no way!

286
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,378
Yes, that's what I'm saying.

287
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:08,033
Yes, no one likes to be
robbed after asking.

288
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:10,757
That's why she can no
longer work, except in the

289
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:12,136
gas station, because
she is very funny.

290
00:14:12,137 --> 00:14:14,826
Ah-ha-ha.

291
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:17,619
Cum! It felt like
someone pulled me.

292
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,585
Yeah, you tripped, man.

293
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:21,413
Guys, come quickly!

294
00:14:26,793 --> 00:14:27,930
No no no.

295
00:14:27,931 --> 00:14:29,619
Hey, did you do this?

296
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,826
No way.

297
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:35,067
Rachel, look at this.

298
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:37,205
- Did you guys do that?
- No.

299
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:38,654
No, Anchor.

300
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:39,757
Surprise, bitch!

301
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:42,343
You are awesome.

302
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:44,757
Do you really think some
ghost set this up here?

303
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,240
Not. Did you, like, steal
them from my house?

304
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:49,171
Yes, I did it.
What did you think of it all?

305
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:50,654
- Are you going to cry about it?
- You are unreal.

306
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,585
Big crybaby.

307
00:14:52,586 --> 00:14:54,895
All right, everybody try
not to fuck it up, okay?

308
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:56,757
- Oh, sure.
- You are the boss.

309
00:14:56,758 --> 00:14:59,447
- We will.
- Thanks.

310
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:01,931
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

311
00:15:04,931 --> 00:15:08,550
No no no!

312
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:09,862
Come on!

313
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,067
Guys?

314
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:18,792
Guys, what the fuck is this?

315
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:21,309
Guys, is this serious?

316
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,447
Guys, stop it.

317
00:15:23,448 --> 00:15:26,447
You think you're
having a lot of fun right now.

318
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:30,000
If this is a joke,
I will kill you all.

319
00:15:33,793 --> 00:15:37,309
Yes, let's go.

320
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:40,102
He's so predictable.

321
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:42,274
No, we like
you very much with all...

322
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,205
It's been like three times.

323
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:46,964
I know. Hey.

324
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,274
Tell people what you are...

325
00:15:48,275 --> 00:15:50,171
How are you feeling now?

326
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:51,758
Mr. Ankur, tell them here.

327
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:56,688
What?

328
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,205
Man, you have to admit
we got you so good.

329
00:15:58,206 --> 00:16:00,448
Man, it was fun as fuck, man.
Serious.

330
00:16:02,103 --> 00:16:04,688
Man, like, we're
just kidding.

331
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:07,000
- Look, it was my idea.
- We will.

332
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,654
- I'm sorry.
- Damn it.

333
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:16,379
Why can't you learn to take
a fucking joke, spice boy?

334
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:19,136
- Oh or what?
- Ankur.

335
00:16:19,137 --> 00:16:20,412
What are you
doing now, bro?

336
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,067
what the fuck?
What are you doing?

337
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:25,585
Don't be such a bitch
about it, Ankur! Come back!

338
00:16:25,586 --> 00:16:29,067
Hope the bhuta catches you all!

339
00:16:29,068 --> 00:16:31,102
- Ankur, come on.
- Drug. Or what?

340
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:33,171
What the hell is he talking about?

341
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:35,619
So, are we still going
to do the gelatin thing?

342
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,999
Four Bitch Cats.
Four sex dolls.

343
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,757
Welcome back, sick.

344
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:43,412
We came to
The Colony Underground

345
00:16:43,413 --> 00:16:47,481
to find a very scientific answer to the age-old question.

346
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:51,343
How hard is it to crush
four puppies to death?

347
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,171
Let's find out.

348
00:16:53,172 --> 00:16:55,171
Are you ready?

349
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:57,516
Die, bitch!

350
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,412
Oh!

351
00:16:59,413 --> 00:17:01,413
Oh, fuck you bitch.

352
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:04,241
Are we in trouble here?

353
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:10,827
Die, bitch!

354
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:18,551
He is going to screw it up! He is going to screw it up!

355
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:24,067
Did you hear this?

356
00:17:24,068 --> 00:17:26,895
Yes, it must be a car out there.

357
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:29,102
A estrada is dated, cara.

358
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:30,688
Jesus!

359
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:32,137
Ankur, is that you?

360
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:36,827
Get the fuck off my stage!

361
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:49,931
What the fuck?!

362
00:18:41,827 --> 00:18:44,102
Touch or die.

363
00:18:44,103 --> 00:18:45,965
Play or die.

364
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,862
Play or die.

365
00:18:47,931 --> 00:18:49,757
Play or die.

366
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:52,000
Play or die!

367
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,137
Shit. Oh shit, oh shit!

368
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:13,481
Please help! Help!

369
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:16,000
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!

370
00:20:19,068 --> 00:20:24,034
You can peacefully go to
your final resting place!

371
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:46,000
Psychopath dude, I'm going crazy.

372
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,171
Please help me!

373
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:56,861
Please!

374
00:20:56,862 --> 00:20:58,172
Please someone!

375
00:21:01,103 --> 00:21:03,067
Please!

376
00:21:03,068 --> 00:21:05,068
Stop it!

377
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,620
Help!

378
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:11,999
Anybody here?!

379
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,274
Better!

380
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:14,965
Stay away from me!

381
00:21:21,034 --> 00:21:23,620
Let me out! Let me out!

382
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,517
No!

383
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:35,757
No!

384
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:37,758
It seems!

385
00:22:27,655 --> 00:22:29,171
You can feel
it at the shows now.

386
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:32,550
Everyone is so angry.

387
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:34,471
What's a party without
a little violence?

388
00:22:37,931 --> 00:22:40,827
Let's fuck everything!

389
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,137
Too, too.

390
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:15,103
Hum.

391
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,586
There you are.

392
00:23:50,586 --> 00:23:52,517
Hello.

393
00:23:56,137 --> 00:23:59,792
Hey. Um, I just...

394
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:01,206
OK.

395
00:24:02,344 --> 00:24:03,344
Hey.

396
00:24:03,345 --> 00:24:05,102
I just had to record
this video after going to

397
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:09,102
Beta Sigma Eta today and
meet all the girls.

398
00:24:09,103 --> 00:24:10,826
No, it's bad.

399
00:24:10,827 --> 00:24:12,619
It's broken. OKAY.

400
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,689
OK.

401
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:18,447
I just want
you to know that since the

402
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:20,033
moment I
joined Beta Sigma Eta

403
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:22,136
I knew it was my home.

404
00:24:22,137 --> 00:24:24,067
I want you to be
my friends for life

405
00:24:24,068 --> 00:24:27,654
whole, and I will not
apply for more fellowships.

406
00:24:27,655 --> 00:24:29,343
I knew from the
moment you

407
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,447
I knew that we
would become soul sisters.

408
00:24:31,448 --> 00:24:34,171
- A suicide attempt?
- Helen?

409
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:36,999
I thought you were
studying at the library.

410
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,516
You are only putting one
fellowship in your application.

411
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:42,067
- A suicide attempt.
- Yes, I know what

412
00:24:42,068 --> 00:24:43,068
a suicide attempt is, Helen.

413
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:44,688
I am not stupid.

414
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:46,274
And?

415
00:24:46,275 --> 00:24:47,999
Well then, if they
say no, you will be

416
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,205
excluded from the entire
fellowship process.

417
00:24:51,206 --> 00:24:53,585
And that means spending all

418
00:24:53,586 --> 00:24:55,067
his freshman year
as an outcast.

419
00:24:55,068 --> 00:24:58,412
Do you really want to take
that risk with those girls?

420
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:01,172
What do you mean
by those girls?

421
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,826
I mean, have you
seen the way they

422
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:08,792
did they look at us when they
showed us the place?

423
00:25:08,793 --> 00:25:10,171
I mean do you
really think that

424
00:25:10,172 --> 00:25:12,723
Will they say yes
to people like us?

425
00:25:12,724 --> 00:25:15,379
No, not us.

426
00:25:18,275 --> 00:25:20,103
Do you have a cigarette?

427
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,068
I can not do it.

428
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:29,723
Jesus Christ, Annie.

429
00:25:29,724 --> 00:25:32,412
You will bring the security here.

430
00:25:32,413 --> 00:25:33,688
Why did you take so long?

431
00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:35,378
Do not roll up your panties.

432
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:36,861
- We had to get some supplies.
- Oh my God.

433
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:39,171
It turns out that Lily here
really likes to party.

434
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:41,723
Oh, let's party.

435
00:25:41,724 --> 00:25:43,619
Guys, do you understand?

436
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,688
Do you have the keys?

437
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:46,619
My father will
kill me if he finds out.

438
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,895
Yes, but do you have the keys?

439
00:25:48,896 --> 00:25:50,586
You know I have.

440
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:53,240
Come on, let's go!

441
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:55,895
Come on, it's time.

442
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:58,033
Oi, Lindsay.

443
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,241
- Oh shit.
- Oh my God.

444
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,930
We're going to have a fun night.

445
00:26:03,931 --> 00:26:07,999
- Oh my God.
- College Scholarship.

446
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,654
Isn't she cute?

447
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:12,619
Welcome!

448
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,586
Oh my God,
this place is amazing.

449
00:26:19,241 --> 00:26:22,378
Pretty cool, huh?

450
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:24,895
Dude, we love your message.

451
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,274
It was so sincere.

452
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:28,895
Wasn't it girls?

453
00:26:28,896 --> 00:26:31,240
- So cute.
- Adorable.

454
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:33,309
We were so flattered
that you gave it a try.

455
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,481
of suicide just to
join our brotherhood.

456
00:26:35,482 --> 00:26:38,033
Yes, friends forever.

457
00:26:38,034 --> 00:26:39,412
Yes, soul sisters.

458
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:41,931
- Soul sisters!
- Soul sisters!

459
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:46,586
So what are we doing here?

460
00:26:49,862 --> 00:26:52,482
Have you heard of the
Legend of Guiltine?

461
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:58,274
Guiltine, was a
very young freshman

462
00:26:58,275 --> 00:27:00,585
who went to TCU
maybe 20 years ago.

463
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:06,171
She wanted to join a
sisterhood, our sisterhood like you.

464
00:27:06,172 --> 00:27:09,585
And she was desperate
and alone, just like you.

465
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,688
And the girls took her
back here to the cemetery.

466
00:27:12,689 --> 00:27:15,723
And they told her that to
be part of their sisterhood,

467
00:27:15,724 --> 00:27:18,999
she had to spend the night
buried in a coffin.

468
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,171
Only they didn't
leave her there for one night.

469
00:27:22,172 --> 00:27:24,619
They left her there
for a whole week.

470
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:27,343
And when they finally
dug her up...

471
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:29,206
There was no one there.

472
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,654
What happened to her?

473
00:27:32,655 --> 00:27:34,171
Nobody knows.

474
00:27:34,172 --> 00:27:38,895
Some say she just
crawled straight to the underworld.

475
00:27:38,896 --> 00:27:40,826
And if you listen carefully, at

476
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:43,481
sometimes you may
hear a tapping sound.

477
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:47,378
It's Guiltine,
desperate and alone.

478
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:49,447
Looking for someone
awake that she can

479
00:27:49,448 --> 00:27:51,008
take to the underworld to play.

480
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,171
Drink!

481
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,206
Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily!

482
00:28:01,551 --> 00:28:03,379
We have something for you.

483
00:28:05,689 --> 00:28:06,826
Surprise, bitch.

484
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:09,309
Do not play!

485
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,171
We want you to join our family.
Right, girls?

486
00:28:12,172 --> 00:28:14,688
We just need you
to do one thing first.

487
00:28:14,689 --> 00:28:15,895
Thanks. OK.

488
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:19,309
A tiny thing.

489
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,136
We need you
to spend the night in a coffin.

490
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:24,655
Just like Guiltine.

491
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:29,240
Come on!

492
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,964
You will have
fun, I promise.

493
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:32,171
OK.

494
00:28:32,172 --> 00:28:33,572
You will be a little scared.

495
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:37,551
Oh.

496
00:28:42,724 --> 00:28:45,067
Um, Annie, I don't know if I'm
really wanting to do this.

497
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:47,378
Oh come on Lily.

498
00:28:47,379 --> 00:28:49,309
We all had to do this.

499
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,792
Did you... have all of you done this?

500
00:28:52,793 --> 00:28:56,274
Of course.

501
00:28:56,275 --> 00:28:58,309
It really isn't that bad.

502
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,895
- I promise.
- OK.

503
00:28:59,896 --> 00:29:02,516
There is enough air in a
coffin to last 24 hours.

504
00:29:02,517 --> 00:29:04,240
The faster
you breathe, the faster

505
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:06,034
you use your air
not to panic.

506
00:29:07,724 --> 00:29:11,309
You can pull this cord at any
time, and it will ring the bell.

507
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,274
And we're going to dig it up.

508
00:29:13,275 --> 00:29:15,481
But if you do, you will have lost the

509
00:29:15,482 --> 00:29:17,930
your place in our fellowship.

510
00:29:17,931 --> 00:29:20,067
Here it is.

511
00:29:20,068 --> 00:29:22,274
We want to see how
scared you are.

512
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:24,241
And so, you can see down there.

513
00:29:26,068 --> 00:29:28,171
Just be brave.

514
00:29:28,172 --> 00:29:29,999
It really isn't that bad.

515
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,137
Annie probably won't
let you stay there all night.

516
00:29:38,965 --> 00:29:40,240
Take it.

517
00:29:40,241 --> 00:29:42,792
Only open when you have more

518
00:29:42,793 --> 00:29:44,585
scared and about to pull the string.

519
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:47,516
It will give you strength. I promise.

520
00:29:47,517 --> 00:29:49,068
Thanks.

521
00:29:51,241 --> 00:29:53,171
Watch out for the Guild.

522
00:29:53,172 --> 00:29:55,412
If you hear her knock,
whatever you do, no

523
00:29:55,413 --> 00:29:57,067
let her know
you're down there.

524
00:29:57,068 --> 00:29:58,792
If you let her know
you're alive, she'll

525
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:02,585
will take you to the world of the
dead to play.

526
00:30:02,586 --> 00:30:04,137
She's just playing with you.

527
00:30:10,931 --> 00:30:18,378
B-S-E, B-S-E, B-S-E, B-S-E!

528
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:21,895
Good luck down there.
Don't be too scared.

529
00:30:21,896 --> 00:30:23,792
Oh, it's cute and cozy.

530
00:30:23,793 --> 00:30:25,068
Last words?

531
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:28,931
Very good.

532
00:30:30,275 --> 00:30:35,723
Lily! Lily!
Lily! Lily! Lily!

533
00:30:35,724 --> 00:30:40,586
Lily! Lily! Lily!
Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily!

534
00:30:41,793 --> 00:30:42,965
Wow!

535
00:30:44,172 --> 00:30:46,826
Ah, terra, terra.

536
00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:49,274
Ah, damp earth.

537
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:53,895
You took my father
and my dear mother.

538
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:58,654
You took my father and
my dear mother, so

539
00:30:58,655 --> 00:31:05,068
take me too because
I'm very alone.

540
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:13,103
Goodnight.

541
00:31:45,172 --> 00:31:47,171
He is well.

542
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:49,688
It's okay, just don't panic.

543
00:31:49,689 --> 00:31:51,137
Do not panic.

544
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,343
Everything is fine.

545
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,826
It's all just for show.

546
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:14,274
They won't
let you down here.

547
00:32:14,275 --> 00:32:16,344
Come on, you knew
they were going to do this.

548
00:32:18,827 --> 00:32:20,688
I'm not scared.

549
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,310
I'm not scared.

550
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:23,758
I'm not scared.

551
00:32:41,655 --> 00:32:44,172
Oh Helen, if only you
could see me now.

552
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:55,585
What did you do this weekend?

553
00:32:55,586 --> 00:32:59,309
Library?
Oh, that's cool. I?

554
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,689
Oh, you know, the usual,
just buried alive in a coffin.

555
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:28,895
No, that's what
you want, isn't it?

556
00:33:28,896 --> 00:33:32,343
You want me to fail so
I can end up like you.

557
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,205
Sad and lonely every
Friday night wishing for a

558
00:33:35,206 --> 00:33:39,033
boy, any boy
would ask you out.

559
00:33:39,034 --> 00:33:41,723
But I'm not like you.

560
00:33:41,724 --> 00:33:43,310
I'm like them.

561
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:51,412
He is well.

562
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:53,344
It's gonna be okay.

563
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:04,516
Hello?

564
00:34:04,517 --> 00:34:06,379
Hello? Hello?

565
00:34:09,034 --> 00:34:10,482
Hello?

566
00:34:24,758 --> 00:34:28,241
She is probably very scared.

567
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,172
The box, the box.

568
00:34:55,862 --> 00:34:57,551
what shit?

569
00:35:00,827 --> 00:35:02,861
Oh, poor baby.

570
00:35:02,862 --> 00:35:04,482
Poor Lily.

571
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:25,274
Let me out!
Let me out! Let me out!

572
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:27,447
Oh my God.

573
00:35:27,448 --> 00:35:29,172
She is definitely shit.

574
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:39,792
- Let me out!
- Let me out!

575
00:35:39,793 --> 00:35:41,517
Let me out!

576
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:07,343
Hit or else.

577
00:36:07,344 --> 00:36:09,136
If they find out we
're making a

578
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:10,412
prank prank,
we'll all be expelled.

579
00:36:10,413 --> 00:36:11,930
Cum! My father will kill me!

580
00:36:11,931 --> 00:36:13,412
Nobody will be expelled.

581
00:36:13,413 --> 00:36:14,999
Let's hide and
come back later.

582
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,205
Mas e a Lily?

583
00:36:16,206 --> 00:36:18,136
I said we'll be back later.

584
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:19,551
Come on.

585
00:36:33,448 --> 00:36:36,033
<i>Hey, dispatch for
1061 no cemetery,</i>

586
00:36:36,034 --> 00:36:38,551
<i>Answer us by updating.</i>

587
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:43,826
Fuck this.

588
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:46,517
Let's go back inside
before we hit pneumonia.

589
00:36:48,758 --> 00:36:50,585
Help!

590
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,274
I need help!

591
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:54,757
Let me out! Let me out!

592
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:56,103
Let me out!

593
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,274
Let me out!

594
00:36:58,275 --> 00:37:01,205
Let me out! Please!

595
00:37:01,206 --> 00:37:02,862
Please someone!

596
00:37:19,896 --> 00:37:23,240
Helen, if you've seen this,

597
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:27,067
I just want you to know
that I'm really sorry.

598
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:30,343
I was such an idiot.

599
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:32,930
You are my best friend.

600
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:37,033
You are my only real friend.

601
00:37:37,034 --> 00:37:40,757
I don't know why I thought I could
fit in with those girls.

602
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,103
I don't know why
I even wanted to.

603
00:38:05,793 --> 00:38:07,310
Oh my God.

604
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,930
No! No!

605
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:16,205
No! No! Let me out!

606
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:18,379
Let me out!

607
00:38:30,551 --> 00:38:32,654
No! Help-me!

608
00:38:32,655 --> 00:38:34,688
Let me out!

609
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:35,757
Oh my God!

610
00:38:35,758 --> 00:38:38,757
No! No! No!

611
00:38:38,758 --> 00:38:41,309
Please! No!

612
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:45,550
Please help me!

613
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:47,758
Please help!

614
00:38:50,655 --> 00:38:52,550
No!

615
00:38:52,551 --> 00:38:54,448
Help!

616
00:39:12,103 --> 00:39:14,861
Oh my God!

617
00:39:14,862 --> 00:39:16,412
Annie?

618
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:18,205
Annie, let me out!
Let me out!

619
00:39:18,206 --> 00:39:19,551
Let me out!

620
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,034
Let me out!

621
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:51,827
Oh my God!

622
00:40:46,482 --> 00:40:48,586
I will be sick.

623
00:40:49,724 --> 00:40:51,619
Are you filming now?

624
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,930
We have to throw it out.

625
00:40:52,931 --> 00:40:54,792
It is too late.

626
00:40:54,793 --> 00:40:56,000
Imogen, no.

627
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:09,033
He's empty.

628
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:10,482
What are you talking about?

629
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,378
The coffin is empty.

630
00:41:15,379 --> 00:41:17,757
Lily is not in.

631
00:41:17,758 --> 00:41:19,482
That's not possible.

632
00:41:37,344 --> 00:41:40,136
- What if Guiltine took her?
- Don't be stupid.

633
00:41:40,137 --> 00:41:42,172
Guiltine is just a story.

634
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,412
We were never here, okay?

635
00:41:49,413 --> 00:41:52,067
We'll never talk about it again.

636
00:41:52,068 --> 00:41:53,586
understand?

637
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,723
Hello?

638
00:42:48,724 --> 00:42:50,068
Hello?!

639
00:43:10,068 --> 00:43:11,757
Hi Annie.

640
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:14,585
I made a deal with Guiltine
that if she let me go,

641
00:43:14,586 --> 00:43:18,757
I would give her as many
sisters as she could want.

642
00:43:18,758 --> 00:43:20,826
Your own brotherhood...

643
00:43:20,827 --> 00:43:22,000
soul sisters.

644
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Let me out!

645
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,551
Let me out!

646
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:37,826
Let me out!

647
00:43:37,827 --> 00:43:39,620
Let me out!

648
00:44:08,655 --> 00:44:11,550
Oh my God!
Anderson, are you alive?

649
00:44:11,551 --> 00:44:14,792
Tell me honestly, Sergeant.
I will die?

650
00:44:14,793 --> 00:44:16,723
No, no.

651
00:44:16,724 --> 00:44:18,895
You'll be fine.

652
00:44:18,896 --> 00:44:21,447
My legs.
I can't feel my legs.

653
00:44:21,448 --> 00:44:23,757
Why can't I feel my legs?

654
00:44:23,758 --> 00:44:25,999
Y-You're in shock.
Everything will be fine.

655
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,550
It's all getting dark.

656
00:44:27,551 --> 00:44:30,343
So, so dark.

657
00:44:30,344 --> 00:44:32,516
Oh, damn, he's dead.

658
00:44:32,517 --> 00:44:34,205
I really thought
he was going to make it.

659
00:44:34,206 --> 00:44:37,172
Alright, no one else was
bitten in half by the rat monster.

660
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,895
♪ No ♪

661
00:45:17,896 --> 00:45:20,034
♪ That's right, boy ♪

662
00:45:28,689 --> 00:45:32,378
Welcome, welcome.
Welcome to "Ozzy's Dungeon",

663
00:45:32,379 --> 00:45:35,550
where boys and girls
fight toe to toe

664
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:38,792
for the opportunity to have
your favorite wish granted.

665
00:45:38,793 --> 00:45:40,136
That's right, folks.

666
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,274
Anything
your heart desires can

667
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:45,343
be yours if you go
through the obstacle course

668
00:45:45,344 --> 00:45:48,585
not Dungeon Ozzy.

669
00:45:48,586 --> 00:45:52,033
Let's start with
our first challenge!

670
00:45:52,034 --> 00:45:54,826
Are you ready? OK.

671
00:45:54,827 --> 00:45:56,757
AND...

672
00:45:56,758 --> 00:46:00,586
Pop those balloons!

673
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,931
Oh come on la.

674
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:08,585
What do you want?

675
00:46:08,586 --> 00:46:11,826
I want to be a
basketball player

676
00:46:11,827 --> 00:46:13,654
most famous and best in the world.

677
00:46:13,655 --> 00:46:15,550
You don't want to drown, fool.

678
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,378
He's going to be fine, guys.

679
00:46:17,379 --> 00:46:21,343
That's what Ozzy
Dungeon, dungeon does.

680
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:25,067
Here we go with
our first class team

681
00:46:25,068 --> 00:46:26,654
Aid always on hand
to take care of the boys

682
00:46:26,655 --> 00:46:30,171
and girls who
can trip and fall.

683
00:46:30,172 --> 00:46:31,205
They will be...

684
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,585
They will be fine eventually.

685
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:35,619
Oh.

686
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:40,067
I think my stomach is
trying to tell me something.

687
00:46:40,068 --> 00:46:42,654
Anyone else hungry out there?

688
00:46:42,655 --> 00:46:43,896
- I!
- I!

689
00:46:45,758 --> 00:46:49,274
OK then!

690
00:46:49,275 --> 00:46:51,274
Who hasn't seen this movie?

691
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,033
Now our
first team to catch

692
00:46:54,034 --> 00:46:55,447
successfully one
of these delicious,

693
00:46:55,448 --> 00:46:59,550
beautiful coxas from peru
no bucket com a boca

694
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:01,240
will go to the next round.

695
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:03,619
Let's start.

696
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:05,964
Ready and...

697
00:47:05,965 --> 00:47:09,240
Get that meat!

698
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:10,585
It was pretty close, Blue team.

699
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:13,033
Ah, team Amarela,
let's have it

700
00:47:13,034 --> 00:47:14,895
open that mouth a little more.

701
00:47:14,896 --> 00:47:16,171
Oh come on la.

702
00:47:16,172 --> 00:47:18,793
Come on.
Let's open that mouth.

703
00:47:26,724 --> 00:47:31,619
Oh, and we have a winner.

704
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,757
Largue. Largue!

705
00:47:33,758 --> 00:47:37,205
Good girl. Tell us
her name and where she's from.

706
00:47:37,206 --> 00:47:39,447
Donna, and I'm
from Detroit, Michigan.

707
00:47:39,448 --> 00:47:41,895
Oh, Donna gives big D.

708
00:47:41,896 --> 00:47:44,585
Well, you traveled a lot
to get here, didn't you?

709
00:47:44,586 --> 00:47:48,378
Mm-hmm.
We drove all the way here.

710
00:47:48,379 --> 00:47:50,447
- Did you drive?
- Hm-hm.

711
00:47:50,448 --> 00:47:51,654
In a car?

712
00:47:51,655 --> 00:47:54,137
What? You can't
afford to fly?

713
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:59,033
- We're actually doing...
- Right.

714
00:47:59,034 --> 00:48:02,757
So, now you know how
difficult the next challenge is, don't you?

715
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:05,309
Hmm?
Now, many people cannot.

716
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:09,412
In fact, nobody can, Donna.

717
00:48:09,413 --> 00:48:10,481
But I have a hunch.

718
00:48:10,482 --> 00:48:12,516
Oh yes, I have a hunch.

719
00:48:12,517 --> 00:48:14,619
And that feeling
starts at my feet.

720
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:18,723
And it goes higher and higher,
and higher and higher.

721
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:20,309
Anyone else feel this?

722
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,964
Oh yeah.

723
00:48:22,965 --> 00:48:24,930
Oh can you feel it Donna?

724
00:48:24,931 --> 00:48:26,171
Now tell me.

725
00:48:26,172 --> 00:48:28,412
What makes you think
you're better than everyone else

726
00:48:28,413 --> 00:48:31,930
the boys and girls
who came before you?

727
00:48:31,931 --> 00:48:37,550
Well, my family says
I can do anything.

728
00:48:37,551 --> 00:48:39,309
I put my mind to it.

729
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:41,068
I know I can.

730
00:48:42,758 --> 00:48:44,171
Right. Of course.

731
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,619
We'll see.

732
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,757
I like that.

733
00:48:46,758 --> 00:48:48,136
Okay, well Donna, let's just

734
00:48:48,137 --> 00:48:51,550
say that fate
smiled on you

735
00:48:51,551 --> 00:48:57,896
and by some absurd miracle
you make it to the end...

736
00:48:58,965 --> 00:49:01,171
What will you wish for?

737
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:02,551
I will wish...

738
00:49:05,758 --> 00:49:08,862
Any talent lurking
out there that I should know about?

739
00:49:19,655 --> 00:49:22,585
And welcome back
to "Ozzy's Dungeon".

740
00:49:22,586 --> 00:49:24,792
I'm here with the two
remaining contestants.

741
00:49:24,793 --> 00:49:28,378
We got Donna from the
big D, Detroit,

742
00:49:28,379 --> 00:49:31,067
Michigan and Timmy
of the City of Angels,

743
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,171
Los Angeles California.

744
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:37,068
Okay, so who's
ready for the ultimate challenge?

745
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:43,274
Okay kids, let's
start doing

746
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:48,033
our way through
Ozzy's holes

747
00:49:48,034 --> 00:49:50,481
and make our way
back to find

748
00:49:50,482 --> 00:49:53,619
a flag hidden
in the cracked rock.

749
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:57,861
Then we climb the ladder and
go through the mouth hole and

750
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:04,378
down the throat, ending up
in this disgusting, dirty stomach.

751
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:06,757
And then through
the green gelatin,

752
00:50:06,758 --> 00:50:08,274
let's look and let's find

753
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:09,826
ourselves a red flag.

754
00:50:09,827 --> 00:50:11,033
And with that red flag,

755
00:50:11,034 --> 00:50:13,033
let's crawl with our hands

756
00:50:13,034 --> 00:50:15,619
and knees through the
large intestine, and in

757
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:20,205
then along the
poop chute escape route.

758
00:50:20,206 --> 00:50:21,757
Eca!

759
00:50:21,758 --> 00:50:23,516
Now if you beat the
clock, and you give it to me

760
00:50:23,517 --> 00:50:27,447
the red flag
before time runs out,

761
00:50:27,448 --> 00:50:29,550
you will be the first contestant

762
00:50:29,551 --> 00:50:32,447
to reach the dungeon,

763
00:50:32,448 --> 00:50:36,826
meet Ozzy and have
that favorite wish...

764
00:50:36,827 --> 00:50:38,378
guaranteed.

765
00:50:38,379 --> 00:50:40,861
Try!

766
00:50:40,862 --> 00:50:46,309
Okay, now before
anything else,

767
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,067
let's have a minute
on the clock, please.

768
00:50:48,068 --> 00:50:52,171
Wait, children, wait.
Wait until I speak.

769
00:50:52,172 --> 00:50:54,585
In your brands...

770
00:50:54,586 --> 00:50:57,067
get ready...

771
00:50:57,068 --> 00:50:59,619
They go! Through the holes.

772
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,309
And they're out
through the... Oh!

773
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,516
Timmy, what
a horrible start to the game.

774
00:51:04,517 --> 00:51:06,481
Come on.
This is a terrible start.

775
00:51:06,482 --> 00:51:09,516
Now go get or bring that flag.
Let's get going.

776
00:51:09,517 --> 00:51:12,343
Oh, Donna already got the

777
00:51:12,344 --> 00:51:14,067
red flag
and climbed the ladder.

778
00:51:14,068 --> 00:51:15,619
Come on dear!

779
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,619
And here it goes down the throat.

780
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,102
All right, let's look
for that red flag.

781
00:51:21,103 --> 00:51:23,033
Oh, Timmy is dating lacuna.

782
00:51:23,034 --> 00:51:25,688
Oh, adventurer.
Very good, Timmy.

783
00:51:25,689 --> 00:51:27,378
You really did.

784
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:30,378
All right guys, we don't
want to get the uniform dirty.

785
00:51:30,379 --> 00:51:32,861
We found...
Oh, God, you've got the flag.

786
00:51:32,862 --> 00:51:34,447
In the gut you go now.

787
00:51:34,448 --> 00:51:37,619
Timmy is not very good.

788
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,205
One of those... There he goes.

789
00:51:40,206 --> 00:51:43,412
Oh, Timmy almost
stood there for a second.

790
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:45,585
Okay, let's see
who will come out of this

791
00:51:45,586 --> 00:51:49,654
big long
pink hole first.

792
00:51:49,655 --> 00:51:51,895
Who will come out of the intestine

793
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:54,067
long and winding first?

794
00:51:54,068 --> 00:51:55,999
Oh, there she is.

795
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,516
It's Donna leaving...

796
00:51:57,517 --> 00:52:00,551
Ooh, someone got hurt.

797
00:52:02,068 --> 00:52:04,309
No! No, Donna!

798
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,102
Donna! No, let me go there!

799
00:52:06,103 --> 00:52:07,895
I'll get Timmy!
You can not do that!

800
00:52:07,896 --> 00:52:09,757
Have Jesus.

801
00:52:09,758 --> 00:52:11,758
We may need a band-aid.

802
00:52:13,586 --> 00:52:16,309
Oh, for love.
Don't put that in my shoes.

803
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:18,171
Do not do it. Here it is.

804
00:52:18,172 --> 00:52:20,689
You're out, carry on.
Come on, Donna.

805
00:52:31,758 --> 00:52:33,205
Stop the game, please.

806
00:52:33,206 --> 00:52:34,619
Please stop the game!

807
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,340
- Wait, your mother!
- Please stop the game!

808
00:52:48,241 --> 00:52:49,481
Donna arriving.

809
00:52:49,482 --> 00:52:52,206
Ooh, someone got hurt.

810
00:52:55,137 --> 00:52:56,274
Donna arriving.

811
00:52:56,275 --> 00:52:58,896
Ooh, someone got hurt.

812
00:53:01,103 --> 00:53:02,343
Donna arriving.

813
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:05,034
Ooh, someone got hurt.

814
00:53:06,931 --> 00:53:08,826
No, Donna!

815
00:53:08,827 --> 00:53:10,068
Donna!

816
00:53:24,172 --> 00:53:26,654
Throw that shit.

817
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:28,379
Yes mom.

818
00:53:34,379 --> 00:53:35,688
Do you know where you are?

819
00:53:35,689 --> 00:53:37,378
Huh?

820
00:53:37,379 --> 00:53:38,551
Hum?

821
00:53:40,206 --> 00:53:42,586
Does none of this look familiar to you?

822
00:53:43,931 --> 00:53:45,309
This is my set.

823
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,379
It's a pretty good replica, huh?

824
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:53,136
Oh come on la

825
00:53:53,137 --> 00:53:55,171
You will hurt
Marcus' feelings.

826
00:53:55,172 --> 00:53:57,585
- He worked really hard on it.
- Marcus?

827
00:53:57,586 --> 00:53:59,619
- Didn't you, honey?
- I don't know any Marcus.

828
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:02,654
Yes.

829
00:54:02,655 --> 00:54:04,550
Okay, how about
Donna, my daughter?

830
00:54:04,551 --> 00:54:06,447
- Who?
- From Detroit?

831
00:54:06,448 --> 00:54:08,517
I don't know a
Donna from Detroit.

832
00:54:12,827 --> 00:54:14,206
We have a lot of kids on set.

833
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,861
How many were made?

834
00:54:16,862 --> 00:54:18,205
Ah!

835
00:54:18,206 --> 00:54:22,413
You signed the waiver.
You signed a waiver.

836
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:28,965
Everyone... everyone
signs a waiver.

837
00:54:31,482 --> 00:54:33,999
Baby?

838
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,379
Baby? Come on, dear.

839
00:54:39,689 --> 00:54:44,171
Who cares about
a goddamn quit, bro?

840
00:54:44,172 --> 00:54:46,033
Honey, honey,
your blood pressure.

841
00:54:46,034 --> 00:54:47,792
- Mommy?
- I just...

842
00:54:47,793 --> 00:54:50,792
I think I just need to
take this shirt off.

843
00:54:50,793 --> 00:54:51,965
You fucked up.

844
00:54:56,517 --> 00:54:59,275
Barely...

845
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:03,102
Oh my God.

846
00:55:03,103 --> 00:55:06,861
What are you doing?

847
00:55:06,862 --> 00:55:08,274
That's better.

848
00:55:08,275 --> 00:55:10,861
Do you know what it
looked like to me?

849
00:55:10,862 --> 00:55:14,447
It's just that you
motherfuckers created a track

850
00:55:14,448 --> 00:55:18,240
impossible obstacles that
shattered a little star.

851
00:55:18,241 --> 00:55:20,033
She would be the only one.

852
00:55:20,034 --> 00:55:22,688
She will be the one to leave.

853
00:55:22,689 --> 00:55:24,447
He is well.

854
00:55:24,448 --> 00:55:26,103
But look at that leg!

855
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,344
Show him that mutilated bitch!

856
00:55:32,793 --> 00:55:35,309
- Live? live?
- Ah!

857
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:38,688
Because it seems...?

858
00:55:38,689 --> 00:55:41,379
Nobody wants to see
that on the big screen.

859
00:55:44,068 --> 00:55:46,585
What does it look like?

860
00:55:46,586 --> 00:55:48,964
- I don't know. It looks...
- What does it look like? Say!

861
00:55:48,965 --> 00:55:52,895
- I don't know, it looks like...
- It looks like dog meat!

862
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:55,068
Looks like puppy meat, okay?

863
00:55:56,344 --> 00:55:59,688
Fuck you, you idiot.

864
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,205
Don't do it, honey.

865
00:56:02,206 --> 00:56:03,999
I'm sorry.

866
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,412
We almost had a winner
before everything was cancelled.

867
00:56:07,413 --> 00:56:10,895
Okay, I mean the
show is not rigged.

868
00:56:10,896 --> 00:56:15,171
Your showbiz,
motherfuckers from LA leave my

869
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:16,447
pussy drier
than the Sahary desert.

870
00:56:16,448 --> 00:56:19,171
- Sarah, dear.
- Cala to mouth.

871
00:56:19,172 --> 00:56:23,930
Oh fuck.

872
00:56:23,931 --> 00:56:26,516
Let's just...

873
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:28,654
- Suffice it to say it's not manipulated.
- No.

874
00:56:28,655 --> 00:56:30,378
Can't you
prove this theory?

875
00:56:30,379 --> 00:56:31,757
- Or what?
- Huh?!

876
00:56:31,758 --> 00:56:34,033
What? What the
fuck are you talking about?

877
00:56:34,034 --> 00:56:37,240
Fred, swallow me or mug.

878
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:39,481
Q-Which?

879
00:56:39,482 --> 00:56:42,723
One who has no water.

880
00:56:42,724 --> 00:56:44,964
You can't do this, honey.

881
00:56:44,965 --> 00:56:46,309
I won't say it again.

882
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:48,896
The fuck is in it? Huh?

883
00:56:50,103 --> 00:56:51,930
What the fuck is there?

884
00:56:51,931 --> 00:56:53,964
I didn't tell you I'd
get your cast

885
00:56:53,965 --> 00:56:55,447
dreams if you did
what i told you to do?

886
00:56:55,448 --> 00:56:56,550
- Yea.
- Cum?

887
00:56:56,551 --> 00:56:58,274
My people know I'm here.

888
00:56:58,275 --> 00:57:00,343
They're going to come after
me, you know, right?

889
00:57:00,344 --> 00:57:02,378
They will come after me.
What the fuck is this?

890
00:57:02,379 --> 00:57:04,102
oh! Club!

891
00:57:04,103 --> 00:57:06,585
- Honey!
- Keep that shit away from me.

892
00:57:06,586 --> 00:57:09,379
Raise-o.

893
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:14,619
Look, if we give every kid
their wish, we'd be fucked.

894
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,585
You know we're without a budget.

895
00:57:16,586 --> 00:57:18,205
Ah!

896
00:57:18,206 --> 00:57:20,861
Oh, what's the problem? Huh?

897
00:57:20,862 --> 00:57:23,964
Are you worried
about your beautiful

898
00:57:23,965 --> 00:57:25,274
face bubbling and
melting on my floor?

899
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,067
- Just...
- Huh?

900
00:57:28,068 --> 00:57:29,585
Smell it!

901
00:57:29,586 --> 00:57:32,723
Ooh.

902
00:57:32,724 --> 00:57:36,999
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

903
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,999
What the fuck are you doing?

904
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,205
This is the first challenge.

905
00:57:42,206 --> 00:57:45,274
No, no.
No, I need a helmet!

906
00:57:45,275 --> 00:57:47,792
- Three two one!
- No, untie me!

907
00:57:47,793 --> 00:57:50,896
- Untie me!
- To charge!

908
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:56,275
Oh! Oh fuck!

909
00:58:03,862 --> 00:58:06,343
Are you ready for
our next challenge?

910
00:58:06,344 --> 00:58:08,136
Huh?

911
00:58:08,137 --> 00:58:10,309
Are you hungry?

912
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:13,137
Because it's lunch time!

913
00:58:15,275 --> 00:58:16,895
- Very good.
- What the hell is that?

914
00:58:16,896 --> 00:58:21,033
Three two one!

915
00:58:21,034 --> 00:58:24,895
Get that meat!

916
00:58:24,896 --> 00:58:26,240
No! No! No!

917
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:28,654
- Wow!
- No!

918
00:58:28,655 --> 00:58:30,723
Lets go Girl.

919
00:58:30,724 --> 00:58:32,067
- Here it is.
- No!

920
00:58:32,068 --> 00:58:35,309
Takes it!
Come on, doggy, get it!

921
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:38,171
I really can't catch it.

922
00:58:38,172 --> 00:58:40,516
- Takes it.
- I am trying!

923
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,205
- Takes it!
- I am trying!

924
00:58:43,206 --> 00:58:46,171
Lets go Girl.
Let me show you how to do this.

925
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:47,586
I can't catch.

926
00:58:48,689 --> 00:58:50,827
You have to
put it here and then...

927
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:55,378
Just put everything
in his mouth hole.

928
00:58:55,379 --> 00:58:57,895
Oh, that's right, doggie.

929
00:58:57,896 --> 00:58:59,136
It took very well.

930
00:58:59,137 --> 00:59:01,172
Oh shit.

931
00:59:02,758 --> 00:59:03,793
Ah.

932
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,206
Brandon, get that
damn camera off the floor.

933
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:27,723
Okay, Mr. game show host.

934
00:59:27,724 --> 00:59:32,481
Now, when I say, you
're going to jump through these holes.

935
00:59:32,482 --> 00:59:35,585
Go up the ladder, up
through the mouth, down the

936
00:59:35,586 --> 00:59:40,033
stomach slide
to this pool here.

937
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:41,550
Mm-mm-mmm.

938
00:59:41,551 --> 00:59:44,033
Oh my God.

939
00:59:44,034 --> 00:59:48,205
Then you will
find a flag.

940
00:59:48,206 --> 00:59:50,378
when you find this

941
00:59:50,379 --> 00:59:52,930
flag, you
will leave this way,

942
00:59:52,931 --> 00:59:55,999
go through the bowels,
make your way through everyone

943
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,206
your slides and
slides until you reach the exit.

944
01:00:03,034 --> 01:00:04,965
You have 60 seconds.

945
01:00:15,034 --> 01:00:18,137
What is all this brown stuff?

946
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,586
Well, it sure isn't bean sauce.

947
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:26,586
What if I don't finish?

948
01:00:28,379 --> 01:00:29,862
No!

949
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:36,343
- Get ready.
- Okay.

950
01:00:37,344 --> 01:00:39,655
Ready, go!

951
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:45,586
Come on doggy, come on.

952
01:00:46,827 --> 01:00:50,379
Run that run,
run that run, run that run!

953
01:00:52,172 --> 01:00:54,379
Here it is.

954
01:00:56,551 --> 01:00:57,723
Try!

955
01:00:57,724 --> 01:01:00,895
I can not. I can not.

956
01:01:00,896 --> 01:01:02,551
You still have more
things to do!

957
01:01:06,965 --> 01:01:08,654
Go under the poop shooter.

958
01:01:08,655 --> 01:01:12,171
I don't think I
can get through this.

959
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:14,103
Go through everything.

960
01:01:20,896 --> 01:01:22,826
Oh oh oh.

961
01:01:22,827 --> 01:01:24,930
Time is running out.

962
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:27,413
Will he make it?

963
01:01:32,827 --> 01:01:34,102
Through the shit city.

964
01:01:34,103 --> 01:01:35,964
Go under.

965
01:01:35,965 --> 01:01:38,033
I am going. I am going.

966
01:01:38,034 --> 01:01:40,931
I can do this.
I can do this.

967
01:01:47,965 --> 01:01:52,033
I achieved!
I achieved! I achieved!

968
01:01:52,034 --> 01:01:54,309
I won your stupid game.

969
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:56,102
I just couldn't
do it, could I, son?

970
01:01:56,103 --> 01:01:59,343
I beat the fucking clock.

971
01:01:59,344 --> 01:02:01,171
I beat the fucking clock.

972
01:02:01,172 --> 01:02:03,068
You are a few seconds late.

973
01:02:07,034 --> 01:02:09,724
I'm very sorry.

974
01:02:11,068 --> 01:02:13,619
Brandon, get up-o.

975
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:14,620
No!

976
01:02:18,586 --> 01:02:20,205
No winners.

977
01:02:20,206 --> 01:02:24,102
No wishes.

978
01:02:24,103 --> 01:02:25,447
Just pain.

979
01:02:25,448 --> 01:02:27,757
- What is this?
- What is this?

980
01:02:27,758 --> 01:02:29,688
What is this thing?
What is this?

981
01:02:29,689 --> 01:02:31,172
What is this?

982
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,102
Wishes.

983
01:02:36,103 --> 01:02:39,585
This is all about wishes, right?
Right?

984
01:02:39,586 --> 01:02:43,447
I can help make her wish come true.
I can help you.

985
01:02:43,448 --> 01:02:45,792
Are you fucking with me now?

986
01:02:45,793 --> 01:02:47,067
No, no.

987
01:02:47,068 --> 01:02:49,757
I thought Ozzy was
out of this world, cancelled.

988
01:02:49,758 --> 01:02:53,757
I know where is.

989
01:02:53,758 --> 01:02:55,516
I know where is.

990
01:02:55,517 --> 01:03:00,067
Baby, does this thing
do super close-ups?

991
01:03:00,068 --> 01:03:02,447
'Cause I'm going to show
you all how to make a damn...

992
01:03:02,448 --> 01:03:05,205
No! No!
I'll take you to him!

993
01:03:05,206 --> 01:03:08,068
I'll take you to him!

994
01:03:09,689 --> 01:03:11,379
I will take you to him.

995
01:03:27,965 --> 01:03:29,172
what the hell?

996
01:03:32,103 --> 01:03:38,171
The security got
a little…robust.

997
01:03:38,172 --> 01:03:41,067
Okay, okay. Everything is fine.

998
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:43,757
We can't
get in here anymore.

999
01:03:43,758 --> 01:03:45,481
We have to go deep hairs.

1000
01:03:45,482 --> 01:03:47,585
What the fuck do you mean
he can't go this way?

1001
01:03:47,586 --> 01:03:49,241
Club.

1002
01:03:55,896 --> 01:03:59,171
Do you remember that, Donna?

1003
01:03:59,172 --> 01:04:00,688
Don't talk to him, honey.

1004
01:04:00,689 --> 01:04:02,378
He is well. Everything is fine.

1005
01:04:02,379 --> 01:04:03,895
You leave my girl alone.

1006
01:04:03,896 --> 01:04:05,482
You've done enough.

1007
01:04:20,137 --> 01:04:21,689
He is well.

1008
01:04:25,034 --> 01:04:26,861
Do you trust this guy, baby?

1009
01:04:26,862 --> 01:04:28,964
Of course not, but it is

1010
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,245
here we have to be.

1011
01:04:37,827 --> 01:04:39,172
Oh shit.

1012
01:04:48,482 --> 01:04:49,586
Oh shit.

1013
01:04:56,034 --> 01:04:58,274
- Go ahead, honey.
- OK.

1014
01:04:58,275 --> 01:05:00,895
Go ahead, I'll follow you.

1015
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:03,481
All right, Donna baby.

1016
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:07,205
Mom said she
'll get your wish.

1017
01:05:07,206 --> 01:05:08,655
I will get your wish.

1018
01:05:20,965 --> 01:05:23,447
This is a real cave.

1019
01:05:23,448 --> 01:05:26,723
What the fuck do you mean
by a real cave?

1020
01:05:26,724 --> 01:05:29,033
I had never
walked through the door before.

1021
01:05:29,034 --> 01:05:31,447
Oh shit.

1022
01:05:31,448 --> 01:05:33,171
We'll be fine.

1023
01:05:33,172 --> 01:05:36,723
I guarantee I'm meaner than
anything we'll find here.

1024
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:42,757
We want that
new car and $10... $15 million. OK?

1025
01:05:42,758 --> 01:05:44,930
Don't promise her
all these things.

1026
01:05:44,931 --> 01:05:47,757
Shit to mouth, Vinn.

1027
01:05:47,758 --> 01:05:50,068
Yes, Mom, I'm scared.

1028
01:05:52,965 --> 01:05:55,481
It's so dark here.

1029
01:05:55,482 --> 01:05:58,274
Can you hear this song baby?

1030
01:05:58,275 --> 01:05:59,482
- Mnh-mnh.
- No?

1031
01:06:01,172 --> 01:06:02,999
What... What?

1032
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,757
What is that?

1033
01:06:05,758 --> 01:06:06,862
Baby?

1034
01:06:12,137 --> 01:06:13,172
Wait.

1035
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:17,896
Wait.

1036
01:06:21,827 --> 01:06:24,068
What?

1037
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:29,826
Here.

1038
01:06:29,827 --> 01:06:31,205
He is well.

1039
01:06:31,206 --> 01:06:32,240
What are you doing?

1040
01:06:32,241 --> 01:06:33,655
He is well.

1041
01:06:35,689 --> 01:06:37,517
He knows my aura.

1042
01:07:24,827 --> 01:07:26,482
Make it a good wish, girl.

1043
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:09,516
Mommy Daddy? What the hell is that?

1044
01:08:09,517 --> 01:08:10,965
Mom, Dad, what...

1045
01:08:19,965 --> 01:08:22,171
- What the hell is that?
- No!

1046
01:08:22,172 --> 01:08:25,930
- Jesus!
- Mommy!

1047
01:08:25,931 --> 01:08:27,309
Papi!

1048
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:28,550
What the hell?!

1049
01:08:28,551 --> 01:08:30,310
What... What the hell is she...

1050
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:34,550
Get down, get down.

1051
01:08:34,551 --> 01:08:36,757
Which...?

1052
01:08:36,758 --> 01:08:38,136
I don't understand.

1053
01:08:38,137 --> 01:08:40,517
What the fuck is going on?

1054
01:08:42,965 --> 01:08:44,275
Oh!

1055
01:08:47,586 --> 01:08:50,137
What did you do, bitch?!
What did you wish for?!

1056
01:09:30,103 --> 01:09:32,895
What the fuck are you
doing, loser?

1057
01:09:32,896 --> 01:09:34,171
Hey. Hey, is that my camera?

1058
01:09:34,172 --> 01:09:35,612
No, don't put your hand...

1059
01:09:43,896 --> 01:09:45,379
No.

1060
01:09:49,137 --> 01:09:50,826
No.

1061
01:09:51,827 --> 01:09:53,826
Oh. Oh, do you like it?

1062
01:09:53,827 --> 01:09:56,688
Oh, do you like these?
Yes, I thought you would.

1063
01:09:56,689 --> 01:09:59,274
Yes, I'm a big boy.

1064
01:09:59,275 --> 01:10:01,931
Oh, do you like big boys?
Yes, I thought you would.

1065
01:10:03,655 --> 01:10:07,619
Someone better call the
vet, these pythons are sick.

1066
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,378
Did you say something, honey?

1067
01:10:09,379 --> 01:10:11,619
Yes, yes, yes, no... Don't come in.

1068
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,343
Do not do it. I am studying.

1069
01:10:13,344 --> 01:10:15,930
OK.
What do you want for lunch?

1070
01:10:15,931 --> 01:10:17,723
Hot Pockets.

1071
01:10:17,724 --> 01:10:20,206
God, of course.

1072
01:10:42,482 --> 01:10:45,517
Holy crap.

1073
01:10:49,034 --> 01:10:51,343
No no. No. No! No!

1074
01:10:51,344 --> 01:10:54,067
Hey, you there. Come on...
Is that a camera?

1075
01:10:54,068 --> 01:10:56,412
No... I'll tell your parents.

1076
01:10:56,413 --> 01:10:58,102
No!

1077
01:10:58,103 --> 01:10:59,793
What a drug!

1078
01:11:05,034 --> 01:11:06,793
No, shh, shh, shh.

1079
01:11:13,448 --> 01:11:14,758
Sh, sh.

1080
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:26,689
Hey, should we get the cream?

1081
01:11:42,517 --> 01:11:44,379
Do it again, do it again.

1082
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:50,309
Oh!

1083
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:53,481
- Fucking shit.
- Bonner.

1084
01:11:53,482 --> 01:11:55,447
- Boner, what happened, bro?
- What happened friend?

1085
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:57,033
- You got me.
- Did you just come on yourself?

1086
01:11:57,034 --> 01:11:59,516
Was that cool, bro?

1087
01:11:59,517 --> 01:12:02,102
Wow, man, this is crazy.

1088
01:12:02,103 --> 01:12:03,103
- Wow.
- What the hell is that?

1089
01:12:03,104 --> 01:12:06,136
Wow, what is this?

1090
01:12:06,137 --> 01:12:07,826
What... hey.

1091
01:12:07,827 --> 01:12:10,481
Ah, man, that's a
gnarled snake, bro.

1092
01:12:10,482 --> 01:12:11,965
An anaconda.

1093
01:12:14,034 --> 01:12:15,343
Look at that strip, man.

1094
01:12:15,344 --> 01:12:17,757
Oh!

1095
01:12:17,758 --> 01:12:19,861
- Hey!
- Eca! Shit, hand.

1096
01:12:19,862 --> 01:12:21,861
Hey, Boner, I'll give you 50 cents
if you eat right now.

1097
01:12:21,862 --> 01:12:23,982
I'll fuck your
mother for 50 cents, bro.

1098
01:12:26,344 --> 01:12:28,481
Oh!

1099
01:12:28,482 --> 01:12:30,136
I don't believe this boy.

1100
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:33,033
Hey, after that, we should head
upstairs to Blockbuster, yeah?

1101
01:12:33,034 --> 01:12:34,343
No, man, RadioShack
is way better.

1102
01:12:34,344 --> 01:12:36,205
No, man, I was there yesterday.

1103
01:12:36,206 --> 01:12:38,274
Not. You're traveling, bro.

1104
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:39,955
Bro, do you know who
they look like to me?

1105
01:12:40,724 --> 01:12:42,033
Oh shit.

1106
01:12:42,034 --> 01:12:43,171
- Club.
- Expensive.

1107
01:12:43,172 --> 01:12:45,034
Brother, are you okay?

1108
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:49,171
- I am fine.
- Oh!

1109
01:12:51,689 --> 01:12:53,688
- Oh shit. I-is this normal?
- No, no.

1110
01:12:54,793 --> 01:12:56,999
Dave, it's not real.
There's no way...

1111
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:58,912
Okay, I'm telling you, it's real.

1112
01:12:58,913 --> 01:12:59,223
And y'all need to take
this shit more seriously.

1113
01:12:59,224 --> 01:13:00,824
- Okay, right.
- Yes, that would be crazy.

1114
01:13:01,948 --> 01:13:03,257
Okay, you know what?
Just observe.

1115
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:04,878
The New Year will come and
all the unbelievers will

1116
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:06,257
fuck off, and there's
no way in hell

1117
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:07,671
that I'm going to make you, any
of you sick even.

1118
01:13:07,672 --> 01:13:09,223
Not Y2K bomb coat.

1119
01:13:09,224 --> 01:13:11,843
Oh no. What are we
going to do without...

1120
01:13:11,844 --> 01:13:13,981
Or Boner's bomb coat, face.

1121
01:13:13,982 --> 01:13:15,154
- Open door.
- Cale-se.

1122
01:13:15,155 --> 01:13:16,326
Hey, what the fuck
are you writing?

1123
01:13:16,327 --> 01:13:17,843
My supplies, okay?

1124
01:13:17,844 --> 01:13:20,774
I need to have PT, condom,
obviously, and then...

1125
01:13:20,775 --> 01:13:22,602
- Why?
- How so why?

1126
01:13:22,603 --> 01:13:23,947
I think the end of the world is over

1127
01:13:23,948 --> 01:13:25,292
likely than
you get laid, bro.

1128
01:13:25,293 --> 01:13:27,361
100 percent, man.

1129
01:13:27,362 --> 01:13:29,188
- This is the stupidest...
- It will work.

1130
01:13:29,189 --> 01:13:31,705
- This is the stupidest...
- It will work!

1131
01:13:31,706 --> 01:13:33,016
You are a fucking idiot.

1132
01:13:33,017 --> 01:13:35,050
Dude,
it sure works.

1133
01:13:35,051 --> 01:13:37,878
Eu vi em "Candid Camera".

1134
01:13:37,879 --> 01:13:38,947
God.

1135
01:13:38,948 --> 01:13:41,120
Look, it's practically invisible.

1136
01:13:43,431 --> 01:13:44,741
Hey, guys. Hey.

1137
01:13:47,258 --> 01:13:49,672
- Follow me.
- All right, calm down, bro.

1138
01:14:01,534 --> 01:14:04,050
He is fine?

1139
01:14:04,051 --> 01:14:05,774
Hey, girls.

1140
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,671
What's happening?
How are you?

1141
01:14:07,672 --> 01:14:08,740
- Hey.
- Hey.

1142
01:14:08,741 --> 01:14:10,809
What are your names?

1143
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:14,119
I'm Cassidy, and this is Emma.

1144
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:17,361
Cassidy, Emma, ​​Emma, ​​Cassidy.
Legal.

1145
01:14:17,362 --> 01:14:19,947
My name is Breckie, and my
friends call me Brex.

1146
01:14:19,948 --> 01:14:23,223
Like music and such. Um, I
have a question for you.

1147
01:14:23,224 --> 01:14:25,430
Hmm, I'm with some friends

1148
01:14:25,431 --> 01:14:26,705
here, but we are hungry.

1149
01:14:26,706 --> 01:14:28,809
- Is that a camera?
- No.

1150
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:30,361
- Are you serious?
- No, no.

1151
01:14:30,362 --> 01:14:33,257
Wow, you are so perverted.
You little worm.

1152
01:14:33,258 --> 01:14:34,567
Yeah, you better run, you worm.

1153
01:14:34,568 --> 01:14:35,706
I liked your dress!

1154
01:14:52,189 --> 01:14:53,637
Oh yeah.

1155
01:14:56,189 --> 01:14:58,086
Oh shit.

1156
01:15:27,086 --> 01:15:31,120
- So fucking hot.
- Shit.

1157
01:15:41,741 --> 01:15:43,534
Go Go.

1158
01:15:45,224 --> 01:15:48,981
Oh my God.
You weren't lying.

1159
01:15:48,982 --> 01:15:51,809
Man, she's been there every
day since she moved.

1160
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:54,119
How often
can you clean a car?

1161
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:57,809
I'm telling you, my new
top three in hitting one,

1162
01:15:57,810 --> 01:15:59,981
Sarah Michelle Gellar,

1163
01:15:59,982 --> 01:16:02,809
Britney Spears
and this girl over there.

1164
01:16:02,810 --> 01:16:05,050
You're so lucky you

1165
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:07,223
- of that piece of ass.
- Dude, I know, I know.

1166
01:16:07,224 --> 01:16:09,292
Look, she's bowing.
Look.

1167
01:16:09,293 --> 01:16:10,672
- Oh.
- Oh!

1168
01:16:13,534 --> 01:16:16,774
Hey guys, what are you doing?

1169
01:16:16,775 --> 01:16:18,395
- Boo!
- Mind your own business, idiot.

1170
01:16:18,396 --> 01:16:19,947
Hey, what did I say
about coming to my room

1171
01:16:19,948 --> 01:16:21,430
- sem be invited?
- Come on, Dy.

1172
01:16:21,431 --> 01:16:22,912
- Outside!
- I'm not intruding.

1173
01:16:22,913 --> 01:16:24,223
Now!

1174
01:16:24,224 --> 01:16:26,809

1175
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:28,257
Will he deliver?

1176
01:16:28,258 --> 01:16:30,119
No, we're holding your
war hammer hostage.

1177
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:30,982
We are well.

1178
01:16:30,983 --> 01:16:32,948
- Dude, let's go.
- Incredible.

1179
01:16:34,913 --> 01:16:37,051
Holy crap!

1180
01:16:38,258 --> 01:16:40,464
Look at her hand on
that hose, bro.

1181
01:16:40,465 --> 01:16:42,016
Look at that grip, man.

1182
01:16:42,017 --> 01:16:43,533
Oh yes, dear.

1183
01:16:43,534 --> 01:16:46,016
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- No!

1184
01:16:46,017 --> 01:16:47,671
- No!
- No, move your van!

1185
01:16:47,672 --> 01:16:49,809
- Seriously, man?
- Right in front.

1186
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:51,326
It sucks, man.

1187
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:53,430
- Damned.
- Come on, honey.

1188
01:16:53,431 --> 01:16:56,671
- Hate this guy.
- This sucks, bro.

1189
01:16:56,672 --> 01:16:58,981
Hey, pull your shorts
up a little.

1190
01:16:58,982 --> 01:17:00,154
Ah, he has to prepare.

1191
01:17:00,155 --> 01:17:02,292
- No way, bro.
- Hey dude. Hey.

1192
01:17:02,293 --> 01:17:04,223
- Ah, ele acha...
- Come on. Let's go.

1193
01:17:04,224 --> 01:17:05,671
What does he think she will do?

1194
01:17:05,672 --> 01:17:07,947
- Brother.
- Oh no, man.

1195
01:17:07,948 --> 01:17:11,567
You can see how
disgusted she looks.

1196
01:17:11,568 --> 01:17:13,740
- Not that! There!
- Oh shit!

1197
01:17:13,741 --> 01:17:15,430
- She... she just went...
- Wait.

1198
01:17:15,431 --> 01:17:17,326
Is this a new Macintosh?

1199
01:17:17,327 --> 01:17:19,887
Is she trying... is she
trying to fund my college?

1200
01:17:20,396 --> 01:17:21,671
You could make my sugar mom.

1201
01:17:21,672 --> 01:17:23,464
Oh, man, you're
telling me, man.

1202
01:17:23,465 --> 01:17:25,602
Man, he's still talking to her.

1203
01:17:25,603 --> 01:17:26,947
- Loser.
- Hey!

1204
01:17:26,948 --> 01:17:28,878
- She's leaving.
- She can't hear you.

1205
01:17:28,879 --> 01:17:30,292
She's not interested.

1206
01:17:30,293 --> 01:17:33,671
- Sai, honey.
- Now. It touches, hand.

1207
01:17:33,672 --> 01:17:35,602
- No!
- No!

1208
01:17:35,603 --> 01:17:36,912
No chance dear!

1209
01:17:36,913 --> 01:17:39,533
Not the damn... oh!

1210
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:42,050
Oh shit, man.

1211
01:17:42,051 --> 01:17:43,257
Oh shit.

1212
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:45,362
- Get out of here.
- Brother.

1213
01:17:48,568 --> 01:17:51,671
What's with all
these weird statues?

1214
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:53,809
Maybe her family is European?

1215
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:56,774
They are elegant and
sexually liberal.

1216
01:17:56,775 --> 01:17:58,603
- Mm.
- Oh.

1217
01:18:02,155 --> 01:18:05,395
Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

1218
01:18:05,396 --> 01:18:06,556
I think I'm in love.

1219
01:18:09,672 --> 01:18:11,395
- Oh.
- Oh my God.

1220
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:13,809
She's going to take a shower.
Go Go go.

1221
01:18:13,810 --> 01:18:16,326
- Please please please.
- She's going to be naked.

1222
01:18:16,327 --> 01:18:18,085
- Please.
- No, no!

1223
01:18:18,086 --> 01:18:19,705
- Don't do anything else!
- No!

1224
01:18:19,706 --> 01:18:21,912
Drug.

1225
01:18:21,913 --> 01:18:23,326
We have to get a better angle.

1226
01:18:23,327 --> 01:18:26,050
Okay, I'll buy the
safe from you for $100.

1227
01:18:26,051 --> 01:18:27,843
end offer.

1228
01:18:27,844 --> 01:18:29,671
Saia gives current, hand.

1229
01:18:29,672 --> 01:18:32,361
You have Limp
Bizkit, you have the

1230
01:18:32,362 --> 01:18:33,636
Creed, you got
Whole, you got...

1231
01:18:33,637 --> 01:18:34,878
Hey guys, let's get Boner out of her.

1232
01:18:34,879 --> 01:18:36,188
Come on la Boner.

1233
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:38,188
Ah!

1234
01:18:38,189 --> 01:18:39,774
Dude, I swear...

1235
01:18:39,775 --> 01:18:41,326
- I have your concert.
- Oh, come on... Shut up, man.

1236
01:18:41,327 --> 01:18:42,878
Come on, come on,
I'm killing now.

1237
01:18:42,879 --> 01:18:45,671
- No.
- Crippled.

1238
01:18:45,672 --> 01:18:48,119
Your brother is badass.

1239
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,878
Oh shit.

1240
01:18:49,879 --> 01:18:50,947
- Oh.
- Wait.

1241
01:18:50,948 --> 01:18:52,085
He has his baby pads.

1242
01:18:52,086 --> 01:18:54,809
- What he is doing?
- Cum.

1243
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:57,774
I can't believe I
'm related to him.

1244
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,465
- Hey, look.
- Oh.

1245
01:19:04,672 --> 01:19:06,016
He's not going to rat us out, right?

1246
01:19:06,017 --> 01:19:08,603
Because I need
it, like, it's really bad.

1247
01:19:10,155 --> 01:19:11,912
- What the hell is that?
- Hey, you don't just walk with it.

1248
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:13,912
and talk to a girl like that.

1249
01:19:13,913 --> 01:19:16,567
- Get away from her.
- What the fuck?!

1250
01:19:16,568 --> 01:19:19,188
Hey, did she just
voluntarily touch you?

1251
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:20,257
Is she holding his hand?

1252
01:19:20,258 --> 01:19:21,671
This is not happening now.

1253
01:19:21,672 --> 01:19:24,740
- Wow.
- He... he's going in.

1254
01:19:24,741 --> 01:19:26,636
Expensive. fucking shit.

1255
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:28,223
She probably feels bad for him.

1256
01:19:28,224 --> 01:19:30,809
Oh my God. I want her
to feel bad for me every day.

1257
01:19:30,810 --> 01:19:33,326
Brady is a goddamn pimp.

1258
01:19:33,327 --> 01:19:34,741
Hey, go to mouth, face.

1259
01:19:37,327 --> 01:19:39,085
Brady, man, my eternal respect.

1260
01:19:39,086 --> 01:19:40,567
Hey, does she have a boyfriend?

1261
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:41,809
How does she smell?

1262
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:43,154
Does she smell
like a hot girl?

1263
01:19:43,155 --> 01:19:44,912
Who? Sandra?

1264
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:46,843
- Holy crap.
- Do you know her first name?

1265
01:19:46,844 --> 01:19:48,257
Hey, hey, hey, let the boy talk.

1266
01:19:48,258 --> 01:19:50,050
Oh my God.

1267
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:51,499
Yes, I should go
over there and help her

1268
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:53,085
set up a
webcam tomorrow, so...

1269
01:19:53,086 --> 01:19:54,671
Oh shit, face.

1270
01:19:54,672 --> 01:19:57,085
It looks like a date.

1271
01:19:57,086 --> 01:19:59,326
Man, I never would have
guessed that he

1272
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,407
He has more flair than
his older brother.

1273
01:20:01,637 --> 01:20:03,431
Hey, go to mouth!

1274
01:20:05,327 --> 01:20:07,017
I had an idea.

1275
01:20:08,879 --> 01:20:12,017
Okay, just tell me.
It's possible?

1276
01:20:13,844 --> 01:20:15,671
Yes, I could install
a spyware program,

1277
01:20:15,672 --> 01:20:18,257
but if I get caught, she
's going to... she's going to kill me.

1278
01:20:18,258 --> 01:20:19,809
Then you will die hero.

1279
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:23,878
Brady, if you do this,
you will be a legend of the

1280
01:20:23,879 --> 01:20:27,499
Fuck, besides being able to
hang out with us tonight.

1281
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:28,879
Seriously?

1282
01:20:30,086 --> 01:20:31,188
He's in, boys.

1283
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:33,051
Here we go.

1284
01:20:37,741 --> 01:20:40,430
- Don't look...
- Turn around!

1285
01:20:40,431 --> 01:20:42,636
- Oh my God.
- Damn Brady.

1286
01:20:42,637 --> 01:20:44,326
Dude, your brother. Oh my God.

1287
01:20:44,327 --> 01:20:45,912
Jesus Christ.

1288
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:46,920
No.

1289
01:20:47,879 --> 01:20:49,223
Perhaps she is a sculptor.

1290
01:20:49,224 --> 01:20:50,430
Man, they kind
of look like Boner.

1291
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:52,396
- No no.
- Ok, sim.

1292
01:20:54,431 --> 01:20:55,602
They look alike.

1293
01:20:55,603 --> 01:20:58,189
Cale-se.

1294
01:21:00,189 --> 01:21:01,982
Dear Penthouse.

1295
01:21:04,224 --> 01:21:05,603
Damned.

1296
01:21:10,844 --> 01:21:12,499
All right, all right, end it.

1297
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:15,016
Mm, I really need this.

1298
01:21:15,017 --> 01:21:17,499
- Shit, man.
- I can't watch.

1299
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:19,602
I am gonna puke.

1300
01:21:19,603 --> 01:21:20,809
It's okay, Boner.

1301
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:22,499
Yeah, I'm kind of nervous.

1302
01:21:22,500 --> 01:21:24,810
Now or never, man.
Go! Go! Go.

1303
01:21:25,879 --> 01:21:28,637
What the hell is spyware anyway?

1304
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:32,257
- OK.
- Shit.

1305
01:21:32,258 --> 01:21:35,567
Come on Brady, you can do it.
You can.

1306
01:21:35,568 --> 01:21:36,774
- Oh my God.
- Oh shit.

1307
01:21:36,775 --> 01:21:38,878
- Oh my God.
- You have to hurry.

1308
01:21:38,879 --> 01:21:40,879
- Jesus.
- Oh my God.

1309
01:21:44,155 --> 01:21:45,843
- And now.
- I can't watch this, man.

1310
01:21:45,844 --> 01:21:47,257
- Fuck, fuck.
- He's dead, he's dead.

1311
01:21:47,258 --> 01:21:48,636
He is dead.

1312
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:52,567
- Yeah...
- I'm going to throw up.

1313
01:21:52,568 --> 01:21:54,154
- Oh, we understand each other.
- Let's go! Let's go.

1314
01:21:54,155 --> 01:21:55,257
He managed?

1315
01:21:55,258 --> 01:21:58,119
- That's it...?
- Oh shit.

1316
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:01,120
Hey, that's some
"golden eye" shit right there, man.

1317
01:22:02,431 --> 01:22:04,878
This boy is taking too long.

1318
01:22:04,879 --> 01:22:07,361
Let him do his thing.

1319
01:22:07,362 --> 01:22:09,188
Baby, God, I know I never

1320
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:11,050
I pray to you
about nothing, ever,

1321
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:14,430
but please don't
be an idiot about it.

1322
01:22:14,431 --> 01:22:15,567
It worked?

1323
01:22:15,568 --> 01:22:16,636
We're in.

1324
01:22:16,637 --> 01:22:18,981
- Yea!
- Do not play.

1325
01:22:18,982 --> 01:22:20,947
- The boy did it.
- Yea.

1326
01:22:20,948 --> 01:22:22,430
Hey, he was a kid
five minutes ago.

1327
01:22:22,431 --> 01:22:24,913
This gentleman is a man.

1328
01:22:25,913 --> 01:22:27,741
- Hey, you did well.
- Nice.

1329
01:22:29,465 --> 01:22:31,257
- Health.
- Cheers, man.

1330
01:22:31,258 --> 01:22:33,361
Glorious.

1331
01:22:33,362 --> 01:22:34,878
Wow.

1332
01:22:34,879 --> 01:22:37,119
The technology is amazing, man.

1333
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,080
- Hey, Boner, this is my computer.
- Hey, Boner.

1334
01:23:05,155 --> 01:23:07,430
Guys, guys, bath time.

1335
01:23:07,431 --> 01:23:09,085
Finally, brother.

1336
01:23:09,086 --> 01:23:12,119
My balls were about
to discover a new shade of blue.

1337
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,636
Holy crap.

1338
01:23:13,637 --> 01:23:15,154
I can't wait
to see those tits.

1339
01:23:15,155 --> 01:23:16,223
Yes.

1340
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:17,430
This is the biggest
day of my life.

1341
01:23:17,431 --> 01:23:18,741
Oh.

1342
01:23:20,879 --> 01:23:23,051
Come on, go ahead.

1343
01:23:25,362 --> 01:23:27,293
- Wow.
- Oh my God.

1344
01:23:31,155 --> 01:23:32,464
Hey. What is up?

1345
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:34,705
Dude, don't you like beer?

1346
01:23:34,706 --> 01:23:36,878
I just feel like a worm.

1347
01:23:36,879 --> 01:23:38,809
Man, we're
just having fun.

1348
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:40,050
I know, it's just...

1349
01:23:40,051 --> 01:23:41,809
She trusted me, man.
Just turn it off.

1350
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:44,602
We're going, we
're going, in a little while.

1351
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:46,188
Hey Brady, where
are you going, man?

1352
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:49,257
- Oh, fuck it.
- The Internet is amazing.

1353
01:23:49,258 --> 01:23:50,775
Yes.

1354
01:23:51,258 --> 01:23:52,843
Eww!

1355
01:23:52,844 --> 01:23:54,740
Hey, what? Is she bipartite?

1356
01:23:54,741 --> 01:23:56,740
- Brutal.
- I would still touch her.

1357
01:23:56,741 --> 01:23:58,603
contortionist.

1358
01:24:00,879 --> 01:24:02,671
a wig. I knew it.

1359
01:24:02,672 --> 01:24:04,189
I knew that.

1360
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,085
- Oh! Oh!
- What the hell is that?

1361
01:24:07,086 --> 01:24:08,533
Ah, ah.

1362
01:24:08,534 --> 01:24:10,362
Uh...

1363
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,878
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Is that that CGI thing?

1364
01:24:14,879 --> 01:24:16,292
Man, it's still...
It's still kind of hot.

1365
01:24:16,293 --> 01:24:18,395
I don't... I don't like it.
I do not like this.

1366
01:24:18,396 --> 01:24:19,636
Not.

1367
01:24:20,637 --> 01:24:22,947
fucking shit. People, she saw us.

1368
01:24:22,948 --> 01:24:24,223
Like, you need to call a

1369
01:24:24,224 --> 01:24:25,878
ambulance, the police
and then his parents.

1370
01:24:25,879 --> 01:24:27,326
- Call your parents.
- I understood.

1371
01:24:27,327 --> 01:24:29,085
911, what's your emergency?

1372
01:24:29,086 --> 01:24:32,223
Yes, I'm calling about
a girl with snakes on her head.

1373
01:24:32,224 --> 01:24:34,384
- How many snakes, sir?
- I don't know how many snakes!

1374
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,636
Holy crap.

1375
01:24:37,637 --> 01:24:38,843
Hey Hey. Did you hear that?

1376
01:24:38,844 --> 01:24:40,050
What was that?

1377
01:24:40,051 --> 01:24:42,775
Hey Hey.
She's on the roof, man.

1378
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:51,810
- What the hell is that?
- Oh!

1379
01:24:54,293 --> 01:24:55,706
Oh!

1380
01:24:58,534 --> 01:24:59,879
Oh no.

1381
01:25:02,637 --> 01:25:04,155
Oh my God!

1382
01:25:10,258 --> 01:25:11,844
Let's get out of here.

1383
01:25:14,534 --> 01:25:16,568
- What's up?
- Caution!

1384
01:25:19,568 --> 01:25:21,568
Go Go go go go!

1385
01:25:30,327 --> 01:25:32,447
Look, we need to get out,
we need to get out of here.

1386
01:25:33,431 --> 01:25:34,810
Brady.

1387
01:25:36,327 --> 01:25:38,085
S-Sandra?

1388
01:25:38,086 --> 01:25:41,567
We... we didn't mean to
hurt you, right?

1389
01:25:41,568 --> 01:25:43,430
Right, Dylan? We...

1390
01:25:43,431 --> 01:25:45,086
Oh my God...

1391
01:25:47,086 --> 01:25:48,774
No! Nobody can kill you!

1392
01:25:48,775 --> 01:25:51,155
Leave him alone!

1393
01:25:54,672 --> 01:25:57,293
No!

1394
01:26:29,396 --> 01:26:34,361
- Jane McAllister, 48...
- Sorry, wait for your release.

1395
01:26:34,362 --> 01:26:37,395
Jane McAllister, 48.

1396
01:26:37,396 --> 01:26:39,223
I understood.

1397
01:26:39,224 --> 01:26:42,809
This is where the vase
will be during the ritual.

1398
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:44,361
Are you nervous about everything?

1399
01:26:44,362 --> 01:26:46,636
No, I'm not part of the coven.

1400
01:26:46,637 --> 01:26:48,671
I'm just the husband
in the background.

1401
01:26:48,672 --> 01:26:50,982
But, yes, I'm nervous.

1402
01:26:52,155 --> 01:26:53,636
No.

1403
01:26:54,637 --> 01:26:56,257
Did you eat
anything before we left?

1404
01:26:56,258 --> 01:26:57,912
Yes, I got one of your Gogurts.

1405
01:26:57,913 --> 01:27:00,809
This is not a meal, man.

1406
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:02,326
I ate two of them.

1407
01:27:02,327 --> 01:27:04,705
So tell us why
you volunteered

1408
01:27:04,706 --> 01:27:06,326
to be the receptacle
and start saying

1409
01:27:06,327 --> 01:27:08,464
I volunteered to
be the receptacle because.

1410
01:27:08,465 --> 01:27:10,912
Um, I volunteered
to be the receptacle

1411
01:27:10,913 --> 01:27:13,223
because I always felt
that I was destined

1412
01:27:13,224 --> 01:27:15,705
for something bigger
than me, I think.

1413
01:27:15,706 --> 01:27:17,326
That makes sense?

1414
01:27:17,327 --> 01:27:19,740
And I just want to say,
it's an absolute honor

1415
01:27:19,741 --> 01:27:21,326
offer my body
as the earthly vessel

1416
01:27:21,327 --> 01:27:23,085
of Our Lord Ukabon.

1417
01:27:23,086 --> 01:27:25,085
Thank you very much, Kirsten.
Good luck tonight.

1418
01:27:25,086 --> 01:27:26,500
Yes, good luck or... yes.

1419
01:27:37,982 --> 01:27:39,395
Are you nervous to see one?

1420
01:27:39,396 --> 01:27:41,430
A demon?

1421
01:27:41,431 --> 01:27:44,533
You are on a trip.

1422
01:27:44,534 --> 01:27:46,327
Have you ever seen one?

1423
01:27:47,741 --> 01:27:50,671
Wait, I thought it would be
like New Year's Eve,

1424
01:27:50,672 --> 01:27:52,533
Y2K for the whole thing...

1425
01:27:52,534 --> 01:27:54,119
I mean, for
the big ones, yes.

1426
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:56,257
Julia, the book.

1427
01:27:56,258 --> 01:27:58,119
- I have to go.
- OK.

1428
01:27:58,120 --> 01:28:01,636
It is important to massage the
entrance to the other realm,

1429
01:28:01,637 --> 01:28:03,878
but let's not call
Ukabon into the vessel.

1430
01:28:03,879 --> 01:28:05,947
until the stroke of midnight,

1431
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:08,741
when the veil is thinnest.

1432
01:28:12,189 --> 01:28:13,500
Thanks.

1433
01:28:25,568 --> 01:28:27,395
- The window...
- The window.

1434
01:28:27,396 --> 01:28:29,533
- It starts to crack.
- To crack.

1435
01:28:29,534 --> 01:28:30,947
- The gate...
- Gate-

1436
01:28:30,948 --> 01:28:32,878
- starts to open.
- Open.

1437
01:28:32,879 --> 01:28:34,567
- The veil...
- The veil

1438
01:28:34,568 --> 01:28:36,395
- starts to slide.
- Slide.

1439
01:28:36,396 --> 01:28:37,810
- Ukabon
.

1440
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:39,636
- Ukabon
.

1441
01:28:39,637 --> 01:28:41,671
We put the
needle with your name

1442
01:28:41,672 --> 01:28:44,465
and we pull you to
our earth plane.

1443
01:28:48,396 --> 01:28:50,361
Troy.

1444
01:28:50,362 --> 01:28:51,603
faces.

1445
01:29:00,017 --> 01:29:03,257
- What was that.
- Which?

1446
01:29:03,258 --> 01:29:04,533
- Hey.
- Which?

1447
01:29:04,534 --> 01:29:05,879
I think I saw something.

1448
01:29:14,775 --> 01:29:16,879
Something is here!

1449
01:29:18,396 --> 01:29:20,223
Is that Fergus again?

1450
01:29:20,224 --> 01:29:21,740
I just expelled him, dear.

1451
01:29:21,741 --> 01:29:23,223
- Okay, follow my lead.
- Do not stop.

1452
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:26,050
- Let's talk to you without being invited.
- Troy, get in there.

1453
01:29:26,051 --> 01:29:27,085
Not invited.

1454
01:29:27,086 --> 01:29:29,119
Our anger thou hast kindled.

1455
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:30,671
lit.

1456
01:29:30,672 --> 01:29:32,602
All your power we...

1457
01:29:32,603 --> 01:29:33,774
No, no, no.

1458
01:29:33,775 --> 01:29:35,568
And I threw you back...

1459
01:29:45,603 --> 01:29:48,154
May?

1460
01:29:48,155 --> 01:29:49,568
May, I can't see.

1461
01:29:54,327 --> 01:29:56,878
May?

1462
01:29:56,879 --> 01:29:58,120
May?!

1463
01:30:17,568 --> 01:30:19,051
What?

1464
01:30:21,017 --> 01:30:23,809
May?

1465
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:25,188
Dude, how do we get out of here?

1466
01:30:25,189 --> 01:30:26,567
Oh, man, your head.

1467
01:30:26,568 --> 01:30:28,602
Wow, stop, look at this.

1468
01:30:28,603 --> 01:30:29,879
Oh shit.

1469
01:30:31,948 --> 01:30:34,672
- What the hell?
- What is that?

1470
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,637
Hey, what's going on?

1471
01:30:43,741 --> 01:30:45,534
- Dude, what is this?
- Is that a person?

1472
01:30:47,431 --> 01:30:48,672
No!

1473
01:30:53,431 --> 01:30:55,361
Oh oh oh! Oh!

1474
01:30:55,362 --> 01:30:56,741
Oh shit!

1475
01:31:03,189 --> 01:31:05,395
What was this? What was this?

1476
01:31:05,396 --> 01:31:07,292
Shh, shh! Turn off the light!

1477
01:31:07,293 --> 01:31:08,636
Turn it off!

1478
01:31:08,637 --> 01:31:11,395
Where's the button?

1479
01:31:11,396 --> 01:31:12,568
Shh, be still!

1480
01:31:18,706 --> 01:31:20,085
Something licked my hand.

1481
01:31:20,086 --> 01:31:21,878
- Which?
- Something licked my hand.

1482
01:31:21,879 --> 01:31:23,326
- Nothing licked your hand.
- No, I'm serious.

1483
01:31:23,327 --> 01:31:24,912
shut up. I do not care.

1484
01:31:24,913 --> 01:31:26,844
shut up. Don't turn on the light.

1485
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,326
oh what?

1486
01:31:32,327 --> 01:31:34,224
Have Jesus.

1487
01:31:52,568 --> 01:31:53,774
Oh my God.

1488
01:31:53,775 --> 01:31:55,326
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

1489
01:31:55,327 --> 01:31:56,774
We are not Hell.

1490
01:31:56,775 --> 01:31:58,740
I shouldn't be in hell!

1491
01:31:58,741 --> 01:32:00,671
Stop panicking!

1492
01:32:00,672 --> 01:32:02,809
I shouldn't be here.
I go to church.

1493
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:05,154
Listen to me, there is no such
thing as hell. OK?

1494
01:32:05,155 --> 01:32:08,292
- And you don't even go to church.
- Help!

1495
01:32:08,293 --> 01:32:10,085
Stay down.

1496
01:32:10,086 --> 01:32:12,567
- Hey!
- Oh shit! He saw me.

1497
01:32:12,568 --> 01:32:15,257
- Troy, shut up.
- Oh Merda.

1498
01:32:15,258 --> 01:32:17,119
What are you doing?

1499
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:20,258
Is coming.
What are we going to do, Nate?

1500
01:32:25,672 --> 01:32:29,774
Wait!
Madam, wait! Wait!

1501
01:32:29,775 --> 01:32:32,154
My friend and I are lost.
We don't know where we are.

1502
01:32:32,155 --> 01:32:34,705
You are in the feeding camps.

1503
01:32:34,706 --> 01:32:36,395
What is the eating area?

1504
01:32:36,396 --> 01:32:37,567
To area...

1505
01:32:37,568 --> 01:32:41,567
Oh, you're cool.

1506
01:32:41,568 --> 01:32:44,567
What great sin did you commit?

1507
01:32:44,568 --> 01:32:47,223
I told you!

1508
01:32:47,224 --> 01:32:50,292
Look, miss, my
friend and I didn't do anything wrong.

1509
01:32:50,293 --> 01:32:53,154
Oh, of course not.

1510
01:32:53,155 --> 01:32:56,499
No, we really don't.
I don't think we died.

1511
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,843
We were doing a ritual

1512
01:32:57,844 --> 01:32:59,602
with an old book
and everything went wrong.

1513
01:32:59,603 --> 01:33:00,947
Book? Which book?

1514
01:33:00,948 --> 01:33:03,223
Troy, I think when
those witches sent that

1515
01:33:03,224 --> 01:33:06,774
demonic thing here,
we accidentally came with it.

1516
01:33:06,775 --> 01:33:08,567
It is possible? These
witches were trying

1517
01:33:08,568 --> 01:33:10,947
summon a powerful
demon into a woman's body.

1518
01:33:10,948 --> 01:33:13,154
Which name?
What name did they try to invoke?

1519
01:33:13,155 --> 01:33:15,016
Shit, I don't remember.
Something like...

1520
01:33:15,017 --> 01:33:19,395
It was like Qui-Gon or
Pokemon or some shit like that.

1521
01:33:19,396 --> 01:33:21,188
The book on the Order of Blood?

1522
01:33:21,189 --> 01:33:22,636
Yea! Do you know him?

1523
01:33:22,637 --> 01:33:25,499
Yup. Oh, I hate Ukabon!

1524
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,948
You are not far from him.

1525
01:33:33,603 --> 01:33:35,016
Eight minutes.

1526
01:33:35,017 --> 01:33:36,705
Troy, what we need
is this Ukabon at

1527
01:33:36,706 --> 01:33:38,223
midnight when the
witches take you across the valley.

1528
01:33:38,224 --> 01:33:40,085
Oh yeah! And then
we can grab it like this

1529
01:33:40,086 --> 01:33:42,050
take it, and
we can go home!

1530
01:33:42,051 --> 01:33:43,809
Yes.

1531
01:33:43,810 --> 01:33:47,912
Can you please
take us to Ukabon?

1532
01:33:47,913 --> 01:33:49,843
We only have eight minutes,
shit, seven minutes now.

1533
01:33:49,844 --> 01:33:52,671
If I return you
to Earth, you will write

1534
01:33:52,672 --> 01:33:54,430
my name in the Great
Book of Witches?

1535
01:33:54,431 --> 01:33:55,533
Yes sure.

1536
01:33:55,534 --> 01:33:58,016
My name is Mabel the
Skull Biter.

1537
01:33:58,017 --> 01:34:01,774
I took command of 30 legions.

1538
01:34:01,775 --> 01:34:03,706
Hurry, run!

1539
01:34:08,258 --> 01:34:09,293
This way.

1540
01:34:15,672 --> 01:34:17,293
- What are you doing?
- Continues.

1541
01:34:23,568 --> 01:34:25,774
Shh!

1542
01:34:25,775 --> 01:34:28,326
I nearly ruined
my hand on these stakes.

1543
01:34:28,327 --> 01:34:29,948
Come here.

1544
01:34:37,086 --> 01:34:39,154
Hey Mabel, you might
have been to hell for

1545
01:34:39,155 --> 01:34:41,292
cause of an isolated shoplifting ?

1546
01:34:41,293 --> 01:34:43,705
Oh yes, Troy, that's the
worst thing you've ever done.

1547
01:34:43,706 --> 01:34:45,913
- What does this mean?
- Shut up.

1548
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:52,154
No, seriously.
What does this mean?

1549
01:34:52,155 --> 01:34:53,774
- Cale-se!
- Shh!

1550
01:34:53,775 --> 01:34:57,568
Remember, fresh souls
are tastier.

1551
01:35:15,465 --> 01:35:18,947
Mabel, take it slow.

1552
01:35:18,948 --> 01:35:21,326
Man, what if she
's taking us to, like,

1553
01:35:21,327 --> 01:35:23,223
one of your little
demon friends or something?

1554
01:35:23,224 --> 01:35:24,361
No I do not think.

1555
01:35:24,362 --> 01:35:26,465
I'm a good judge of people.

1556
01:35:29,568 --> 01:35:31,085
No... Oh, sorry.

1557
01:35:31,086 --> 01:35:32,465
No, don't get involved.

1558
01:35:35,948 --> 01:35:38,051
Hey, keep going.
We're going to lose Mabel.

1559
01:35:40,913 --> 01:35:42,912
Why are you standing still, bro?
Go! Go! Go!

1560
01:35:42,913 --> 01:35:45,120
Ok!

1561
01:35:46,431 --> 01:35:47,809
- Mabel!
- Oh dear.

1562
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:50,500
I almost stepped into that
huge trap.

1563
01:35:57,327 --> 01:35:59,637
- Oh!
- Nate, my hand!

1564
01:36:01,706 --> 01:36:04,430
Where?

1565
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:06,775
Mabel, my hand!

1566
01:36:11,155 --> 01:36:13,017
They! It seems!

1567
01:36:15,534 --> 01:36:17,223
Why are you raising your voice?

1568
01:36:17,224 --> 01:36:21,050
Maybe because you're
leading us to our deaths.

1569
01:36:21,051 --> 01:36:23,740
Where the hell
are you taking us?

1570
01:36:23,741 --> 01:36:26,119
Nobody talks to me like that.

1571
01:36:26,120 --> 01:36:27,705
In this world, I give the orders!

1572
01:36:27,706 --> 01:36:29,085
I am nobody's servant!

1573
01:36:29,086 --> 01:36:34,705
Grand Order, return it to me immediately!

1574
01:36:34,706 --> 01:36:36,671
Mabel!

1575
01:36:36,672 --> 01:36:38,534
Mabel!

1576
01:36:40,396 --> 01:36:42,981
Mabel! Mabel!

1577
01:36:42,982 --> 01:36:45,257
Come back here, you stupid bitch!

1578
01:36:45,258 --> 01:36:46,947
We are lost.

1579
01:36:46,948 --> 01:36:49,947
Nate, get the light.
Let me have this.

1580
01:36:49,948 --> 01:36:51,774
What? Not.
You don't know how to fight.

1581
01:36:51,775 --> 01:36:53,809
Yes I know.
I did martial arts.

1582
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:56,085
- No you did not.
- When I was a kid I did.

1583
01:36:56,086 --> 01:36:57,534
Troy, I barely got... Ah, shit!

1584
01:37:01,913 --> 01:37:03,120
Let's go!

1585
01:37:06,293 --> 01:37:09,567
I'll stab you
in the face with this thing!

1586
01:37:09,568 --> 01:37:11,912
Oh shit, Troy! Troy,
we're making sem tempo, cara!

1587
01:37:11,913 --> 01:37:13,292
She just left us here!

1588
01:37:13,293 --> 01:37:15,292
Maybe you
shouldn't have been such an idiot!

1589
01:37:15,293 --> 01:37:17,567
Well shit, Troy, I
'm sorry I'm no friend-friend

1590
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:20,533
with every hellish demon
I meet.

1591
01:37:20,534 --> 01:37:22,257
That's called leadership, Troy.

1592
01:37:22,258 --> 01:37:23,809
Someone has to take charge.

1593
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:25,430
It won't be you.

1594
01:37:25,431 --> 01:37:29,567
Well, Mabel and I respond
to a different leadership style!

1595
01:37:29,568 --> 01:37:31,292
Help me!

1596
01:37:31,293 --> 01:37:33,395
Mabel!

1597
01:37:33,396 --> 01:37:36,085
Troy, no!

1598
01:37:36,086 --> 01:37:39,223
Troy, pare!

1599
01:37:39,224 --> 01:37:40,602
Mabel.

1600
01:37:40,603 --> 01:37:42,119
help me.

1601
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:43,326
Oh help.

1602
01:37:43,327 --> 01:37:45,567
Uh...

1603
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:47,293
Madam?

1604
01:37:50,982 --> 01:37:52,155
Run Nate!

1605
01:37:57,155 --> 01:37:58,912
Why do you scream like cowards?

1606
01:37:58,913 --> 01:38:00,671
Because there was a
woman and then there was...

1607
01:38:00,672 --> 01:38:02,326
She needed help, but
she... her arms were...

1608
01:38:02,327 --> 01:38:06,051
Oh, you've met her.

1609
01:38:11,741 --> 01:38:13,879
They already got me.

1610
01:38:18,637 --> 01:38:21,016
Shit, dear.

1611
01:38:21,017 --> 01:38:24,188
We only have four minutes.
We won't make it.

1612
01:38:24,189 --> 01:38:26,292
Men, we are here.

1613
01:38:26,293 --> 01:38:29,603
Here is the back entrance to the
Ukabon residence.

1614
01:38:35,258 --> 01:38:40,016
Here, where Worm has gone about
his business, you must grovel.

1615
01:38:40,017 --> 01:38:43,085
- Troy, you go first.
- No.

1616
01:38:43,086 --> 01:38:44,533
I only have one good hand.
I can't go hold the light.

1617
01:38:44,534 --> 01:38:45,947
We need the light.

1618
01:38:45,948 --> 01:38:47,740
I can't hold the light
and crawl at the same time...

1619
01:38:47,741 --> 01:38:50,567
I will fix your torch to your head.

1620
01:38:50,568 --> 01:38:53,636
Wait what? Not. Brutal.

1621
01:38:53,637 --> 01:38:55,155
Nate?

1622
01:38:57,362 --> 01:38:59,603
Oh face.

1623
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:07,742
Get in soon Go, go,
go, go! Go! Go! Go!

1624
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:13,395
Go! Go! Go!

1625
01:39:13,396 --> 01:39:14,843
Troy, faster!

1626
01:39:14,844 --> 01:39:16,810
I'm trying, Nate!

1627
01:39:31,672 --> 01:39:34,085
What is it?!

1628
01:39:34,086 --> 01:39:37,120
Shh. Calm down, men.

1629
01:39:56,396 --> 01:39:58,361
Man, you just pushed me
into that creature thing!

1630
01:39:58,362 --> 01:40:01,154
No, I didn't.
It was a reflex.

1631
01:40:01,155 --> 01:40:02,464
Stop acting like
I'm a bad person.

1632
01:40:02,465 --> 01:40:03,810
Shh!

1633
01:40:17,120 --> 01:40:18,293
I'll borrow it!

1634
01:40:42,568 --> 01:40:43,843
80 seconds.

1635
01:40:43,844 --> 01:40:45,602
I say we're going straight
to Ukabon 60s.

1636
01:40:45,603 --> 01:40:47,051
OK.

1637
01:40:49,051 --> 01:40:50,636
Nate, do you really think
I'm a bad person?

1638
01:40:50,637 --> 01:40:52,085
You can't be serious right now.

1639
01:40:52,086 --> 01:40:53,774
Well excuse me for thinking
it's a big problem that

1640
01:40:53,775 --> 01:40:55,016
my best friend thinks
i'm a terrible person.

1641
01:40:55,017 --> 01:40:57,085
- Shh!
- Ok, Nate, I barely got the hang of it.

1642
01:40:57,086 --> 01:41:00,292
and ignore me like
you always do.

1643
01:41:00,293 --> 01:41:02,705
You told my ex that I
have a gambling addiction.

1644
01:41:02,706 --> 01:41:04,223
Two years ago.

1645
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:05,981
I was just trying to
make her feel better.

1646
01:41:05,982 --> 01:41:08,705
You never protect me, Troy.

1647
01:41:08,706 --> 01:41:11,500
Shit, 58 seconds. Come on.

1648
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:20,671
Don't forget to
write my name in the book!

1649
01:41:20,672 --> 01:41:22,431
Oh shit!

1650
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:26,705
Almost, Troy. We will!

1651
01:41:26,706 --> 01:41:28,982
Nathan, watch out!

1652
01:41:32,568 --> 01:41:34,258
Troy, go!

1653
01:41:53,362 --> 01:41:54,637
Balls!

1654
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:07,947
- It's close now.
- It's close now.

1655
01:42:07,948 --> 01:42:10,120
- It's close now.
- It's close now.

1656
01:42:10,189 --> 01:42:12,155
- It's close now.
- It's close now.

1657
01:42:13,775 --> 01:42:16,189
- It's close now.
- It's close now.

1658
01:42:16,258 --> 01:42:18,018
- It's close now.
- It's close now.

1659
01:42:31,189 --> 01:42:32,533
15 seconds.

1660
01:42:32,534 --> 01:42:35,602
Wait! Mabel!

1661
01:42:35,603 --> 01:42:37,050
Come with us!

1662
01:42:37,051 --> 01:42:38,292
Ukabon Ukabon.

1663
01:42:38,293 --> 01:42:41,567
Ukabon. Ukabon. Ukabon.

1664
01:42:41,568 --> 01:42:43,464
Write my name!

1665
01:42:43,465 --> 01:42:45,982
Just go, go, go!

1666
01:42:52,568 --> 01:42:53,843
He is coming!

1667
01:42:53,844 --> 01:42:55,912
Troy!

1668
01:42:55,913 --> 01:42:58,602
Troy, we got us!

1669
01:42:58,603 --> 01:43:01,292
W-wait, why...
why am I tied up?

1670
01:43:01,293 --> 01:43:03,809
Nate, Nate, Nate!

1671
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:06,636
- No!
- Nate!

1672
01:43:06,637 --> 01:43:08,224
What are you doing?

1673
01:43:11,155 --> 01:43:13,085
How did this happen?

1674
01:43:13,086 --> 01:43:16,085
- How did this happen?!
- Just try again.

1675
01:43:16,086 --> 01:43:18,533
Do you think we can do
it again, just do it again?

1676
01:43:18,534 --> 01:43:19,878
Well, we can't! We can not!

1677
01:43:19,879 --> 01:43:21,499
It's all in the book, honey.

1678
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,809
How did you let this happen?

1679
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:24,671
Well, the film crew
wasn't my idea.

1680
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:26,636
Will you blame me now?

1681
01:43:26,637 --> 01:43:28,188
I cleaned for you.
I prepare for you.

1682
01:43:28,189 --> 01:43:30,602
I do everything for you, and this is
how you thank me?

1683
01:43:30,603 --> 01:43:31,809
- Be quiet!
- Blame me?

1684
01:43:31,810 --> 01:43:33,085
You should have listened to me.

1685
01:43:33,086 --> 01:43:36,292
shut up. Julia, where are you going?

1686
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:37,913
I'll get a mop.
