1
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,886
- Oliver!
- Yeah.

2
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,755
Can you get me the big cutters?

3
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:34,355
- You got it.
- Thanks.

4
00:03:35,617 --> 00:03:37,485
Accessing underground structure.

5
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,855
- Feeds are live.
- Got it.

6
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:41,395
We're in.

7
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,124
Wait until the asset
gives the all clear.

8
00:03:43,149 --> 00:03:44,455
Copy.

9
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,616
- Take some pictures.
- Roger.

10
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:49,297
Getting imagery now.

11
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,866
And of the nuclear facility.

12
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:53,334
Look at that, they got the
whole thing underground.

13
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,937
Even the chimneys are hidden.

14
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,384
Come on Oliver,
let's wrap it up.

15
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:12,880
Show me what you did!

16
00:04:13,956 --> 00:04:15,256
Hey!

17
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:18,694
Hey, I'm talking to you.

18
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:20,263
Show me what you did!

19
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:21,797
Hey, hey!

20
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:25,810
We're almost done
here. Almost done!

21
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:29,021
He needs to show us,
what he was doing

22
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,610
You've seen our paperwork.

23
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:37,079
Which is working on
the telephone lines...

24
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:40,700
The internet... better
connectivity for the city of Qom.

25
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,619
He's a spy.

26
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,122
A pig!

27
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:48,422
No, no, no!

28
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,626
He's just quiet, he
doesn't talk much.

29
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:55,464
We call Quds Force.

30
00:04:59,427 --> 00:05:02,263
We were hired by
your Government.

31
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:03,639
By the Ayatollah.

32
00:05:04,773 --> 00:05:05,773
Hey, hey!

33
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,846
Scan all frequencies.

34
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:12,446
Any charter back to Tehran?

35
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,448
Negative, no radio
transmissions.

36
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:17,686
It's okay.

37
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:18,854
Just my phone.

38
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,324
Look.

39
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:26,494
See?

40
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,998
Come here.

41
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:37,438
Look, see? Come here.

42
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,373
Now you got fast internet.

43
00:05:40,776 --> 00:05:41,777
Ey?

44
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:45,647
Still want to call Quds Force?

45
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:50,451
Come here. Come here.

46
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,988
Come here, watch.

47
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:54,355
Football.

48
00:05:57,826 --> 00:05:58,961
See?

49
00:05:58,994 --> 00:06:00,662
It's a goal!

50
00:06:01,964 --> 00:06:03,599
Yeah.

51
00:06:03,632 --> 00:06:05,868
It's a goal! Incredible...

52
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:22,160
They just pulled
away from the sight.

53
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:23,652
Keep eyes in the sky on them.

54
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,161
You think they're onto us?

55
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:35,396
We're not hanging
from a crane yet.

56
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,702
Don't worry, our cover's
tight, we're good.

57
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:42,604
I'm ready for this
one to be over.

58
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,643
Watching right up.

59
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:49,912
UAVs and drones on standby.

60
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:50,946
Maneuver's a go.

61
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:51,979
Execute.

62
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:55,517
Breaching firewall.

63
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,819
System running at 95%.

64
00:06:57,853 --> 00:07:00,555
Confirm the alarms are
disabled in centrifuge room.

65
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,557
Confirming, alarms disabled.

66
00:07:05,227 --> 00:07:07,062
Eyes on guard,
still no movement.

67
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:09,531
The Trojan horse is active,
and we are undetected.

68
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:11,033
Copy, no detection.

69
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,167
We're in the mainframe now.

70
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,069
How much time?

71
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:17,205
Ten hours until it
hits the centrifuges.

72
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,607
Twelve until meltdown.

73
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,876
Continue monitoring the CCTV.

74
00:07:20,909 --> 00:07:21,977
Copy.

75
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:24,613
Three, two, one.

76
00:07:24,646 --> 00:07:27,049
I'm Luna Kujai, and this
is your Middle East update

77
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:28,617
broadcasting live from Oman.

78
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,953
Tensions continue
after Iran's decision

79
00:07:30,986 --> 00:07:34,488
to abandon nuclear negotiations
with Western powers.

80
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:37,059
Still no boots on the ground,
as promised by the US.

81
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,862
Three, two, one.

82
00:07:40,896 --> 00:07:43,265
Still no boots on the
ground, as promised by the US

83
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:45,499
and its allies, after
their withdrawal

84
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:47,903
of conventional
forces in Afghanistan.

85
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:50,105
Yet the shadow war wages on.

86
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:53,175
Elite American and British
units continue to hunt down

87
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:55,877
high value targets in
denied territories.

88
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:59,514
In the last month alone, the
assassinations of two Iranian

89
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:02,150
nuclear scientists and
a top Al-Qaeda leader...

90
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:21,937
James, James, what do I do now?

91
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,772
Okay, I'm sending the file.

92
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:25,607
Open the key to
encrypt the connection

93
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,975
point to point, we gotta hurry.

94
00:08:37,052 --> 00:08:38,553
Oh, my God!

95
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:42,157
This exposes their
entire operations.

96
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,026
And that's why we got
to be careful okay.

97
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,828
But no names, you hear me?
Okay? Protect the assets.

98
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:49,164
Yes, I promise, I promise,
just, just the companies,

99
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:50,932
the CIA is using
for cover, right?

100
00:08:50,966 --> 00:08:52,789
I just want them to
know I'm a patriot

101
00:08:52,814 --> 00:08:54,332
that I'm protecting my country,
that's why I'm doing this.

102
00:08:54,356 --> 00:08:55,433
Yeah.

103
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,926
Wait, someone's
coming, I gotta go.

104
00:08:56,951 --> 00:08:57,951
James?

105
00:09:02,978 --> 00:09:05,147
Der Herald Newspaper, how
may I assist your call?

106
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,948
Hi, this is Luna Kujai.

107
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:09,317
Please connect me to
Hans Forzburg's office.

108
00:09:09,351 --> 00:09:11,031
Uh, yeah, yeah, tell
him it's an emergency.

109
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:15,385
- Luna, what have you got?
- Hello, Hans?

110
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,105
My Pentagon source
just came through.

111
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,369
Can we verify the information?

112
00:09:18,393 --> 00:09:20,978
Yeah. The CIA's Black Ops.

113
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:22,631
Jesus, are you sure?

114
00:09:22,664 --> 00:09:24,132
Yeah, trust me.

115
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,169
It'll be bigger than Snowden
and WikiLeaks combined.

116
00:09:27,202 --> 00:09:28,603
Fantastic work, Luna.

117
00:09:28,637 --> 00:09:29,938
You're exposing the Hypocrisy

118
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:31,840
and we're going
front page with it.

119
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:53,221
I'll call Langley,
make sure we're on.

120
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:54,689
We better be.

121
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:55,891
Some maintenance guy checks

122
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:58,026
that junction box, we're fucked.

123
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:40,335
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

124
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:43,271
Huh, every time you call,
it's from a different number.

125
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:46,875
Listen, I get in late
tomorrow night to Gatwick.

126
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:49,211
I'll call you if my
flight's delayed, alright?

127
00:11:49,244 --> 00:11:51,780
And make sure you're on
the plane this time, Tom.

128
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:53,157
'Cause Ida's already
told her friends that her

129
00:11:53,181 --> 00:11:55,150
fucking dad will be
there for her graduation.

130
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:57,085
Alright, don't start, Cory.

131
00:11:57,118 --> 00:11:59,955
I mean you know, the
job dictates everything.

132
00:11:59,988 --> 00:12:02,324
Well, you know what, you
need to dictate it this time

133
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:04,025
or you're gonna break her heart.

134
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,964
And... I... I also need
you to sign the papers.

135
00:12:10,398 --> 00:12:12,400
And, I suppose I
could finally move on.

136
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:17,839
Are you seeing somebody?

137
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:19,107
Yeah, I am.

138
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,143
Is this serious?

139
00:12:22,177 --> 00:12:24,813
I just want to stop
living in this purgatory.

140
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:27,249
You know what I mean,
look at your things.

141
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:29,117
They're all over the flat.

142
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,086
I'll do whatever
you need, alright?

143
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,121
I just...

144
00:12:33,154 --> 00:12:35,257
I want you to be happy.

145
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,993
Sure you're gonna go right back
there after the graduation.

146
00:12:38,026 --> 00:12:40,862
- You'll never quit.
- I...

147
00:12:40,895 --> 00:12:42,964
- Admit it.
- What do you want from me?

148
00:12:42,998 --> 00:12:46,034
I mean, I don't have anything
else on my resume, do I?

149
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:47,570
You know you can teach.

150
00:12:47,603 --> 00:12:49,871
- Teach?
- Yeah, teach.

151
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:51,906
Y... you've got the degree.

152
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,908
I'm not really that interested

153
00:12:53,942 --> 00:12:55,877
in sitting behind
a desk all day.

154
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:05,086
- I'm sorry, Cory.
- Okay.

155
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,822
- About everything.
- Just...

156
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:09,391
Just please be safe, will you?

157
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:14,129
And please be on that flight.

158
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:15,162
Okay.

159
00:13:40,573 --> 00:13:41,991
Next.

160
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:56,464
Place your fingers on there.

161
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:09,100
What's your business
in the Islamic Emirate?

162
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:11,437
I'm working with
the Red Crescent...

163
00:14:12,271 --> 00:14:13,981
Drought relief.

164
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:35,752
Do not take pictures.

165
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:37,171
You are to obey Sharia law.

166
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:12,180
Yeah.

167
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:17,520
Hello?

168
00:15:17,553 --> 00:15:19,287
It is good to hear your voice.

169
00:15:20,756 --> 00:15:22,625
Any problems getting
in the country?

170
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:25,561
No, they bought the cover story.

171
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:28,496
And my fingerprints weren't
in the system, like you said.

172
00:15:28,531 --> 00:15:30,064
You know I got you back.

173
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:32,066
But still, you
got to be careful.

174
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,035
If they find out who
you really are...

175
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:36,204
I know the risk, Roman.

176
00:15:36,237 --> 00:15:37,673
Trust me.

177
00:15:37,706 --> 00:15:40,041
But I said I will do
this job, and I will.

178
00:15:40,074 --> 00:15:42,043
I know you would.

179
00:15:42,076 --> 00:15:44,279
That's why I got
that info you wanted.

180
00:15:45,246 --> 00:15:47,081
Nahal Hosseini.

181
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:48,517
I'll text you her number.

182
00:15:48,551 --> 00:15:50,452
Thank you, thanks.

183
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:52,420
When does your
friends come here?

184
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,690
Day after tomorrow.

185
00:15:54,723 --> 00:15:58,059
Roman, it's just a
translating job, right?

186
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,662
Just translating, yes.

187
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:03,064
Okay, I got to go.

188
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:43,438
Status?

189
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:45,774
Centrifuges are at
temperature, sir.

190
00:16:45,808 --> 00:16:47,543
Distributing
variable spin speed.

191
00:16:47,576 --> 00:16:48,711
It's moving up now.

192
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:50,679
Increasing to 70,000 rpm.

193
00:16:50,713 --> 00:16:52,781
- Do they know we're in?
- No, sir.

194
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:54,349
We're still clean.

195
00:16:54,382 --> 00:16:55,651
Do it.

196
00:16:55,684 --> 00:16:57,151
Is everyone at their stations?

197
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:59,320
Increasing speeds to 90,000 rpm.

198
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,792
Tracking pressure increase
in reactive space.

199
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,531
Temperature continuing to rise.

200
00:17:08,564 --> 00:17:10,198
Now at 800 degrees.

201
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:13,802
They manually triggered
their emergency alarms.

202
00:17:17,305 --> 00:17:19,374
They triggered the
halon gas system.

203
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:24,607
Luckily most of the radiation...
is trapped underground.

204
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:28,402
The Supreme Leader
thinks we look weak.

205
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,821
Especially after Natanz.

206
00:18:31,822 --> 00:18:34,784
He wants a public execution
for the person responsible

207
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:38,996
Only the Americans or
Israelis, have this capability.

208
00:18:40,248 --> 00:18:42,667
Yes, the problem is proving it.

209
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:52,677
We're monitoring a journalist...

210
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,431
She received classified files,

211
00:18:58,057 --> 00:19:00,977
on all CIA operations
in the Middle East.

212
00:19:05,064 --> 00:19:07,275
Do whatever it takes, Farzad.

213
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:09,318
And do it quick.

214
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,423
Alright, I'm off to the airport.

215
00:19:48,456 --> 00:19:50,526
- Anything from Roman?
- All clean.

216
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,394
Alright, make sure...
clean out the house.

217
00:19:53,428 --> 00:19:55,698
Wipe down all the
hard drives, ey?

218
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:57,465
- Full burn down.
- You got it.

219
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:01,469
Say hello to the
free world for me.

220
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:04,439
Take care.

221
00:20:21,432 --> 00:20:24,769
The Northern Alliance
conducted raids in Sheberghan.

222
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:29,232
They're massing a small
force outside of Kunduz.

223
00:20:30,191 --> 00:20:33,778
We need more ammunition
for the M4s and rockets

224
00:20:34,368 --> 00:20:37,606
How the fuck can you be
running out of ammunition?

225
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:39,541
When the Americans
left you with it?

226
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:43,478
That was a long time ago, Kahil,
we're also fighting Daesh.

227
00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:46,749
New ISISK fighters coming in
from the Gulf every single day.

228
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,126
I want to talk about
the killings...

229
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:51,128
in Herat, the teachers.

230
00:20:51,504 --> 00:20:52,713
Re-educating the population...

231
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:55,424
in the old ways.

232
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:58,938
Set forth by Mullah Omar.

233
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:00,832
Mullah Omar is dead.

234
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:02,893
Done gone, now what?

235
00:21:02,998 --> 00:21:05,534
I know they don't understand
a word I'm saying right now.

236
00:21:06,602 --> 00:21:08,469
But you better.

237
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:10,739
Can't have you pull this
crazy shit all over again.

238
00:21:13,776 --> 00:21:15,476
Chopping heads off.

239
00:21:16,945 --> 00:21:19,047
Beating women in public.

240
00:21:19,081 --> 00:21:21,449
Taking selfies.

241
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:23,085
The world is watching.

242
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:26,021
And you have to show them
that you are modernizing.

243
00:21:26,054 --> 00:21:29,625
Because I can't have my
leaders face sanctions.

244
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:32,795
But what you're worried
about is the dangers

245
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:34,663
of little girls going to school.

246
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:37,099
I'm not worried about
little girls in schools.

247
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:38,100
Then what're you worried about?

248
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:41,036
Traitors, Kahil, traitors.

249
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:43,605
You continue this revenge shit.

250
00:21:44,907 --> 00:21:47,408
There will be no
sanctuary for you

251
00:21:47,441 --> 00:21:50,478
or anyone of you
anywhere in Pakistan.

252
00:21:50,512 --> 00:21:52,681
Because the Americans
will come again.

253
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:56,552
And they will bomb the
fuck out of you, again.

254
00:21:56,585 --> 00:21:58,105
So you'll be running
around in circles.

255
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,791
You've been given
a gift from God.

256
00:22:12,209 --> 00:22:15,879
You've slayed...
the American dragon.

257
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,508
Now you must focus on
reuniting your people.

258
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:24,639
So the Caliphate... like a
seed in the wind can spread.

259
00:22:26,015 --> 00:22:27,350
Very good.

260
00:22:33,655 --> 00:22:36,457
Remember who put you
in that chair, Rasoul.

261
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,493
Who made you, who protected you

262
00:22:39,528 --> 00:22:41,864
when you were being fucked hard.

263
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:55,143
<i>Salaam Alaikum.</i>

264
00:22:55,336 --> 00:22:57,170
How did the meeting go?

265
00:22:57,171 --> 00:22:59,381
Sir, they've all gone mad.

266
00:22:59,382 --> 00:23:00,967
Times have changed...

267
00:23:01,884 --> 00:23:03,761
and these guys are still
living in the past.

268
00:23:04,595 --> 00:23:07,223
As long as they keep
their backs to India.

269
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:10,977
Did you see the news?

270
00:23:11,352 --> 00:23:14,188
Someone burned down
Iran's crown jewel.

271
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,276
Be ready... your
country may need you.

272
00:23:19,151 --> 00:23:20,361
Yes, sir.

273
00:23:41,823 --> 00:23:43,792
<i>As the United States, Israel</i>

274
00:23:43,825 --> 00:23:46,094
and other Western
powers continue to deny

275
00:23:46,128 --> 00:23:47,729
any involvement in the sabotage

276
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:50,132
of Iran's nuclear
reactor today near Kam

277
00:23:50,165 --> 00:23:52,634
there are still no suspects.

278
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:55,871
Many are reminded of Stuxnet,
the malicious computer virus

279
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,941
that caused the centrifuge
meltdown of their tanks facility

280
00:23:58,974 --> 00:24:01,610
that incident followed on
for many other incidents...

281
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:57,866
<i>Are you still coming
home tomorrow?</i>

282
00:24:57,899 --> 00:25:01,670
No, Mr. Hans wants me
in Berlin first thing.

283
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:04,239
Oh, wait, so you're
going to Berlin?

284
00:25:04,272 --> 00:25:06,575
Yeah, I have to
supervise the edit.

285
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:08,276
Well, Lilly and I are
sure proud of you.

286
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,212
- You did it.
- Oh, thanks, love.

287
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:11,980
I miss you both so much.

288
00:25:14,016 --> 00:25:15,984
- Has she been good?
- Yeah, she's been...

289
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:18,220
Wait, w... w... what?

290
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:21,023
Help! Help me!

291
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:22,290
Are you okay?

292
00:25:22,324 --> 00:25:23,592
- Help!
- What's going on?

293
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:25,160
Answer me! Luna!

294
00:25:25,193 --> 00:25:26,628
- Help!
- I'll call the police!

295
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:49,678
Whoa! There he is!

296
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:52,380
Ah! Bring it in!

297
00:26:52,414 --> 00:26:53,849
- How are you?
- Fine.

298
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,719
Come on, let's get you a drink.

299
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,726
Good to see you
all in one piece.

300
00:27:13,401 --> 00:27:15,137
It's all for show.

301
00:27:15,971 --> 00:27:18,006
The usual?

302
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:30,152
Cheers!

303
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:32,687
Sick and tired of
working in this cesspool

304
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:34,389
while looking for
the American dream.

305
00:27:34,422 --> 00:27:36,892
Yeah, why am I here, Roman?

306
00:27:37,726 --> 00:27:39,694
Your flight was delayed.

307
00:27:39,728 --> 00:27:41,163
Well, I know.

308
00:27:42,264 --> 00:27:44,933
It leaves in 92 minutes.

309
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:46,768
Hmm.

310
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:48,336
I'm gonna push it back again!

311
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:54,074
Come with me.

312
00:27:55,477 --> 00:27:57,345
And they said it
couldn't be done.

313
00:27:57,379 --> 00:27:58,947
My favorite horse...

314
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:01,383
always delivers.

315
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,051
Yeah, they'll just
build another one.

316
00:28:03,084 --> 00:28:04,953
Of course they will.

317
00:28:04,986 --> 00:28:07,455
And that's why I need
you for the next phase.

318
00:28:07,489 --> 00:28:08,757
Yeah, when I get back.

319
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,060
No, no, this one can't wait.

320
00:28:12,093 --> 00:28:13,228
Come upstairs.

321
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:18,967
I don't know, you just
tell me when to stop.

322
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,206
I told you, Roman.

323
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:27,075
When I get back.

324
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:29,010
Job starts tomorrow,
three days work.

325
00:28:29,044 --> 00:28:31,379
You'll be back in time
for Ida's graduation.

326
00:28:31,413 --> 00:28:33,815
Oh, are you tapping
my phones now?

327
00:28:33,848 --> 00:28:36,084
This job is making you paranoid.

328
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:39,087
You're gonna sign
those divorce papers?

329
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,956
Stay out my fucking
personal life, alright?

330
00:28:40,989 --> 00:28:42,991
- What personal life?
- Yeah.

331
00:28:44,993 --> 00:28:46,962
I worry about you, Tommy.

332
00:28:46,995 --> 00:28:49,798
Maybe if you open your mind,
you could find some peace, too.

333
00:28:51,099 --> 00:28:52,434
I sure did.

334
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:54,202
Right, yeah.

335
00:29:01,276 --> 00:29:02,844
Okay, do it for Ida then.

336
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:05,981
She wants to be a
doctor, right? Hmm?

337
00:29:06,014 --> 00:29:08,183
You could put her through
any medical school she wants.

338
00:29:17,192 --> 00:29:18,360
Where's the job?

339
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,099
Here.

340
00:29:24,132 --> 00:29:27,369
Melting Iran's shiny new
toy was just the beginning.

341
00:29:27,402 --> 00:29:29,037
<i>Langley wants a covert airstrip</i>

342
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,406
<i>just across the Afghan
border near Taybad.</i>

343
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:34,075
We're gonna go in there and
destroy their whole nuclear

344
00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:38,013
program before they have the
chance to build the big bomb.

345
00:29:38,046 --> 00:29:40,815
You'll insert here on
the Afghan side in Iran.

346
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:44,819
Jesus. Herat is crawling
with foreign spooks.

347
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:46,522
And you can't get
anybody else for this?

348
00:29:46,555 --> 00:29:48,356
I don't want anybody else.

349
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,159
Only know with you, it's not
just all about the money.

350
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:55,463
Alright.

351
00:29:56,865 --> 00:29:58,601
See this?

352
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:00,902
Taliban control all of this.

353
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:03,038
Right? North, west, east.

354
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:06,509
And your warring militias
taking shots at them all.

355
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:08,052
- What's the cover story?
- There's none.

356
00:30:08,076 --> 00:30:09,844
It's black through and through.

357
00:30:09,878 --> 00:30:11,813
- You're on your own.
- Fuck.

358
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,986
Alright, if I do this,

359
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:20,088
I'm going to need a
handler, a good one.

360
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:22,457
<i>Somebody who speaks
both Dari and Pashtun</i>

361
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,527
<i>and knows this fucking area.</i>

362
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,095
<i>He's in country right now.</i>

363
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:29,164
Tom.

364
00:30:29,197 --> 00:30:32,200
<i>- Salaam alaikum.
- Wa-alaykumus-salaam.</i>

365
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:34,936
My name is Mohammed. But
everyone calls me, Mo.

366
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:39,174
I brought you change of clothes.

367
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:42,243
Is there anyone around here
who drives a brand new SUV?

368
00:30:42,277 --> 00:30:45,046
You know we're supposed
to blend in, right?

369
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,050
We will. Americans left dozens
of these at the embassy.

370
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:51,252
Even these drug dealers
have one of these.

371
00:31:07,402 --> 00:31:08,903
Where's the safe house?

372
00:31:08,937 --> 00:31:11,306
Kandahar, which
is north of Herat.

373
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:12,641
Taliban?

374
00:31:12,675 --> 00:31:14,976
Yeah. The country
is locked up tight.

375
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:18,113
So, I mean, if you
need something,

376
00:31:18,146 --> 00:31:21,015
just let me know.
I will make a run.

377
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,552
So I take it you're
from around here?

378
00:31:23,586 --> 00:31:26,988
Yeah, born and
raised till I was 16.

379
00:31:27,021 --> 00:31:28,657
Will anyone recognize you?

380
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:32,160
No, I don't think so.

381
00:31:32,193 --> 00:31:35,397
Yeah, I haven't been here
for a very long time.

382
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,399
I mostly lived in Kabul.

383
00:31:52,748 --> 00:31:55,049
Welcome to New Afghanistan.

384
00:31:57,252 --> 00:31:58,987
Same as the old.

385
00:31:59,555 --> 00:32:00,922
Yeah.

386
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:25,146
My name is Farzad Asadi.

387
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:28,216
I'm a colonel in the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard corps.

388
00:32:28,717 --> 00:32:30,218
Jerusalem force.

389
00:32:31,352 --> 00:32:33,522
I'm not a spy.

390
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:35,658
I know you're not a spy.

391
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:37,459
Then why am I here?

392
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:44,332
Come on.

393
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:55,243
I have a daughter, too.

394
00:32:57,479 --> 00:33:00,348
Help me get you home.

395
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:01,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

396
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:04,285
Two days ago, an American
named James Vincent

397
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,322
sent you information about
my country's nuclear program.

398
00:33:07,355 --> 00:33:10,726
And now one of our nuclear
plants has been sabotaged.

399
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:13,629
Tell me about the company
you were researching.

400
00:33:13,662 --> 00:33:15,463
You had files on your computer.

401
00:33:15,497 --> 00:33:17,633
A Swiss company, Civlix.

402
00:33:17,666 --> 00:33:20,569
Okay, if you look at
Civlix locations...

403
00:33:23,304 --> 00:33:26,675
they were working
exclusively in the nuclear

404
00:33:26,709 --> 00:33:28,511
and military facilities.

405
00:33:29,845 --> 00:33:33,114
Any names at Civlix? Please.

406
00:33:33,147 --> 00:33:36,050
We didn't get any names. We
didn't... we didn't get any...

407
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:39,420
- No... no names. We don't...
- Give me some names.

408
00:33:39,454 --> 00:33:42,190
I'm telling you the truth.
We didn't get any names.

409
00:33:47,696 --> 00:33:49,532
Please believe me.

410
00:33:49,565 --> 00:33:51,332
Wait. Please believe me.

411
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:54,269
Please. You said
I could go home.

412
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:57,673
You will.

413
00:33:57,706 --> 00:33:59,274
As a martyr.

414
00:34:01,844 --> 00:34:03,812
Please!

415
00:34:03,846 --> 00:34:06,414
You said, I could
go home. Please.

416
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:50,325
There's only one bedroom.

417
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:51,358
Okay.

418
00:35:00,502 --> 00:35:03,171
Package arrived
for you yesterday.

419
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,208
What is your mission?

420
00:35:42,276 --> 00:35:44,445
Go to Landing Strip near Taybad.

421
00:35:45,346 --> 00:35:47,683
Taybad. Taybad is in Iran.

422
00:35:48,717 --> 00:35:50,451
We leave at sundown.

423
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:53,187
What do you mean we?

424
00:35:54,723 --> 00:35:56,859
What, Roman didn't tell you?

425
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:59,427
No, he just said I'm
supposed to pick you up

426
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,231
and be your translator,
but here in Herat.

427
00:36:10,706 --> 00:36:12,306
Alright, call him.

428
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,728
Salaam Alaikum.

429
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:12,484
Nahal dear, it's
good to see you.

430
00:37:12,485 --> 00:37:14,819
It's so good to see you.

431
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,448
How's your family?
How's my Adela?

432
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:19,783
They are fine.

433
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:21,661
We're living outside
of Baltimore.

434
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:26,248
Why are you here? The Taliban
are still searching for us.

435
00:37:26,249 --> 00:37:29,501
Adela's sister
Fatemah went missing.

436
00:37:29,502 --> 00:37:31,419
I promised Adela I'd find her.

437
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,130
She was teaching in Herat.

438
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:36,717
I don't know what
happened to Fatemah.

439
00:37:37,134 --> 00:37:39,387
I only know that the female
teachers disappeared.

440
00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:47,477
There was never going to be a
place for us with the Taliban.

441
00:37:47,478 --> 00:37:51,649
Not as Judges, Teachers,
Translators or Doctors.

442
00:37:53,276 --> 00:37:56,069
I'll send a word, if I hear
anything about Fatemah.

443
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:58,030
Thank you.

444
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:06,080
Come with me...
There's a flight out.

445
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:08,958
I can't leave.

446
00:38:09,834 --> 00:38:11,836
Too much was gained.

447
00:38:12,795 --> 00:38:14,422
We lost our freedom.

448
00:38:15,172 --> 00:38:16,173
We can't do it again.

449
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,551
I'm sorry.

450
00:38:47,747 --> 00:38:48,748
Hello my dear son.

451
00:39:00,593 --> 00:39:01,594
Dear son,

452
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:07,099
you are always in our hearts.

453
00:39:13,147 --> 00:39:14,607
I miss you so much.

454
00:39:28,371 --> 00:39:31,916
I wish I had died
and you were alive.

455
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:48,790
<i>C-I-A...</i>

456
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:52,761
Breaking news from
Der Herald newspaper

457
00:39:52,794 --> 00:39:55,764
exposing the CIA's
illegal black operations

458
00:39:55,797 --> 00:39:56,965
in the Middle East.

459
00:39:56,999 --> 00:39:58,533
They include the
sabotage of Iran's

460
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:01,036
top secret nuclear
reactor near Qom.

461
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:03,205
The information was
leaked by a Pentagon

462
00:40:03,238 --> 00:40:05,116
whistle-blower after passing
classified documents...

463
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,643
Come on now, hurry,
pick up the phone.

464
00:40:07,676 --> 00:40:08,610
Missing.

465
00:40:08,644 --> 00:40:10,178
Many speculate she's being held

466
00:40:10,212 --> 00:40:13,481
in an Iranian prison
awaiting public execution.

467
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,585
Der Herold's editor-in-chief,
Hans Forsberg...

468
00:40:16,586 --> 00:40:20,881
said he felt
compelled to make sure

469
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:26,720
Cujai's efforts
were not in vain.

470
00:40:26,721 --> 00:40:29,371
Hence, the releasing
of her report.

471
00:40:29,396 --> 00:40:31,505
Focuses on CIA
operatives who posed

472
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,397
as telecommunication contractors

473
00:40:33,422 --> 00:40:34,990
for a Swiss company
called, Civlix

474
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,451
causing the meltdown
of Iran's reactor.

475
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,808
The fallout from this
disclosure could be devastating

476
00:40:39,841 --> 00:40:41,076
for Western interests.

477
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:44,212
- Yo.
- Put the news on.

478
00:40:44,246 --> 00:40:45,948
Any channel.

479
00:40:45,981 --> 00:40:48,684
Just have him and tell the
guy watching the safehouse.

480
00:40:48,717 --> 00:40:50,852
There was a breach
at the Pentagon.

481
00:40:50,886 --> 00:40:51,987
We're exposed.

482
00:40:53,121 --> 00:40:54,690
How bad?

483
00:40:54,723 --> 00:40:56,825
They got your picture
and your alias

484
00:40:56,858 --> 00:40:58,492
but not your real name.

485
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,832
Can't get in touch
with Oliver, Tommy.

486
00:41:23,151 --> 00:41:24,286
What's the play?

487
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,587
Well, mission's aborted.

488
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,122
Let me get you out of there.

489
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:28,623
Hang tight.

490
00:41:40,586 --> 00:41:42,421
Get in quick.

491
00:41:45,466 --> 00:41:46,968
My scout got me this.

492
00:41:59,855 --> 00:42:02,608
We've found where
he is... Herat.

493
00:42:03,401 --> 00:42:05,360
Put together an action team.

494
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:08,364
I want to deliver him
to the Supreme Leader...

495
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:10,741
- Before sundown.
- Yes sir.

496
00:42:12,368 --> 00:42:14,829
Get me on the phone
to Agent Nazir.

497
00:42:30,803 --> 00:42:32,555
I need you in Herat.

498
00:42:33,222 --> 00:42:34,432
What's so special about Herat?

499
00:42:34,974 --> 00:42:37,727
The spy who sabotaged
the Iranians.

500
00:42:40,479 --> 00:42:42,398
Sir, I was spending my
two days of holiday.

501
00:42:43,065 --> 00:42:44,358
Leave now.

502
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:58,915
I want you to capture
him, before the Iranians.

503
00:43:02,126 --> 00:43:03,920
We'll sell him on
the open market.

504
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:10,225
Roman, I've got Chris
Hoyt here with me.

505
00:43:10,258 --> 00:43:12,360
Head of our special
operations group.

506
00:43:12,394 --> 00:43:14,963
The deputy director
asked him to sit in.

507
00:43:14,996 --> 00:43:16,765
- More the merrier.
- The field asset.

508
00:43:16,798 --> 00:43:18,800
- Tell me about him. Who is he?
- Tom Harris.

509
00:43:18,834 --> 00:43:21,703
A lifer. A loan to us from MI6.

510
00:43:21,736 --> 00:43:24,372
Total chameleon. He's one
of my go to low-vis guys.

511
00:43:24,406 --> 00:43:27,709
And he's running with a
former Afghan translator

512
00:43:27,742 --> 00:43:29,377
that we flew in to assist.

513
00:43:29,411 --> 00:43:30,745
Sounds like the
life of the party.

514
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:32,380
Are the Iranians
their only problem?

515
00:43:32,414 --> 00:43:33,815
Are you joking?

516
00:43:33,849 --> 00:43:35,250
I mean, Afghanistan right now

517
00:43:35,283 --> 00:43:36,918
is like Cold War Berlin.

518
00:43:36,952 --> 00:43:39,788
Yeah, Talibs, Paks,
Indians, Russians, Chinese,

519
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:42,357
and then you got ISISK

520
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,392
too backwards for even Al-Qaeda.

521
00:43:44,426 --> 00:43:46,294
Any of them catch my guy

522
00:43:46,328 --> 00:43:48,730
will sell him to
the highest bidder.

523
00:43:48,763 --> 00:43:51,800
Unfortunately, we're gonna
have to cut them loose.

524
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:54,903
- We have no other options.
- Yes, we do. Chris, come on.

525
00:43:54,936 --> 00:43:58,240
You know that 22 SAS is
in country right now.

526
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:00,175
Hunting Al-Qaeda's
second in command.

527
00:44:01,443 --> 00:44:03,278
He's right.

528
00:44:03,311 --> 00:44:05,413
The Brits' flight out
leaves in 30 hours.

529
00:44:09,017 --> 00:44:12,821
Okay, I'll have the
deputy director call MI6.

530
00:44:12,854 --> 00:44:14,856
I'm sure they'll be happy
to get their man back.

531
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:19,427
I'm doing the burn run now.

532
00:44:19,461 --> 00:44:21,796
I'm sorry, Tommy.

533
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,732
This is your only
shot of getting out.

534
00:44:23,765 --> 00:44:26,401
That's alright. I know
what I signed up for.

535
00:44:26,434 --> 00:44:30,038
If anyone can make it, it's you.

536
00:44:31,173 --> 00:44:32,874
Extraction point...

537
00:44:32,908 --> 00:44:36,411
is an old CIA base
in Kandahar province

538
00:44:36,444 --> 00:44:38,346
using a C-130.

539
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,182
Less than a minute
on the ground.

540
00:44:40,215 --> 00:44:42,317
How far from Kandahar are they?

541
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,919
About 400 miles.

542
00:44:43,952 --> 00:44:47,189
But the distance is
not the main issue.

543
00:44:47,222 --> 00:44:48,823
It's what's in between.

544
00:44:52,194 --> 00:44:54,196
Let's grab him quick
and get him back home.

545
00:44:54,822 --> 00:44:56,907
The Taliban are
looking for any excuse

546
00:44:56,908 --> 00:44:59,327
to blame us for their failures.

547
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:02,746
Avoid civilian
casualties at all costs.

548
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:03,831
Understand?

549
00:45:08,176 --> 00:45:09,176
Alright.

550
00:45:12,881 --> 00:45:14,316
What are you doing?

551
00:45:15,417 --> 00:45:17,118
Cover's blown.

552
00:45:17,152 --> 00:45:19,254
- Get your stuff.
- How?

553
00:45:19,287 --> 00:45:20,956
Doesn't matter how.

554
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:23,291
We'll leave for
Kandahar in 15 minutes.

555
00:45:23,325 --> 00:45:26,328
Kandahar? We were supposed
to leave from here tomorrow.

556
00:45:28,196 --> 00:45:29,731
Not anymore.

557
00:45:35,136 --> 00:45:36,271
Come on. Let's go.

558
00:46:01,347 --> 00:46:02,682
The honorable Kahil.

559
00:46:03,231 --> 00:46:04,966
Slumming it with us again.

560
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,204
Rasoul, I need a crew for
snatch and drive in Gandhar.

561
00:46:09,237 --> 00:46:10,972
Use your red units.

562
00:46:11,006 --> 00:46:13,008
Not those guys who are
always high on bugs spray.

563
00:46:13,401 --> 00:46:14,986
I know who you want...

564
00:46:16,362 --> 00:46:19,699
But the Iranians have already
paid, to cross the border.

565
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,368
He's their target now.

566
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:26,247
I'll double whatever
they pay you.

567
00:46:27,456 --> 00:46:28,958
I don't want money.

568
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,043
Make me the head of
the military council,

569
00:46:32,044 --> 00:46:33,754
my Pakistani brother.

570
00:46:33,862 --> 00:46:35,230
Okay, okay, okay. Yeah.

571
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,132
Just make sure your
fucking crew is ready.

572
00:47:18,106 --> 00:47:19,608
They're out of the safe house.

573
00:47:19,642 --> 00:47:21,109
Keep your eyes
peeled for hostiles.

574
00:47:21,142 --> 00:47:22,444
- Roger that.
- Start the clock.

575
00:47:22,477 --> 00:47:24,012
We engage if they make contact?

576
00:47:24,045 --> 00:47:26,281
No way. We're not
working under title 50.

577
00:47:26,314 --> 00:47:27,650
No, we can only advise.

578
00:47:27,683 --> 00:47:30,085
They wonder why we can't win.

579
00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:39,028
We're green. Go.

580
00:47:51,106 --> 00:47:52,641
Keep your eye out for a hoopty.

581
00:47:52,675 --> 00:47:54,677
- For what?
- It's a shitty car.

582
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,212
We got to ditch this one.

583
00:47:57,245 --> 00:47:59,247
You know, maybe we
should have split up.

584
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,249
I mean, I can hide
here for a few days

585
00:48:01,282 --> 00:48:03,318
and then take a flight
from Herat to Pakistan.

586
00:48:03,351 --> 00:48:05,220
Yeah, good idea, Mo.

587
00:48:05,253 --> 00:48:08,423
And get some rest before they
snatch you at Herat airport.

588
00:48:08,456 --> 00:48:10,125
That way, you'll last longer

589
00:48:10,158 --> 00:48:12,160
when they start pulling
your fingernails off.

590
00:48:16,297 --> 00:48:18,400
There's the market there.

591
00:48:18,433 --> 00:48:20,201
Okay, let's go this way.

592
00:48:24,282 --> 00:48:25,283
They're in the market.

593
00:48:44,627 --> 00:48:46,094
Where is he going?

594
00:48:46,127 --> 00:48:48,129
I see two SUV's
approaching the market.

595
00:48:53,401 --> 00:48:54,401
Here.

596
00:48:57,773 --> 00:49:00,041
Take the bags off the back.

597
00:49:00,074 --> 00:49:02,177
Wait for my signal, okay?

598
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,210
Okay.

599
00:49:51,527 --> 00:49:52,528
Oy, oy, oy!

600
00:50:02,672 --> 00:50:04,840
They changed vehicles!
Nissan truck.

601
00:50:07,468 --> 00:50:08,469
Don't lose him.

602
00:50:08,977 --> 00:50:10,789
They're switching into
a white Nissan pickup.

603
00:50:10,813 --> 00:50:12,180
White Nissan.

604
00:50:12,213 --> 00:50:13,516
Someone try to get the plates.

605
00:50:15,893 --> 00:50:17,228
Still can't find them.

606
00:50:19,772 --> 00:50:20,898
Search the entire city.

607
00:50:40,576 --> 00:50:41,577
Shit.

608
00:50:42,678 --> 00:50:44,178
Coming to traffic.

609
00:50:44,212 --> 00:50:45,490
There are two vehicles emerging.

610
00:50:45,514 --> 00:50:46,615
Ah.

611
00:50:48,249 --> 00:50:50,553
What's the way through this?

612
00:50:50,586 --> 00:50:53,087
The only way to Kandahar
is the highway one.

613
00:50:53,121 --> 00:50:54,657
It's on the other
side of the town.

614
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,567
Stay here, in case
he tries to escape.

615
00:51:19,248 --> 00:51:21,751
We've got company,
black motorcycle.

616
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:29,342
We see him.

617
00:51:34,228 --> 00:51:35,788
Tell him to get away
from the truck, Mo.

618
00:51:43,505 --> 00:51:45,908
Fuck!

619
00:51:45,941 --> 00:51:48,343
Fuck! Fuckin' clutch.

620
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:55,321
Oh my God, you idiot!

621
00:51:55,784 --> 00:51:57,352
Sorry.

622
00:51:57,385 --> 00:51:59,671
I am sorry. What the hell?
Look what you did to my car.

623
00:51:59,696 --> 00:52:02,032
May your house fall down.

624
00:52:07,495 --> 00:52:09,029
Sorry, here, one minute.

625
00:52:10,948 --> 00:52:12,158
Police!

626
00:52:16,002 --> 00:52:18,532
Yeah, here, here, here,
sorry, I'm sorry, okay.

627
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,622
Hurry! Block him!
Block his way, hurry!

628
00:52:55,678 --> 00:52:58,090
Tom! Tom, go!

629
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:13,112
Get out!

630
00:53:40,556 --> 00:53:42,767
They're in a Nissan
pickup. Find them!

631
00:53:43,935 --> 00:53:45,561
We have our scouts
searching now.

632
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:56,572
Highway one is straight ahead.

633
00:54:02,611 --> 00:54:03,611
What are you doing?

634
00:54:06,548 --> 00:54:08,984
I'm telling you we are
going the wrong way.

635
00:54:09,017 --> 00:54:10,686
No, it's a detour.

636
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:20,562
Get down!

637
00:54:36,879 --> 00:54:38,747
God, I like this
guy. He is good.

638
00:54:51,043 --> 00:54:53,462
They got away... heading
east from the warehouse area.

639
00:55:21,857 --> 00:55:23,959
Oh, shit.

640
00:55:23,992 --> 00:55:25,694
Check for a spare
tire in the back.

641
00:55:30,732 --> 00:55:32,333
Oh, my God. Yes.

642
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:36,437
Okay, I'll pull security.
You change the tire.

643
00:55:42,476 --> 00:55:44,680
Mo, Hurry up. We're
exposed out here.

644
00:55:44,713 --> 00:55:45,713
Yeah.

645
00:55:46,148 --> 00:55:47,816
Come on.

646
00:55:48,884 --> 00:55:50,451
What piece of shit!

647
00:55:50,484 --> 00:55:52,588
You do it yourself!

648
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:00,596
It's the adrenaline.
You're coming down.

649
00:56:00,629 --> 00:56:02,807
- Try to drink some water.
- Who was the guy on the bike?

650
00:56:02,831 --> 00:56:06,400
I need you to focus, okay?
Just change the fucking tire!

651
00:56:07,035 --> 00:56:08,503
Well...

652
00:56:08,537 --> 00:56:10,873
Well, well, I know...

653
00:56:10,906 --> 00:56:12,941
I know when I'm being lied to.

654
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:15,611
Mo, where are you going?

655
00:56:15,644 --> 00:56:19,147
I came here to find
my wife's sister.

656
00:56:19,181 --> 00:56:21,783
And that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

657
00:56:21,817 --> 00:56:24,519
- Your wife's sister?
- Yes. She was missing.

658
00:56:24,553 --> 00:56:26,989
I'm not leaving Herat
until I find her.

659
00:56:27,022 --> 00:56:30,092
Well, you're not gonna find
her if you're fucking dead.

660
00:56:30,125 --> 00:56:31,793
Good luck to you.

661
00:56:48,911 --> 00:56:50,178
- Mo?
- Huh?

662
00:56:50,212 --> 00:56:51,980
Call him to come out.

663
00:57:04,993 --> 00:57:07,461
Tom, Tom, he's
just a little boy.

664
00:57:14,102 --> 00:57:16,104
Tell him to drop it.

665
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:28,550
Jesus.

666
00:57:38,994 --> 00:57:41,596
You won't make it
on your own, Mo.

667
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,532
Then tell me what's
truly going on.

668
00:57:47,602 --> 00:57:49,538
This is my life in your hands.

669
00:57:51,673 --> 00:57:54,810
I burned their
house down in Iran.

670
00:57:54,843 --> 00:57:56,477
The nuclear reactor?

671
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:03,185
Why can't CIA agents
just come and pick us up?

672
00:58:03,218 --> 00:58:05,887
We're cutouts in an
even bigger game.

673
00:58:05,921 --> 00:58:09,024
But what it means is no
one is coming to rescue us.

674
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:11,593
Okay?

675
00:58:13,028 --> 00:58:16,198
So we just got to
get to Kandahar,

676
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:17,799
and then we'll regroup,

677
00:58:22,704 --> 00:58:24,573
Okay?

678
00:58:24,606 --> 00:58:26,608
And then I'll help you
find your wife's sister.

679
00:58:28,276 --> 00:58:31,146
I'm sorry, Mo.

680
00:58:31,179 --> 00:58:33,015
I should have told
you the truth earlier.

681
00:59:18,811 --> 00:59:20,646
He went that way!

682
00:59:27,836 --> 00:59:30,672
Do you really think we
can make it to Kandahar?

683
00:59:30,705 --> 00:59:33,675
Not without help.

684
00:59:33,708 --> 00:59:36,078
There's someone I've worked
with before south of here.

685
00:59:37,312 --> 00:59:39,081
And maybe he has a helicopter.

686
00:59:41,049 --> 00:59:42,651
Let's go.

687
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,378
<i>Asalamualaikum.</i>

688
01:00:10,412 --> 01:00:13,181
Ismail, it's Roman.

689
01:00:13,215 --> 01:00:14,382
Look, I need a favor.

690
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:19,371
Iranian pigs go home!

691
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:21,749
Traitors!

692
01:00:22,708 --> 01:00:27,672
The Taliban are letting us
take the body back to Tehran.

693
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:33,511
Hi, my love.

694
01:00:34,053 --> 01:00:35,220
When will you be coming home?

695
01:00:35,221 --> 01:00:36,430
I want to make us dinner.

696
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,141
I'm going to be late.

697
01:00:41,644 --> 01:00:42,645
Is everything alright?

698
01:00:46,607 --> 01:00:48,109
I'll be back as soon as I can.

699
01:00:49,151 --> 01:00:50,528
Give Camila a kiss from Baba.

700
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:53,990
Okay.

701
01:00:55,032 --> 01:00:56,284
Stay safe, Farzad.

702
01:01:18,931 --> 01:01:19,932
Do you know who I am?

703
01:01:24,145 --> 01:01:25,265
What are you doing out here?

704
01:01:25,855 --> 01:01:28,148
Protecting the
road from Takfiris,

705
01:01:28,149 --> 01:01:30,651
non-believers and
enemies of the Taliban.

706
01:01:31,235 --> 01:01:32,319
I can build IEDs,

707
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,823
fire rifles, AKs,
M4s and Sig Sauers.

708
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:45,019
Have you read the
Quran for yourself?

709
01:01:48,377 --> 01:01:49,378
No, right?

710
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:52,130
Then how can you
know what it means

711
01:01:52,131 --> 01:01:54,133
to be a true believer?

712
01:01:56,219 --> 01:01:58,012
You might find it to
be very different...

713
01:01:59,138 --> 01:02:01,140
from what they're
telling you it says.

714
01:02:08,981 --> 01:02:10,691
Hey little one...

715
01:02:11,275 --> 01:02:12,485
have you seen this man?

716
01:02:13,254 --> 01:02:14,554
Mm-hmm.

717
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:16,132
Do you know where he was going?

718
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,502
Toward Delaram.

719
01:02:20,408 --> 01:02:21,810
Huh.

720
01:02:23,641 --> 01:02:24,642
Thank you.

721
01:04:02,645 --> 01:04:06,014
Ah...

722
01:04:06,047 --> 01:04:08,083
How much longer to your friend?

723
01:04:08,116 --> 01:04:10,852
About another 20 miles or so.

724
01:04:16,391 --> 01:04:18,059
Do you hear this?

725
01:04:20,362 --> 01:04:22,163
- Yeah.
- I... I...

726
01:04:22,197 --> 01:04:25,367
I think there is something
wrong with the tire again.

727
01:04:28,937 --> 01:04:30,338
That's not our car.

728
01:04:50,059 --> 01:04:51,060
Take the shot!

729
01:04:57,399 --> 01:04:58,399
Take the wheel, Mo!

730
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:06,408
- I can't see where I'm going!
- Just keep it straight!

731
01:05:06,534 --> 01:05:08,494
We're taking fire.

732
01:05:50,244 --> 01:05:51,495
Fire another shot!

733
01:06:00,395 --> 01:06:01,463
Ah!

734
01:06:01,547 --> 01:06:02,548
He's hit!

735
01:06:06,735 --> 01:06:08,537
The engine's down!

736
01:06:08,571 --> 01:06:10,338
Get ready to bail.

737
01:06:12,808 --> 01:06:14,342
Let's go! Move, move!

738
01:06:26,154 --> 01:06:27,222
Run, Mo!

739
01:06:29,123 --> 01:06:31,259
- Where?
- Just run!

740
01:07:05,611 --> 01:07:07,029
Land!

741
01:07:59,165 --> 01:08:01,291
Split up... Flank
their position.

742
01:08:01,292 --> 01:08:02,375
Copy.

743
01:08:02,376 --> 01:08:03,461
Copy.

744
01:09:22,296 --> 01:09:24,298
You'll always be...

745
01:09:35,944 --> 01:09:39,548
That's our comeback ride.
Stay down, don't move.

746
01:09:39,581 --> 01:09:40,616
Alright.

747
01:10:15,426 --> 01:10:16,427
There!

748
01:10:18,554 --> 01:10:19,597
Kill him.

749
01:10:47,516 --> 01:10:51,720
Oh, God, forgive our
living and our dead.

750
01:10:51,754 --> 01:10:53,822
Yeah, used me as bait.

751
01:10:55,023 --> 01:10:56,625
But it worked.

752
01:11:05,601 --> 01:11:08,036
- Looks like we're on foot.
- Huh.

753
01:11:10,572 --> 01:11:12,508
We're-we're refueling the UAV.

754
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:15,644
- Where are they now?
- We've lost 'em.

755
01:11:15,677 --> 01:11:19,648
- Has Roman checked in?
- No. Why?

756
01:11:21,817 --> 01:11:23,384
- Copy.
- Should I be worried?

757
01:11:25,221 --> 01:11:27,277
If those were my guys, I'd
be blowing up your phone

758
01:11:27,302 --> 01:11:28,421
every ten minutes.

759
01:11:41,103 --> 01:11:43,806
Are you sure you don't
want me to wait up for ya?

760
01:11:43,839 --> 01:11:45,707
What are you gonna do
if we can't find you?

761
01:11:45,741 --> 01:11:48,811
I'm practically the only white
dude left in this country.

762
01:11:48,844 --> 01:11:52,380
Can't be too hard to find.
Get home safe, brother.

763
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:32,897
Are you ready...
to fight for Allah?

764
01:12:37,659 --> 01:12:38,659
Ah.

765
01:12:40,829 --> 01:12:44,833
May the dust rise and
the apostles hear a cry.

766
01:12:48,136 --> 01:12:49,771
Let's do it.

767
01:13:13,795 --> 01:13:15,197
I have to pray.

768
01:13:21,937 --> 01:13:22,938
Ah.

769
01:13:24,506 --> 01:13:29,645
Ah. My knees are killing me.

770
01:13:29,678 --> 01:13:32,180
Here. Ah.

771
01:13:32,214 --> 01:13:33,815
Take this.

772
01:13:47,229 --> 01:13:48,830
Thank you.

773
01:14:34,743 --> 01:14:35,811
Thank you.

774
01:14:46,154 --> 01:14:49,992
Not exactly best
way to break a fast,

775
01:14:50,025 --> 01:14:53,195
but it's all I've got.

776
01:15:06,675 --> 01:15:07,809
Mm...

777
01:15:16,051 --> 01:15:17,686
Battle buddy?

778
01:15:23,091 --> 01:15:24,793
His name is Siddiqui.

779
01:15:26,795 --> 01:15:30,766
He was my translator
through six tours.

780
01:15:32,934 --> 01:15:35,904
For six fucking tours.

781
01:15:35,937 --> 01:15:40,275
Tried to get him to
the, the US or London.

782
01:15:40,308 --> 01:15:42,778
Anywhere safe.

783
01:15:42,811 --> 01:15:45,347
Then ISIS rode through Mosul...

784
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:47,682
and they hung him.

785
01:15:48,917 --> 01:15:50,152
My pleader.

786
01:15:54,656 --> 01:15:56,958
Yeah, we rely on you
guys for everything.

787
01:15:59,628 --> 01:16:02,831
I mean, the language,
the culture.

788
01:16:05,233 --> 01:16:08,837
You risk your lives for us...

789
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:13,075
and then we tell you exactly

790
01:16:13,108 --> 01:16:16,178
what your country should look
like and how you should act.

791
01:16:19,281 --> 01:16:22,584
Half the time we don't
even say thank you.

792
01:16:24,686 --> 01:16:27,756
Oh, no, I'm glad you made
it to the States, Mo.

793
01:16:29,091 --> 01:16:30,725
Got your family out.

794
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,962
Not all of them made it.

795
01:16:36,731 --> 01:16:40,135
My oldest son, Hamid,
was killed here.

796
01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:48,743
Are you married?

797
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,415
I was.

798
01:16:53,448 --> 01:16:56,918
- Do you have kids?
- I do.

799
01:16:56,952 --> 01:16:59,721
I have a, a photo.

800
01:17:08,330 --> 01:17:12,000
Ida. She's, uh, she's, uh, 17.

801
01:17:12,033 --> 01:17:13,702
She's beautiful.

802
01:17:14,903 --> 01:17:16,738
Ah. Thanks.

803
01:17:20,475 --> 01:17:23,979
I was supposed to be at her
graduation this weekend.

804
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,915
You have to go home, Tom.

805
01:17:29,184 --> 01:17:32,420
You have to go home and
hold her in your arms

806
01:17:32,454 --> 01:17:35,857
before you even forget
what it feels like.

807
01:17:36,825 --> 01:17:40,729
See, my, my Hamid is gone,

808
01:17:40,762 --> 01:17:44,132
and all I have left
is just the picture.

809
01:17:49,271 --> 01:17:50,839
You know, it's funny.

810
01:17:53,141 --> 01:17:56,044
Here I am, talking to
a guy I barely know.

811
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:03,018
Somehow, I, I'm more comfortable
with you than I am with family.

812
01:18:11,493 --> 01:18:13,128
Excuse me.

813
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:47,422
That's them. Raise your hands.

814
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:49,824
Let 'em know we're not a threat.

815
01:19:49,858 --> 01:19:52,060
That's a flag of Tajik warlord.

816
01:19:54,362 --> 01:19:55,897
I know.

817
01:19:59,868 --> 01:20:02,937
Say we're friends
of Ismail Rabbani.

818
01:20:02,971 --> 01:20:04,973
We're asking Rabbani for help?

819
01:20:05,006 --> 01:20:07,309
Do it before they get
trigger-happy, Mo.

820
01:20:13,114 --> 01:20:14,182
<i>Salam Alaikum.</i>

821
01:21:28,423 --> 01:21:31,025
- Ismail Rabbani.
- Heh-heh.

822
01:21:31,059 --> 01:21:34,597
My friend, your face
is all over the news.

823
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:36,998
- Ah.
- Good to see you.

824
01:21:39,334 --> 01:21:42,904
Been too long. This
is, uh, Mohammed.

825
01:21:48,042 --> 01:21:49,978
<i>Asalamualaikum.</i>

826
01:21:54,382 --> 01:21:56,050
<i>Wa-alaikum-salam.</i>

827
01:22:00,255 --> 01:22:03,726
So what brings you to Farah?

828
01:22:03,759 --> 01:22:05,493
We have to get to Kandahar.

829
01:22:05,528 --> 01:22:08,062
Oh, if you'd only
come by yesterday,

830
01:22:08,096 --> 01:22:10,666
I would have flown you myself.

831
01:22:10,699 --> 01:22:12,200
Well, the Taliban
borrow my helicopter

832
01:22:12,233 --> 01:22:14,202
for operation in the north. Hm.

833
01:22:16,237 --> 01:22:18,707
I can give you a truck.
I have plenty of those.

834
01:22:18,741 --> 01:22:21,009
You will be there
in three hours.

835
01:22:21,042 --> 01:22:22,745
- My brother.
- We are about to eat.

836
01:22:22,778 --> 01:22:24,513
Are you hungry?

837
01:22:30,586 --> 01:22:32,153
Our morning's work.

838
01:22:38,026 --> 01:22:40,495
Sure had some good
times together, huh,

839
01:22:40,529 --> 01:22:43,298
facing them Osama's boys.

840
01:22:43,331 --> 01:22:46,334
Yeah, we gave them a run for
their money. That's for sure.

841
01:22:46,367 --> 01:22:49,270
Feels like a lifetime
ago, but don't worry,

842
01:22:49,304 --> 01:22:52,207
soon we will be all
back at it again.

843
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:54,142
The harder you try to
stamp out an ideology,

844
01:22:54,175 --> 01:22:56,077
the stronger it becomes.

845
01:23:01,567 --> 01:23:03,027
No, thank you.

846
01:23:03,318 --> 01:23:05,588
Hm?

847
01:23:05,621 --> 01:23:08,557
Hm. What is with
the good Muslim boy?

848
01:23:13,495 --> 01:23:15,096
Ah.

849
01:23:15,164 --> 01:23:16,666
It must feel...

850
01:23:17,124 --> 01:23:18,584
strange for you...

851
01:23:18,876 --> 01:23:20,210
Like a lion tamer...

852
01:23:20,211 --> 01:23:22,296
entering the cage,
without his whip,

853
01:23:23,297 --> 01:23:25,424
Neither American, nor Afghan.

854
01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:27,051
You have no place.

855
01:23:30,513 --> 01:23:32,682
I know who you really are.

856
01:23:33,432 --> 01:23:34,433
Me?

857
01:23:35,977 --> 01:23:37,311
Enlighten me.

858
01:23:37,895 --> 01:23:39,272
You are a traitor.

859
01:23:43,559 --> 01:23:47,295
Mo... what are you doing?

860
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:51,399
Your friend is a
warlord who razed Herat.

861
01:23:51,432 --> 01:23:53,167
It was only business.

862
01:23:54,603 --> 01:23:56,539
A higher bidder paid me for it.

863
01:23:56,572 --> 01:23:58,172
And I will do it
again just like I did

864
01:23:58,206 --> 01:24:01,142
for the Russians,
I did it for ISI.

865
01:24:01,175 --> 01:24:04,547
I did it for Americans and
I will do it for Taliban.

866
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:09,117
You killed thousands.
Women and children.

867
01:24:09,150 --> 01:24:11,554
One of them was my son.

868
01:24:20,271 --> 01:24:21,439
Your son?

869
01:24:26,152 --> 01:24:28,863
I am... truly sorry.

870
01:24:30,471 --> 01:24:32,675
Ismail, well...
You want revenge?

871
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:35,578
Is that what you want? Huh?

872
01:24:37,145 --> 01:24:39,447
Is that it, revenge?
An eye for an eye?

873
01:24:41,617 --> 01:24:42,651
Hm.

874
01:24:47,723 --> 01:24:50,358
Here, take it. It is only fair.

875
01:24:50,391 --> 01:24:53,062
A violent act must
be met with another.

876
01:24:56,632 --> 01:24:59,501
Go ahead. Take it.

877
01:25:10,646 --> 01:25:12,648
Ismail, come on.

878
01:25:12,681 --> 01:25:14,516
Stay out of it, Tom.

879
01:25:16,417 --> 01:25:18,621
Hm.

880
01:25:18,654 --> 01:25:21,790
Ever hear the story
of the Afghan man

881
01:25:21,824 --> 01:25:24,258
who lived for 700 years?

882
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:30,633
On his 700th birthday, the
great Amir, Dost Mohammad Khan,

883
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:32,367
threw him a, a lavish party.

884
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,236
And after all the
guests had left,

885
01:25:35,269 --> 01:25:39,642
the Amir said in confidence,
"I am surrounded by enemies."

886
01:25:41,677 --> 01:25:45,914
"What is your secret to be
living in such dangerous place

887
01:25:45,948 --> 01:25:48,751
for a long time?"

888
01:25:48,784 --> 01:25:51,252
And the man looked
at him and said...

889
01:25:52,721 --> 01:25:56,592
"It is easy. Change sides."

890
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:00,294
I know the story.

891
01:26:04,566 --> 01:26:06,669
And this way,

892
01:26:06,702 --> 01:26:10,438
our country can never be as one.

893
01:26:15,177 --> 01:26:17,638
God might not
forgive your sins...

894
01:26:24,478 --> 01:26:26,522
but I do.

895
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,738
But I do.

896
01:26:34,697 --> 01:26:36,197
Mo.

897
01:26:37,733 --> 01:26:38,767
Ismail.

898
01:26:48,476 --> 01:26:49,611
Oh.

899
01:26:55,483 --> 01:26:59,755
I... I'm so sorry, Mo.
I... I had no idea.

900
01:26:59,788 --> 01:27:03,391
You called him your brother.
Do you know how insulting this?

901
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:06,028
He killed my son
and thousands more

902
01:27:06,061 --> 01:27:09,031
because of you and people
like you empowering him

903
01:27:09,064 --> 01:27:11,365
without caring about my people!

904
01:27:13,635 --> 01:27:14,703
Shame on you.

905
01:27:15,637 --> 01:27:16,805
Shame on you.

906
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:19,367
For you.

907
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:25,346
Look, we can refuse his help

908
01:27:25,379 --> 01:27:28,617
and we just walk out of here.
You wanna do that, I'm in.

909
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:31,553
Oh.

910
01:27:31,587 --> 01:27:33,989
I just want to go.

911
01:27:34,022 --> 01:27:37,793
I want to go to my
family. That's it.

912
01:27:39,094 --> 01:27:40,796
I just want to go home.

913
01:27:45,366 --> 01:27:47,703
Mo, this is our best chance.

914
01:28:20,434 --> 01:28:22,671
<i>Asalamualaikum.</i>

915
01:28:54,736 --> 01:28:55,737
<i>Behenchod.</i>

916
01:28:59,488 --> 01:29:00,610
Hello?

917
01:29:00,634 --> 01:29:02,800
Our target is
heading to Kandahar.

918
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:06,500
His flight is
leaving in six hours.

919
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:11,767
He is travelling in
an old ANA truck.

920
01:29:13,027 --> 01:29:14,986
I will catch this spy for you.

921
01:29:15,037 --> 01:29:16,122
Good.

922
01:29:17,371 --> 01:29:19,295
But after that I
want a transfer.

923
01:29:19,975 --> 01:29:22,310
I am sick of the desert...

924
01:29:22,335 --> 01:29:24,983
This place is like
a rotting corpse.

925
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,494
Then where would you
like to go, Kahil?

926
01:29:28,837 --> 01:29:30,438
London.

927
01:29:32,007 --> 01:29:33,549
Paris.

928
01:29:34,239 --> 01:29:35,239
I don't know.

929
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:36,437
Okay I promise...

930
01:29:36,462 --> 01:29:38,630
that you will get all the

931
01:29:38,631 --> 01:29:41,217
western "culture" you want.

932
01:29:41,393 --> 01:29:43,114
Only if you get this
job done for me.

933
01:29:52,478 --> 01:29:54,647
Rasoul, it is me.

934
01:30:11,813 --> 01:30:14,549
Did you think that
this will ever end?

935
01:30:19,021 --> 01:30:21,690
Ancient wars were
fought for spoils.

936
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:25,661
Modern wars aren't
meant to be won.

937
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:33,936
Tom!

938
01:31:05,867 --> 01:31:07,602
Fucking Ismail.

939
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:13,942
You should have shot him.

940
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:48,302
The Paks can have your friend.

941
01:31:49,595 --> 01:31:50,972
Or the Iranians.

942
01:31:52,473 --> 01:31:53,891
I don't care about him.

943
01:31:56,811 --> 01:31:59,313
But you will never leave here.

944
01:32:00,648 --> 01:32:01,649
Traitor.

945
01:32:03,609 --> 01:32:06,612
You must pay for your sins.

946
01:32:07,613 --> 01:32:08,614
Rasoul.

947
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:11,200
ISIS is attacking us!

948
01:32:23,546 --> 01:32:24,964
Go! Go!

949
01:33:06,005 --> 01:33:07,590
Go there, go!

950
01:33:24,982 --> 01:33:26,776
ISIS fighters are attacking us!

951
01:33:27,985 --> 01:33:29,362
ISIS, are you sure?

952
01:33:29,612 --> 01:33:31,155
They have heavy weapons!

953
01:33:32,013 --> 01:33:34,021
I need air support now.

954
01:33:34,046 --> 01:33:36,852
Nah, nah, nah, nah. Rasoul,
don't be a bitch. You hear me!

955
01:33:36,885 --> 01:33:38,165
Hold them off until I get there.

956
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:40,155
Rasoul. I'm coming
for the target.

957
01:33:45,909 --> 01:33:47,735
Pakistani asshole!

958
01:34:04,251 --> 01:34:05,286
Ah!

959
01:34:27,089 --> 01:34:28,280
Hit the gate!

960
01:34:29,150 --> 01:34:30,393
Hit the gate!

961
01:34:58,501 --> 01:35:00,135
<i>Allahu-Akbar!</i>

962
01:35:21,098 --> 01:35:22,474
They broke through the gate.

963
01:35:22,475 --> 01:35:23,559
Everyone to the gate.

964
01:35:39,474 --> 01:35:40,976
Hello, Thomas.

965
01:35:41,009 --> 01:35:42,511
Oh, fuck you.

966
01:35:42,545 --> 01:35:44,913
- It's not funny. Ah.
- You okay?

967
01:35:44,946 --> 01:35:47,115
What happened? How
did you get here, man?

968
01:35:47,148 --> 01:35:48,517
Rode in with my Afghan.

969
01:35:48,551 --> 01:35:51,987
Special Forces buddies,
pretending to be ISIS.

970
01:35:52,020 --> 01:35:54,889
- Uh, pretty good, huh?
- Oh, fuck.

971
01:35:54,923 --> 01:35:56,791
Hey, wait, wait,
wait. What about Mo?

972
01:35:56,825 --> 01:35:58,860
He's in here somewhere.

973
01:35:58,893 --> 01:36:00,295
Let's go find him.

974
01:36:10,372 --> 01:36:11,806
Mo?

975
01:36:12,508 --> 01:36:13,908
Mo?

976
01:36:19,314 --> 01:36:21,783
Mo? Mo?

977
01:36:22,284 --> 01:36:23,351
Uh...

978
01:36:25,086 --> 01:36:27,355
Oh. Motherfucker!

979
01:36:27,389 --> 01:36:29,157
Roman, in here.

980
01:36:29,190 --> 01:36:32,561
You okay? I got you,
Mo. I got you. Jesus.

981
01:36:32,595 --> 01:36:34,496
I'm sorry, Mo.

982
01:36:34,530 --> 01:36:38,867
Come on. You get up.

983
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:41,369
Out of here. Out of here.

984
01:36:48,561 --> 01:36:49,562
That's not ISIS.

985
01:36:50,021 --> 01:36:51,021
What?

986
01:36:51,022 --> 01:36:53,107
They're Afghan Commandos.

987
01:36:56,484 --> 01:36:58,186
Almost there. Hang on...

988
01:37:01,156 --> 01:37:03,592
Ah.

989
01:37:03,626 --> 01:37:05,386
What about your SF guys?
Can we get them out?

990
01:37:08,597 --> 01:37:10,899
They are never
gonna stop fighting.

991
01:37:23,387 --> 01:37:25,598
We'll cut them off at Maiwand.

992
01:37:26,766 --> 01:37:28,475
An old CIA base is near there.

993
01:37:28,476 --> 01:37:30,685
The Brits have an inbound plane.

994
01:37:30,686 --> 01:37:31,937
This is Agent Nazir.

995
01:37:31,938 --> 01:37:34,773
All Taliban Red Unit
and Badri 313...

996
01:37:34,774 --> 01:37:39,028
Prepare to stage in Maiwand.

997
01:37:40,663 --> 01:37:43,064
Sir, there they are.

998
01:37:43,098 --> 01:37:44,633
Moving in with Reaper.

999
01:37:44,667 --> 01:37:47,001
Confirming signal from
town's blue force.

1000
01:38:10,492 --> 01:38:12,160
This guy doesn't quit.

1001
01:38:13,428 --> 01:38:14,996
No, he doesn't.

1002
01:38:19,777 --> 01:38:21,028
Stay close.

1003
01:38:24,439 --> 01:38:26,040
Stay on the fence line.

1004
01:38:26,074 --> 01:38:27,676
There's a perimeter
gate four klicks up.

1005
01:38:47,128 --> 01:38:49,164
He's right on our ass.

1006
01:39:00,341 --> 01:39:01,544
Ah!

1007
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:26,367
Ah!

1008
01:39:30,806 --> 01:39:33,041
Everybody okay? Mo, good?

1009
01:39:33,074 --> 01:39:35,443
Ah, it's Roman. Oh, my God!

1010
01:39:35,477 --> 01:39:37,045
- Shit.
- Ah.

1011
01:39:37,078 --> 01:39:39,414
- Roman.
- He's bleeding very badly.

1012
01:39:39,447 --> 01:39:41,483
Mo, find something to
pack him with. Quick.

1013
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:43,586
It's alright. It's alright.

1014
01:39:47,255 --> 01:39:50,124
Roman, just hang on, okay?

1015
01:39:50,158 --> 01:39:51,627
We're gonna make
it to the flight.

1016
01:39:53,796 --> 01:39:55,531
- Roman!
- No, Roman!

1017
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:01,804
Tom, we have to go back.

1018
01:40:29,615 --> 01:40:31,909
Get the bike ready.

1019
01:40:54,932 --> 01:40:58,352
There is no god... except Allah.

1020
01:41:02,481 --> 01:41:03,524
And...

1021
01:41:05,484 --> 01:41:07,653
Muhammad is...

1022
01:41:11,407 --> 01:41:13,075
The messenger of Allah.

1023
01:41:15,494 --> 01:41:16,913
The Gentle...

1024
01:41:20,791 --> 01:41:22,334
The Merciful...

1025
01:41:22,335 --> 01:41:23,753
The Kind...

1026
01:41:35,014 --> 01:41:37,015
This is Agent Nazir.

1027
01:41:37,016 --> 01:41:38,476
Mortar team on my signal.

1028
01:41:54,158 --> 01:41:55,826
Fire at the Land Cruiser!

1029
01:41:56,285 --> 01:41:57,495
Now! Now!

1030
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:05,894
Alright, Mo. Get ready.

1031
01:42:07,462 --> 01:42:08,496
Ah.

1032
01:42:13,401 --> 01:42:17,338
Hang on, Mo. Almost there!

1033
01:42:17,372 --> 01:42:20,542
- We are not gonna make it, Tom.
- We're gonna make it.

1034
01:42:24,312 --> 01:42:25,948
Copy, Bravo Six.
Prepare for landing.

1035
01:42:39,828 --> 01:42:43,431
Multiple bogies emerging
from the north and east.

1036
01:42:43,464 --> 01:42:44,967
RPG's spotted on
the left window.

1037
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,434
ETA on the Brit
slide is one minute.

1038
01:42:46,467 --> 01:42:48,269
Christ, they're
gonna block the gate.

1039
01:42:48,302 --> 01:42:49,672
Tell the birds to
hold the plane.

1040
01:42:49,705 --> 01:42:50,705
Copy.

1041
01:42:56,979 --> 01:42:59,447
Roger, Bravo Six. Move
your best to hold.

1042
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:01,817
However, we have
targeted civilian...

1043
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:03,284
Come, let's go, boys.

1044
01:43:10,626 --> 01:43:12,260
I see the gate.

1045
01:43:14,539 --> 01:43:16,627
Don't let them enter the base.

1046
01:43:46,061 --> 01:43:48,480
- Hm?
- Tom?

1047
01:43:48,505 --> 01:43:49,814
Stop all fire.

1048
01:43:49,815 --> 01:43:52,019
All Taliban forces
hold your position.

1049
01:43:59,126 --> 01:44:00,325
The target is mine.

1050
01:44:00,326 --> 01:44:01,619
I'm going in.

1051
01:44:24,465 --> 01:44:25,866
Stay here.

1052
01:44:34,636 --> 01:44:37,339
He is going to kill you.

1053
01:44:39,216 --> 01:44:41,078
Then I won't be lying down.

1054
01:45:20,122 --> 01:45:21,890
Fuck.

1055
01:45:47,149 --> 01:45:49,450
I've got you.

1056
01:45:49,483 --> 01:45:51,720
I got you. Huh.

1057
01:46:01,563 --> 01:46:02,931
Oh, shit.

1058
01:46:03,799 --> 01:46:05,399
I'm sorry, Mo.

1059
01:46:06,068 --> 01:46:07,502
I let you down.

1060
01:46:12,174 --> 01:46:13,775
God's plan.

1061
01:46:14,676 --> 01:46:15,978
God's plan?

1062
01:46:20,649 --> 01:46:23,619
Counting up to 50-plus bogies
converging on the base.

1063
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:27,421
What's our Reaper armed with?

1064
01:46:27,455 --> 01:46:29,423
She'd be using Hellfire, sir.

1065
01:46:31,593 --> 01:46:33,929
Text the pilot. Do it now.

1066
01:46:33,962 --> 01:46:36,497
What are you doing?

1067
01:46:36,531 --> 01:46:38,432
We don't have the authority.

1068
01:46:38,466 --> 01:46:42,170
Fuck the authority.
They can fire me.

1069
01:46:42,204 --> 01:46:44,640
I won't watch anymore
of our men die today.

1070
01:46:47,475 --> 01:46:51,113
Tom...

1071
01:46:51,146 --> 01:46:52,848
it's been an honor.

1072
01:46:54,917 --> 01:46:56,551
Be honest, mate.

1073
01:47:33,588 --> 01:47:35,023
Let's go home, Mo.

1074
01:47:36,258 --> 01:47:37,726
Let's go.

1075
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:04,152
Go! Quick.

1076
01:48:28,977 --> 01:48:30,045
Come on.

1077
01:48:32,247 --> 01:48:33,648
Ah. Ah.

1078
01:48:33,682 --> 01:48:35,751
We got wounded! We got wounded!

1079
01:48:35,784 --> 01:48:37,161
Keep moving. Keep
moving. Keep moving.

1080
01:48:37,185 --> 01:48:38,954
- Get a medic on it.
- Go! Let's go!

1081
01:48:38,987 --> 01:48:40,589
Let's go, let's go!

1082
01:49:31,640 --> 01:49:33,975
I will never see
my homeland again.

1083
01:49:37,979 --> 01:49:40,248
Yes, you will.

1084
01:49:40,282 --> 01:49:43,351
And I'll be with you...

1085
01:49:43,385 --> 01:49:46,321
when you find your
wife's sister.

1086
01:49:51,927 --> 01:49:53,361
Oh.

1087
01:50:56,424 --> 01:50:57,859
You may go.

1088
01:51:25,754 --> 01:51:28,190
I am glad you called.

1089
01:51:28,223 --> 01:51:32,060
The Brits want to know what
happened to the reporter.

1090
01:51:32,093 --> 01:51:36,398
When I captured that Mossad
agent in Tehran last year,

1091
01:51:36,431 --> 01:51:39,201
I told him a simple truth.

1092
01:51:39,234 --> 01:51:41,504
Spend too much time in Tehran,

1093
01:51:41,537 --> 01:51:44,306
<i>and Israel was cease to exist.</i>

1094
01:51:44,339 --> 01:51:45,974
<i>He took it as a threat.</i>

1095
01:51:46,007 --> 01:51:49,211
But it was just some
friendly advice,

1096
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:51,514
from one countryman to another.

1097
01:51:51,547 --> 01:51:53,848
<i>You have to return home...</i>

1098
01:51:55,850 --> 01:51:58,286
<i>to know what you
are fighting for.</i>

1099
01:51:59,854 --> 01:52:02,090
- Hey.
- Hey.

1100
01:52:08,263 --> 01:52:09,898
You're home.

1101
01:52:13,435 --> 01:52:16,004
What happened?

1102
01:52:16,037 --> 01:52:17,072
Nothing.

1103
01:52:22,877 --> 01:52:26,281
Ah. Well, you get so big.

1104
01:52:26,314 --> 01:52:29,451
Dad, you don't tell your teenage
daughter she's getting big.

1105
01:52:29,484 --> 01:52:31,950
Well... Well, you
know what I mean.

1106
01:52:31,975 --> 01:52:33,043
Hm.
