1
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,130
So, we keep headin' east?

2
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,900
Yeah, that's the idea.

3
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,740
Stay out of the big cities?

4
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,370
Uh-huh.

5
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,640
I think I'm tired.

6
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,080
Yeah. Me, too.

7
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,660
Here.

8
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,530
Bring it on up to the office.

9
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,460
I'm going to go check us out.

10
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,930
All right.

11
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,750
What took you so long?

12
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,340
Nothing.

13
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,590
I had a little trouble
with the maid...

14
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,360
but everything's fine now.

15
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,970
Damn.

16
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,630
8:00.

17
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,770
It's already this hot.

18
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,340
Yep.

19
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:42,610
How are we fixed for water?

20
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,710
Probably not enough.

21
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,880
Yeah.

22
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,890
There's a cooler in the back
in the office.

23
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,360
Hey.

24
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,380
Shh.

25
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,820
Aah! Aah! Aah!

26
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,390
Sarah, honey, what's wrong?

27
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,400
Huh?

28
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,270
What is it, sweetie? Hmm?

29
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,770
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

30
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,600
- Daddy.
- Daddy's here.

31
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,510
- Daddy's here.
- There were monsters.

32
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,640
No, sweetie. There's
no such thing as monsters.

33
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,380
You were just having
a bad dream.

34
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,580
What's wrong, Dad?

35
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,180
Hi, kiddo.
Sarah's just having a bad dream.

36
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,990
Oh.

37
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:42,120
I saw monsters, Jack.

38
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,990
Monsters?

39
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,720
What kind?

40
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,100
I don't know.
They came out of my closet...

41
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,690
and then
they were in the shadows.

42
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,640
Mmm, shadow monsters.

43
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,800
Well, they look pretty scary...

44
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,470
but they really
can't do anything...

45
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,140
especially
when the lights are on.

46
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,800
They're scared of the light.

47
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,810
What happened, baby?

48
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,110
- You OK?
- I'm OK.

49
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,050
Sarah had a bad dream
about monsters.

50
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,210
- Oh.
- And I was telling her...

51
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,090
that there's
no such thing as monsters.

52
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,490
Oh.

53
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,190
I'm going to turn on
my night light just in case.

54
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:16,720
That sounds like
a brilliant solution.

55
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,460
Mmm.

56
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,840
- Hey, Jack?
- Hey, Mom?

57
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,400
Morning.

58
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,000
Morning, baby.

59
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,240
Hey, hon,
the pick up still won't start.

60
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,340
You mind dropping me off
on the way in?

61
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,480
Sure.

62
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,150
- Did you feed Burrow?
- Yeah, I fed him.

63
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,520
All right. Good.

64
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,550
The night light worked,
didn't it?

65
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,530
I got it, Dad.

66
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:03,410
What do you got going today,
Jack?

67
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,740
Uh, nothing much.
A math test in a few days...

68
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,180
and I think we're playing
baseball in gym class today...

69
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,280
so I can look forward
to sucking hard in right field.

70
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,910
Well, just remember...

71
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,780
don't let the hitter
get the ball over your head...

72
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,420
Unless it's out of the park.

73
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,450
Well, yeah.

74
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,340
Bye.

75
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,650
I get off early today.
All I have...

76
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,390
is the Watsons-Willard Day
bride's tractor sale.

77
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,190
You want me to pick you up?

78
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,920
Yeah.

79
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:03,160
Then we can go to the drive-in
and make out tonight.

80
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
There hasn't been
a drive-in here...

81
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,870
since the early seventies,
but...

82
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,770
I love you.

83
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,330
I love you.

84
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,870
- Have a good one.
- You, too.

85
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,720
- Morning.
- Derek.

86
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,230
- Hey, Tom.
- Morning, Joseph.

87
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,470
That's wild.

88
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,640
- Hey, Tom.
- Morning, Pat.

89
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,310
- Hey, Mick.
- Tom.

90
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,840
Charles is going to be
a little late this morning.

91
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,680
- Is he drunk again?
- Yeah, I guess.

92
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,750
Hey, who's the craziest woman
you ever dated?

93
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,090
Me?

94
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,390
Yeah. Mick and me,
we were talking...

95
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,550
about some of the girls
we went with.

96
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,030
- Uh-huh.
- He once dated a girl...

97
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,550
who used to attack him
in the middle of the night.

98
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,070
- She what?
- Yeah.

99
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,590
She used to have
these crazy goddamn dreams...

100
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,730
where instead
of her boyfriend...

101
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,240
I was
some kind of demented killer.

102
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,180
I woke up one night, she stuck
a goddamn fork in my shoulder.

103
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:22,670
- You're kidding me.
- No. I'm spurting blood.

104
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,080
She's sitting there crying...

105
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,740
going,
"Baby, I love you, I love you."

106
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,210
So, what happened?
You broke up with her, right?

107
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,350
No, I married her.

108
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,320
Hey, it lasted six years.

109
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,230
Nobody's perfect, Tom.

110
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,500
I guess not.

111
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,900
Strike this guy out.
We got 'em. Let's go.

112
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,330
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

113
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,810
Two out.

114
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,340
One winning run
coming right up, boys.

115
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,980
- Go, Bobby!
- Whoo!

116
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,250
It's all right, Billy.

117
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,460
Look alive, look alive.

118
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:15,990
Yeah!

119
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,170
Ball.

120
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,540
Yeah, that's it.

121
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,200
He's got nothing.
He's got nothing.

122
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,900
Let's go, let's go.
One more. Come on, now.

123
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,110
Come on, Bobby.

124
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,910
Yeah. He's yours, he's yours.

125
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,320
- Oh!
- Whoo!

126
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,880
- Whoo!
- Easy, Jack. Come on, Jack.

127
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,720
Don't drop it, Jack!

128
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,620
- That's yours. Come on.
- Jinx, Jackie boy!

129
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,790
- Oh!
- Oh!

130
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,230
Game over!
Yellows win. Let's go, guys.

131
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,600
Taylor, Dietrich,
you're on equipment. Let's go.

132
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,110
Guys, come on. Let's go.

133
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,170
- Good try, Bobby.
- You was robbed, Bobby.

134
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,940
Everyone hit the showers.

135
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,310
- Awesome.
- Nice.

136
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,870
Good job.

137
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,970
Guess you think
you're hot shit, huh, Stall?

138
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,700
What? No, I don't.

139
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,900
Little hero here, huh?

140
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,770
Little superstar here.

141
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,780
Little hero saves the day
at the last minute, right?

142
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,340
Bobby, it's just a game, OK?

143
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,080
It's just stupid gym class.

144
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,280
Who you calling stupid?

145
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,380
Ahem.
No, I said gym class was stupid.

146
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,880
"No, I said gym class was..."
Listen to this little faggot.

147
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:50,490
Yeah. You're right.

148
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:54,160
I'm both little and a faggot.

149
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,530
You got me dead to rights.

150
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,000
Come on, chickenshit,
let's do this.

151
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,730
What would be the point?

152
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,740
I mean, you win.
You win, you win.

153
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,510
You've established
your alpha male standing.

154
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,280
You've established
my unworthiness.

155
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,380
But doing violence to me
just seems... ahem...

156
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,390
pointless and cruel,
don't you think?

157
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,190
Let's do this, you punk bitch.

158
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,630
Shouldn't that be little punk
ass chickenshit faggot bitch?

159
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,200
Chickenshit faggot bitch.

160
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,830
Uh-oh.

161
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,230
God!

162
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,150
Bobby is a chickenshit.

163
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,960
Hey, good looking.

164
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,940
Where are we going?

165
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,380
Well, Jack's studying
over at Judy Danvers'...

166
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,410
and Martha's
taking care of Sarah.

167
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,520
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

168
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,890
So, where are we going?

169
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,430
We never got to be teenagers
together.

170
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,800
Uh-huh.

171
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,740
I'm going to fix that.

172
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,520
What's going on in there?

173
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:31,580
Keep your shirt on. I'm coming.

174
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,070
Holy cow.

175
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,610
What?

176
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,020
Do you need some help with that,
big boy?

177
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,350
Uh... maybe.

178
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,130
Oh, my God.

179
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,930
What have you done with my wife?

180
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,500
Ready? OK!

181
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,210
Go, Wildcats!

182
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,310
No wives in here, mister.

183
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,190
Mmm.

184
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,260
- Wow.
- Shh.

185
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,320
Quiet.
My parents are in the next room.

186
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,670
Mmm.

187
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,870
You're naughty.

188
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,870
What are you doing?

189
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,540
Nothing.

190
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,220
You are such a bad boy.

191
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,120
Mm-hmm.

192
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,410
Rah, rah, sis, boom, bah.

193
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,260
Oh.

194
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,230
There wasn't much of that
in high school.

195
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,170
Ah...

196
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,240
Mmm.

197
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,410
- Uhh.
- Mmm.

198
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,420
What is it?

199
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,530
Huh?

200
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,770
I remember the moment
I knew you were in love with me.

201
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,940
I saw it in your eyes.

202
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:44,610
I can still see it.

203
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,610
Of course you can.

204
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,960
I still love you.

205
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,640
I'm the luckiest
son of a bitch alive.

206
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,310
You are the best man
I've ever known.

207
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,810
There's no luck involved.

208
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
You want to go down
and get some food or something?

209
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,500
You ever wonder
what kids did for fun...

210
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,530
on a Saturday night
a hundred years ago?

211
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,010
I don't know.

212
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,380
I guess I always figured...

213
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,940
they got into
their parents' wagon...

214
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,810
and went cruising
up and down their main drag...

215
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,680
playing loud banjo music
and acting like idiots.

216
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,980
So, you think
this is as good as it gets?

217
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,930
For us? Yeah.

218
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,020
For now.

219
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:11,760
Eventually, we... we grow up,
we get jobs, we have affairs...

220
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,860
and we become alcoholics.

221
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,370
Ahem. You know, sometimes...

222
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,380
you depress me.

223
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,250
Hey, that's what I'm good at.

224
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,930
Give me that.

225
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,340
Hey, isn't that
that Stall faggot?

226
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,930
Yeah.

227
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,600
You should go kick his ass.

228
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,310
I'm going to.

229
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,720
Who the fuck was that?

230
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,860
I don't know,
and I don't want to know.

231
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,900
Can I just say how sick I am
of these podunk towns...

232
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,410
and the goddamn podunks
who live in 'em?

233
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:29,040
Do you think
if you keep saying that...

234
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,210
it's actually going
to change anything?

235
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,550
I am so sick of this shit.

236
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:37,210
Yeah, you made that clear
about ten thousand miles ago.

237
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:38,380
Now, if you haven't got
a better idea...

238
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,450
I don't want to hear
about it anymore.

239
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,420
We are so goddamned broke.

240
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,860
Yeah, well...

241
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,870
that's easy to fix.

242
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,900
No way.

243
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,170
- Come on.
- Mm-mmm.

244
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,140
Are you going to go shoot pool
with Jerry?

245
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,400
Maybe.

246
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,670
Thanks, Tom.
Thanks, Mick... good as ever.

247
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,410
There you go.

248
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,180
See you in church.

249
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,810
Yep. Have a good evening.

250
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,050
You, too.
See you tonight, Charlotte.

251
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,950
Yeah. See you.

252
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,890
Oh, I'm sorry.

253
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,290
Aw, it's all right, old fella.

254
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,460
Just closing up, fellas.

255
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,440
Coffee, black.

256
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,210
The same. I'll have some pie...
some of that lemon meringue pie.

257
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,300
Guys, guys, I'm sorry. I'm...
We're closed.

258
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,580
I said... coffee!

259
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,910
OK.

260
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,690
I guess we can handle that.

261
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,200
It's not very fresh.

262
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,610
You can go home now, Charlotte.

263
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,510
Just leave the pie.

264
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,540
OK.

265
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,680
Billy...

266
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,430
You're going to be sticking
around for a while, honey.

267
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,660
Tom?

268
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,700
Don't fuckin' move.

269
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,750
Sir, we don't... we don't
carry much cash here.

270
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,280
You gentlemen are certainly
welcome to all of it.

271
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,880
Oh, I know that, asshole,
believe me.

272
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,050
I do know that.

273
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,150
- Aah!
- Shut up, bitch!

274
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:04,630
OK, Billy...

275
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,660
let's show this asshole
we mean business.

276
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,800
What? Her?

277
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,640
Yes, her.

278
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,080
Do her!

279
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,040
Aah!

280
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,250
Uhh.

281
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,850
- Aah!
- Uhh.

282
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,900
Unh.

283
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,930
I'm telling you,
those men were...

284
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,490
They were going to kill us.

285
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:13,370
They were going to kill us,
and if it weren't for Tom...

286
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,430
He's a hero.

287
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,840
...in conjunction with
several murders in those states.

288
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,370
Now, Tom Stall
is a family man...

289
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,780
with longstanding ties
to this community.

290
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:25,040
Tom Stall
was just another hard-working...

291
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,740
small business
owner and operator...

292
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,380
in Millbrook, Indiana,
but now...

293
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:34,550
Um, one of the guys
had a... a gun to my head...

294
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:37,030
and Tom...
He was amazing. He...

295
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,930
Hi, baby.

296
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,990
- Hey, honey.
- How you doing?

297
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,200
How are you?

298
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,000
Uhh.

299
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,640
Are you as sick of hearing
about me as I am?

300
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,240
No, I kind of like it.

301
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,840
Look.
Your picture's in the paper.

302
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,370
Oh, God.

303
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,570
Careful.

304
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,470
- Hi, guys.
- Mom.

305
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,040
Can I... Can I get up now?

306
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,050
- You got it, Dad?
- Yeah.

307
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,350
- Way to go, Tommy.
- We're all here for you, Tom.

308
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,680
Way to go, Tom.

309
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,890
- Hi, sweetie.
- Oh, that's so nice.

310
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:47,760
Thank you so much for coming.

311
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,630
We're in Millbrook,
just outside the home...

312
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,760
of American hero Tom Stall...

313
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:57,260
who's just now returning from
the hospital with his family.

314
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:03,310
Mr. Stall,
Jenny Wyatt, WRPK news.

315
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:06,150
I have a few questions for you.
How did it feel...

316
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,120
when you saw the guns
of those ruthless killers...

317
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:09,620
pointed directly at you?

318
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,520
- How did it feel?
- Yeah.

319
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,620
Not very good.

320
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,660
Not very good.

321
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,890
Were you surprised, though...

322
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,130
by your own reaction
to the situation?

323
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:27,370
Uh... what I did was...

324
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:30,030
I mean,
anybody would have done that.

325
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,570
It was just...
It was a terrible thing.

326
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,050
I think we'll all be better off
when we get past it.

327
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,740
Yeah, but you really went
beyond what the average...

328
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,880
I... I need to... I really need
to be with my family.

329
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,650
Thanks.

330
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:48,350
I'm Jenny Wyatt in Millbrook,
and that was Tom Stall...

331
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:51,950
American hero, man of few words.

332
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,100
Well, I guess that's all
we're going to get.

333
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,670
Man, it's good to be home.

334
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:05,040
I hope there won't be
too much more of that.

335
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,310
Hey, Dad, they all just
want to interview you...

336
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,040
because of what you did.

337
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:16,680
You're a hero, Dad. Ha ha!

338
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,660
No, I'm not.

339
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,020
I just got lucky... very lucky.

340
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,120
This will all blow over...

341
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,790
as soon as they find
some other hot story.

342
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,060
Yeah. Maybe the Lydons will have
another two-headed cow.

343
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,430
You guys
aren't thinking big enough.

344
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,800
<i>You could probably do
Larry King Live, Dad.</i>

345
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,770
- That would be cool.
- Oh, you stop it. Stop it.

346
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,840
Look at this... more reporters.

347
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,740
Are they still there?

348
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,770
Yeah. Now there's some car
parked across the road.

349
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,780
- They're just sitting there.
- Huh.

350
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,940
- Does anyone want some tea?
- I'll take some, Mom.

351
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,320
Yes, please.

352
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,720
Unh. Aw, jeez.

353
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,800
Hey, Edie.

354
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,000
Hi. How are you?

355
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,270
- Did you go to the shop?
- Yes, sir.

356
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,370
Hello. Hey, Bill.

357
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:20,320
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, baby. How are you?

358
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:22,980
Oh, I'm all right.
What brings you by?

359
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,390
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

360
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:27,220
Doing good. Business is great.
Just can't keep up.

361
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,230
Yeah, it's busy.

362
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,060
Oh, look, more reporters. Nice.

363
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:36,790
They don't look like reporters.

364
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,430
Grilled cheese is ready.

365
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:44,000
Got fries
and a strawberry shake.

366
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,900
Hello. Welcome to Stall's.

367
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,910
Would you gentlemen
like some coffee?

368
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,380
You're the hero.

369
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,020
Uh, I don't know, sir.
I was just...

370
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:57,250
Nah, you're the big hero.

371
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:00,590
You sure took care
of those two bad men.

372
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,960
I really don't like
talking about it, sir.

373
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,290
We're trying to get
back to normal here.

374
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,390
So, can I offer you gentlemen
some coffee?

375
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:11,030
Sure. Give me some coffee.
Make it black...

376
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,900
- Yes, sir.
- Joey.

377
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,570
And... and your friends?

378
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,200
They don't drink coffee.

379
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,410
It doesn't agree
with them... Joey.

380
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,610
- Who's Joey?
- You are.

381
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:35,280
- My name's Tom, sir.
- Of course it is.

382
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,690
Mmm. That's good coffee.

383
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:48,000
Thank you, sir.

384
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,340
If I were to find coffee
as good in Philadelphia...

385
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,240
but you know that,
don't you, Tom?

386
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,280
Heh.

387
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:01,450
No, actually, I don't.
I've never been to Philadelphia.

388
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,280
Pennsylvania? Is that where
you gentlemen are from?

389
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,420
Yeah, like you don't know.

390
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,430
Sorry.
Did... Did we know each other?

391
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,970
You tell me.

392
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,380
No.

393
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,900
We don't know each other.

394
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,640
Come on, Joey. Cut the crap.

395
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,150
My name is Tom.

396
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:35,880
Joey Cusack.
Your name is Joey Cusack.

397
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,290
You're from Philly.

398
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,920
- Mm-hmm. OK. Whatever.
- Uh-huh.

399
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,000
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you're
not going to order anything...

400
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,160
my husband and I
would appreciate it...

401
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,260
if you would be on your way.

402
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,900
We ate on the road.

403
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,960
It's all right.

404
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,560
It's OK.

405
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,940
We really are very busy here
today, as you can see.

406
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,140
Um, so if you gentlemen
aren't going to be eating...

407
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:09,280
I really should offer
your seats to paying customers.

408
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,580
Hmm.

409
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,090
Well...

410
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,220
now we're paying customers.

411
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,490
I can't take this.

412
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,130
It shouldn't be
any problem for you.

413
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,860
What is that supposed to mean?

414
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,900
Mr. Fogarty's
just making conversation here.

415
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,370
Well, whatever
you want to call it...

416
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,040
this conversation is over.

417
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,570
I think he wants us to leave,
Mr. Fogarty.

418
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,810
Do you know what he does...

419
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:38,470
when he don't like people,
Mr. Fogarty?

420
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,110
Yeah. I'm scared.

421
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:43,090
We should leave before he goes
all Dirty Harry on us.

422
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,290
I want to thank you
for the coffee, Joey.

423
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,950
It really is very good.

424
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,160
It's Tom. My name's Tom Stall.

425
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,740
Excuse me.

426
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,880
What are you doing?
Who are you calling?

427
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Hi... Hi, Molly.
This is Edie Stall. Is he in?

428
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,260
I'm fine, thanks.

429
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,850
You're calling Sam?

430
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,450
Yes.

431
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,900
Is there a problem
with my driving, officer?

432
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,400
Can I see your license, sir?

433
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,030
Sure.

434
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,300
I thought I was under the limit.

435
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,080
Is there some problem
I should know about?

436
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:23,120
What's your business
in Millbrook, sir?

437
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,920
We're tourists.

438
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,120
And what business did you have
at Stall's Diner today?

439
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,360
We heard the coffee
was terrific.

440
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:37,030
Let me make something clear
to you and to Mr. Mulligan.

441
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,500
Uh-huh?

442
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,060
This is a nice town.

443
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,540
We have nice people here.

444
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,770
We take care of our nice people.

445
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,800
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah, sure.

446
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:52,380
Don't let me see you around
again.

447
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,880
You keep up the good work,
officer.

448
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,030
Charles Roarke, Philadelphia.

449
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,660
Indicted
on three counts of murder.

450
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,670
Frank Mulligan,
out of New York...

451
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,110
indicted on one count of murder.

452
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:23,640
Questioned in relation
to dozens of acts of violence...

453
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,280
that you don't want
to hear about.

454
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:29,840
Both men work for Carl Fogarty.

455
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,720
He's the fella with the eye.

456
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,210
He spent fifteen years in prison
on several counts of assault.

457
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,820
He's suspected
in half a dozen murders...

458
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:40,230
and more disappearances.

459
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:44,760
Tom, these guys are organized
crime from the east coast.

460
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,770
Now, they're the real thing.
They're bad men.

461
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:51,400
Jesus. Jesus, honey.

462
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,370
I have to ask you a question.

463
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,740
Are you in some kind
of witness protection plan?

464
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,250
- Sam.
- Some kind of what?

465
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,780
This is no laughing matter,
Edie.

466
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,720
Of course he's not, Sam.

467
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:12,090
I'd just like to hear
Tom say that.

468
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,930
OK. No. No,
I'm not in a witness program.

469
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,870
Those men just have
the wrong guy.

470
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,970
They must've seen me on TV,
and I guess, uh...

471
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:29,170
I reminded them
of this Johnny guy.

472
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,200
- Joey.
- J-Joey somebody.

473
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,910
I mean, good lord.
The idea of me...

474
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:38,390
I never honestly believed it,
but I had to ask.

475
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:43,660
I've done some research
on this, uh, Joey Cusack.

476
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,890
I didn't find anything.

477
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:49,420
But there is a Richie Cusack
in Philadelphia.

478
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,660
Apparently, he's the head...

479
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,700
of some kind of crime syndicate
in that city.

480
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,200
Men like this come to our town
and start harassing a citizen...

481
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,570
we have to take them seriously.

482
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,270
Sure.

483
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,710
All right. So, if you folks
see them coming around...

484
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,080
you let me know.

485
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,480
Will do.

486
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,720
I'm sorry, Sam. Do you want
a piece of pie or something?

487
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,190
Ah, no, thanks, Edie.

488
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,990
I'd love to,
but I've gotta get back to work.

489
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,830
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

490
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:22,730
Uh, Sam? Thank you.

491
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,860
It's good to know
you're watching out for us.

492
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,500
Come on, Tom.

493
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,940
You know we look out
for our own here.

494
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,270
- Good night.
- Good night.

495
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,470
See ya. Thanks.

496
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,320
Huh.

497
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,820
Don't worry.

498
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,460
They're as good as gone.

499
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:06,140
Sorry. Sorry.

500
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,240
It's over and done with.

501
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,110
OK.

502
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,750
Honey. Can you get that, hon?

503
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,980
Come on, come on!

504
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,990
Hello?

505
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,860
The shotgun, Edie!
Get the shotgun!

506
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,420
Tom, Tom... Tom, what's wrong?

507
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,950
They're coming to the house!

508
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,260
Who's coming to the house?

509
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,930
Just grab it!
Do it and be ready!

510
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,130
OK, stop. Are you serious?

511
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:40,330
I'll be there as soon as I can.

512
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,270
Shit.

513
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,190
Come on.

514
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,490
Oh, shit.

515
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,290
Oh, come on.

516
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:19,270
Come on.

517
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,490
Edie! Oh.

518
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,630
Ohh, fuck. Tom!

519
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,470
Tom. Tom, what's going on?

520
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,630
- I...
- Huh?

521
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,700
I... I don't know, baby.

522
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,840
Jesus.

523
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,070
What's going on?

524
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,350
I don't... I don't know. Ohh.

525
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,150
Let me call Sam, all right?

526
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,020
- No, don't.
- OK.

527
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,250
I... I don't even know...

528
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:12,590
I... I don't know
why I thought... I...

529
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,360
Mom?

530
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,030
It's OK, baby.

531
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:27,140
Yeah. Uh... ha ha. I...

532
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,640
I... I... I think
I'm losing my mind.

533
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,340
No, no, no. OK.
You're not losing your mind.

534
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,350
You've been through
some serious trauma, all right?

535
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,350
I'm here for you, baby.
We're all here for you.

536
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,790
It's all right.
It's gonna be OK.

537
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,590
Mom?

538
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,750
You haven't forgotten about
my new shoes, have you?

539
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,420
Gosh, no. It's my top priority
for the day.

540
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,830
How could I forget?
You all right?

541
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:51,630
Yeah, yeah. Hi... Hi, sweetie.

542
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,600
Honey,
just get ready for school.

543
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,260
I'll speak to you afterwards,
all right?

544
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,800
OK.

545
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,100
Come on.

546
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,240
Let's go shopping.

547
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,250
Hey.

548
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,300
Careful. It's loaded.

549
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:38,650
Why was Mom running
around the house with that?

550
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,670
What's going on, Dad?

551
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,280
False alarm.

552
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,380
Nothing to worry about.

553
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,350
<i>I am worried.</i>

554
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:51,360
You're sweating.
You're soaked, Dad.

555
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,120
What kind of false alarm?

556
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,860
What did you mean,
you think you...

557
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,370
You think
you're losing your mind?

558
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,640
Some mob guys
showed up at the diner.

559
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:07,100
They saw me on TV, and they
came by to take a look at me.

560
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,940
Yeah.

561
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,010
Yeah, I heard about that.
Uh, so...

562
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:13,350
They thought they knew me.

563
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:19,450
They thought...
I was somebody else.

564
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:21,290
Heh. That's weird.

565
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:24,560
Yeah. Weird.

566
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,460
And I guess, um...
Well, I guess...

567
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,160
they don't like this guy
they think you are.

568
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,930
Apparently not.

569
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:37,130
And, um, and I guess I...

570
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:39,370
I guess... I guess they want...

571
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:41,500
to kill this guy
they think you are?

572
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:44,910
See, that's... that's
the losing my mind part.

573
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,440
I mean, I have no reason
to think that.

574
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,420
It's just I was down at work,
and, you know...

575
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,220
suddenly I thought
maybe... maybe...

576
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,820
they'd come looking around.

577
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,160
You know?

578
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,500
And, uh...

579
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,660
And then you came running
back here to save us?

580
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:12,330
Yeah, something silly like that.

581
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,700
I'm sorry.

582
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,610
What if you're right?

583
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:24,750
Then we deal with it.

584
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,980
OK.

585
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,470
Now, look what I just found.

586
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,570
It's my last pair in this style,
and it's exactly your size.

587
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,840
Just try these on.
They should fit like a dream.

588
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,710
How do they feel?

589
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:28,550
Good. Yeah, I think I like them.

590
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:29,980
I have a pair of these myself.

591
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,250
They look great
and they really last.

592
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,120
Really? OK. I'll take them.

593
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,630
And I needed a pair
for her as well.

594
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,990
Sarah?

595
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,160
Sarah?

596
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,070
- Uh, ma'am? The shoes...
- I have to find my daughter.

597
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,540
I can't let you leave the store
with the shoes.

598
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:51,040
OK, OK, OK. Sarah!

599
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:54,400
Sarah?

600
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,250
Sarah?

601
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:13,760
Sarah. Sarah.
Don't ever do that again, OK?

602
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,160
I'm sorry, Mommy.

603
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,290
But look.
They have the new Vespa dolls.

604
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:18,820
Nothin' to worry about,
Mrs. Stall.

605
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,730
I've been watching over her.

606
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:23,970
You stay the fuck away from
my family, you son of a bitch.

607
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:28,000
There's no need for that kind
of language, Mrs. Stall.

608
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,100
Listen to me.
I don't know what you want...

609
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,550
and I don't really care.

610
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,780
You should care about
what I want, Mrs. Stall...

611
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:36,410
because I want something
from your husband...

612
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:40,580
that might affect you,
might change your life.

613
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,790
My husband does not know you.

614
00:46:42,830 --> 00:46:45,020
He wouldn't know you,
somebody like you.

615
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:48,090
Oh, he knows Carl Fogarty,
all right.

616
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,830
He knows me intimately.

617
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,030
See? This isn't
a completely dead eye.

618
00:46:56,070 --> 00:46:58,400
It still works a bit.

619
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,810
The problem is, the only thing
I can see with it...

620
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,210
is Joey Cusack.

621
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:06,010
And it can see
right through him.

622
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:08,450
Right through your husband,
Edie.

623
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,440
See what's inside him,
what makes him tick.

624
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,580
He's still the same guy.

625
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:18,750
- No.
- He's still crazy fuckin' Joey.

626
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,520
And you know it, don't you?

627
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:24,060
I know that my husband is
Tom Stall. That's what I know.

628
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:25,430
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

629
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:28,100
Well, why don't you ask Tom
about his older brother Richie?

630
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,260
He doesn't...

631
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:33,770
Ask Tom about how he tried to
rip my eye out with barbed wire.

632
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:36,140
And ask him, Edie...

633
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:41,880
how come he's so good
at killing people?

634
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,820
If I see you within
five hundred feet of me...

635
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,320
or my children or my husband,
I'll have you arrested.

636
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,550
Heh heh heh heh.

637
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,460
Can I possibly make myself
any clearer than that?

638
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,260
No, no, Mrs. Stall, you can't.
I thank you for your time.

639
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,820
You have an enchanting daughter.

640
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,770
And, Mrs. Stall...

641
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:04,970
don't forget your shoes.

642
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:07,440
Heh heh heh heh.

643
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:08,940
So, how's your dad?

644
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,470
I don't know. A little weird.

645
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:13,280
Well, after
what he went through?

646
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,110
I mean,
actually killing someone?

647
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:19,210
I mean, that's enough
to freak anybody out.

648
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,880
Yeah. I guess.

649
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,030
So, your old man's
some kind of tough guy, huh?

650
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,190
What's he think
of his wimp son?

651
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:33,330
You think he'd take this shit?
You think he'd make jokes?

652
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:35,600
Go on, bitch.
Say something funny.

653
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,270
Bobby, leave him alone.

654
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:40,000
Shut up, skank.

655
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,670
Uh-oh. He's gettin' mad.

656
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:45,340
Jack, let's just
get out of here, OK?

657
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,140
Jack, he's an asshole.
You know that.

658
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,710
He doesn't mean shit.
Let's just go.

659
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,620
Let's just get out of here, OK?

660
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,680
Yeah, puss. Run away.

661
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:00,130
Goddamn, I bet your daddy
would be real ashamed by you.

662
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,460
Go ahead, bitch.
Say something funny.

663
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,160
Make me laugh.

664
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:23,710
- Uhh!
- Ohh!

665
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:25,550
Uhh!

666
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:31,030
OK, you motherfucker! Get
over there, you son of a bitch!

667
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,220
Ohh!

668
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,590
Come here. Are you laughin'?

669
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,390
Are you laughin' now...

670
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:39,990
you motherfucking
cocksucking piece of shit?

671
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,410
What the hell were you thinking?

672
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,610
- I wasn't thinking.
- Obviously not.

673
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,240
Bobby's been riding me
all year, Dad. He's a jerk.

674
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:56,610
He's a jerk?

675
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,680
Yeah. He's a jerk.

676
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,450
That's no excuse.
You stand up to him.

677
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,120
You don't put him
in the hospital!

678
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,290
Oh, big deal.

679
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,130
It's the best thing
anyone could've done to him.

680
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,960
Besides, I only got suspended.

681
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,760
<i>It Is a big deal!</i>

682
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,630
His parents say
they might sue us.

683
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:14,530
There could be assault charges.

684
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:15,730
We can't afford that, Jack.

685
00:50:15,770 --> 00:50:17,210
We don't have
that kind of money.

686
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,400
Oh, what?
Mom's not gonna take the case?

687
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,380
- Oh, whatever, Dad...
- Listen, smart mouth!

688
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:26,540
In this family, we do not solve
our problems by hitting people!

689
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:28,920
No, in this family,
we shoot them!

690
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:30,080
Ah!

691
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:37,860
Jack.

692
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:51,270
Honey, have you seen Jack?

693
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,500
What?

694
00:50:57,610 --> 00:50:59,670
What's wrong, baby?

695
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:06,460
Fogarty and his men
followed us to the mall.

696
00:51:06,490 --> 00:51:07,980
He what?

697
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:12,520
Call Sam.
Should... Should we call Sam?

698
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,860
We should call...

699
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,260
I already took care of it,
honey.

700
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,860
I already took care of it.
Went down to the courthouse...

701
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,030
got a restraining order.

702
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:22,130
A lot of good that'll do.

703
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:25,200
Well, it's something.

704
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,070
At least
we could have him arrested...

705
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,700
if he ever
comes around here again.

706
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,440
You're right.

707
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,220
But I have to tell you
something.

708
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,220
What?

709
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,920
This man Fogarty
really believes...

710
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,460
that you're this Joey Cusack.

711
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,490
I mean, the things that
he told me this afternoon...

712
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:56,060
- What things?
- Things. Just bullshit.

713
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:01,540
But he's, uh,
he's sure that it's you.

714
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:04,240
And we have to convince him
that it's not.

715
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:09,310
Well, I don't think he's
interested in examining my DNA.

716
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,970
Get off our property.

717
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:33,410
We'll go, Joey.

718
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:35,430
We just want you
to come with us.

719
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:38,610
Come back to Philly,
see some people.

720
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:41,850
I told you, I have never been
to Philadelphia.

721
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:45,080
Heh. You almost believe
your own crap, don't you?

722
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,580
You know, you're trying so hard
to be this other guy.

723
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,680
It's painful to watch.

724
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,790
- Charlie.
- Hey.

725
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:57,230
Look what we found.

726
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,330
Come on.

727
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:00,630
Yeah? Ha ha ha.

728
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:02,160
- Mom!
- Jack!

729
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:04,610
- No! Edie! Edie!
- Mom!

730
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,610
- Edie! No! No!
- Jack!

731
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,410
Let go, you son of a bitch!

732
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,710
Come here.

733
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,210
Wait.

734
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,380
Mom.

735
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,920
Don't make us hurt the kid,
Joey.

736
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,250
We just want you to come
for a little trip with us...

737
00:53:21,290 --> 00:53:22,880
down Memory Lane.

738
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:26,450
Put the popgun down.
Come over and talk to us.

739
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,960
Baby, wait.

740
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,430
Edie... I will get him.

741
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:34,230
I'll get him. Please.

742
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,140
Go up to Sarah.

743
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:39,160
Go up to her. Do it.

744
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,520
Put the gun down.

745
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,120
Put it down, Joey.

746
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,770
Come closer.

747
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,230
A little further.

748
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,280
Come on.

749
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,990
Go back to the house, Jack.

750
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,500
Go on.

751
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:57,080
You see how cozy it can be
when you decide to play nice?

752
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:00,580
Now, come on, Joey.
Get in the car.

753
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:03,890
You won't need your toothbrush.
We'll take care of everything.

754
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:07,160
I think it'd be better
if you'd just leave now.

755
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:14,400
Joey.

756
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,050
Come on, Joey, let's go.

757
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,880
Ahh!

758
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,910
- Uhh!
- Uhh! Uhh!

759
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,550
Ohh! Ohh!

760
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,020
Uhh!

761
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:43,790
Tom!

762
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:50,700
Fuck.

763
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,800
Mommy, what's wrong?

764
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:05,720
It's OK.

765
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,420
You got anything to say
before I blow your brains out...

766
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:14,050
you miserable prick?

767
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,290
I should've killed you
back in Philly.

768
00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:27,410
Yeah, Joey.

769
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,570
You should have.

770
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,290
Uhh! Uhh.

771
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:11,710
Edie.

772
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,850
Honey, are you OK?

773
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:24,790
Tell me the truth.

774
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,490
The truth?

775
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:35,500
Please.
You can do that, can't you?

776
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:42,340
You can do that, can't you?
Please?

777
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,610
What do you think you heard?

778
00:58:44,650 --> 00:58:47,580
It's not what I heard.

779
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,210
It's what I saw.

780
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:55,850
I saw Joey.

781
00:58:55,890 --> 00:59:00,120
I saw you turn into Joey
right before my eyes.

782
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,030
I saw a killer...
the one Fogarty warned me about.

783
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:10,730
You did kill men
back in Philly, didn't you?

784
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,340
Did you do it for money...

785
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,000
or did you do it
because you enjoyed it?

786
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:20,110
Joey did, both. I didn't...

787
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:21,580
Tom Stall didn't.

788
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:31,120
Oh, God.

789
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,650
Oh, my God.

790
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:45,860
Oh, God, it's really happening.

791
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:47,540
Oh.

792
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,280
What are you, like, some
multiple personality schizoid?

793
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,980
It's like flipping a switch
back and forth for you?

794
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:58,710
I never expected
to see Joey again.

795
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,550
Oh, yeah. Joey.

796
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,580
What, was he in hiding?
Was he dead?

797
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:05,360
I thought he was.

798
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:07,260
I thought I killed Joey Cusack.

799
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,260
I went out to the desert,
and I killed him.

800
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,420
Oh, my God.

801
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:14,960
I spent three years
becoming Tom Stall.

802
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,030
Edie, you have to know this.

803
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:20,700
I wasn't really born again
until I met you.

804
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,880
I was nothing.

805
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,410
I don't believe you.

806
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,680
I can't believe
this is happening.

807
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,190
I can't believe
this is happening.

808
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:37,250
I can't believe
this is fucking happening!

809
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:41,660
You didn't grow up in Portland.

810
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:44,890
And you never talk about
your adopted parents...

811
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,330
because you don't have any!

812
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,470
And our name.

813
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:54,240
Jesus Christ, my name.

814
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,840
Jack's name. Sarah's name?

815
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,370
Stall? Tom Stall?

816
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:05,750
Did you just make that up?

817
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:08,260
Where did that name come from?

818
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,220
I mean...

819
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,530
it was available.

820
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,030
Yeah.

821
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:29,840
I guess I was available, too.

822
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,620
Hey, Jack.

823
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:18,120
What am I supposed
to call you now?

824
01:02:21,230 --> 01:02:23,600
You're supposed to call me Dad.

825
01:02:23,630 --> 01:02:25,290
That's what I am... your dad.

826
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:26,800
Are you really?

827
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:31,770
So, you're some kind of
closet mobster dad?

828
01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:34,000
I mean, if I go rob
Millikan's Drug Store...

829
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:37,310
will you ground me if I don't
give you a piece of the action?

830
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:39,870
What, Dad? You tell me.

831
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,150
Please, son. Don't.

832
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:46,640
If I talk to Sam about you,
will you have me whacked?

833
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:51,620
Jack.

834
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,210
Tom?

835
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:56,620
Hey, Sam. How are you doing?

836
01:03:56,660 --> 01:03:58,220
Good to see you up and around.

837
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,390
- Yeah.
- You had her runnin' yet?

838
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:03,630
Yeah, for a second there.

839
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:06,160
She's coming back to life.

840
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:09,100
Ah, shit.

841
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:12,630
Tom...

842
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:17,410
I got a problem.

843
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:21,710
Want to come inside
for a minute?

844
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:30,780
I've been running through it all
for the last couple days.

845
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,560
It just doesn't fit.

846
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:39,000
What doesn't fit?

847
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:40,060
None of it.

848
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,400
Is that Edie coming home?

849
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,270
Yeah.

850
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:53,610
Well, we don't have
to do this now.

851
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:56,850
Might as well.

852
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,750
Hi, Sam.

853
01:05:03,790 --> 01:05:05,490
Edie.

854
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:07,290
How you doing?

855
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:09,560
I'm OK.

856
01:05:11,330 --> 01:05:12,800
You want some coffee?

857
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,430
No, I'm good.

858
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,130
So, what brings you out here?

859
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:22,110
Well, Tom and I
were just talking about that.

860
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:25,480
Mmm. I'd like to hear it.

861
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,580
Well, it's just that...

862
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:32,980
none of this makes any sense.

863
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:34,790
Mmm.

864
01:05:34,820 --> 01:05:36,420
These are serious secretive men.

865
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:37,520
I mean, they wouldn't have
come out here...

866
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:39,050
they wouldn't have
gone through all this...

867
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:41,620
exposed themselves like this...

868
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:44,500
unless they were dead certain
they had the right man.

869
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:49,130
So, what are you saying, Sam?

870
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:56,140
I'm saying I think
I need to hear the truth.

871
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:59,970
The truth?

872
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:07,150
The truth.

873
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:17,900
Sam, you've got
too much time on your hands.

874
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:20,190
I'm sorry?

875
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:23,800
Tom is...

876
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,070
Tom is who he says he is.

877
01:06:27,110 --> 01:06:29,600
That's all that really matters.

878
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:33,710
Sam, hasn't this family
suffered enough?

879
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:40,520
Well...

880
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,150
goddamn.

881
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:47,190
Edie.

882
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:48,590
It's OK.

883
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:54,200
I guess I'll be going.

884
01:07:00,510 --> 01:07:02,940
You folks give me a ring
if you need anything.

885
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:10,520
Anything at all, understand?

886
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:23,190
Thanks.

887
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:25,890
You...

888
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:30,900
Edie. Edie!

889
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:32,930
- Get off of me!
- Unh!

890
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:39,840
Fuck you, Joey!

891
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,010
Aah! Get off!

892
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:49,090
Uhh!

893
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,420
Uhh!

894
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,440
Ohh!

895
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:53,450
Ohh. Ohh.

896
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,100
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

897
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:12,630
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

898
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:16,480
Mmm.

899
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:39,970
Uhh.

900
01:10:34,990 --> 01:10:36,220
Uhh.

901
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:42,830
Uhh.

902
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:52,470
Hello.

903
01:10:52,510 --> 01:10:55,000
Hey, bro-ham.

904
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,940
You're still pretty good
with the killing.

905
01:10:57,980 --> 01:10:59,910
That's exciting.

906
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:02,310
Richie.

907
01:11:02,350 --> 01:11:06,190
Yeah, it's Richie.
What do you say, Joey?

908
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:08,210
Are you going to come see me?

909
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:10,590
Or do I have to come see you?

910
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,540
What's that supposed to mean?

911
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:48,910
Uh, Jenny Cream.

912
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:50,920
Bottle.

913
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:33,660
You Ruben?

914
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,930
Yeah.

915
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,160
You Joey?

916
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:50,500
Yeah, I'm Joey.

917
01:14:53,750 --> 01:14:55,410
So, what do we do now?

918
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:00,420
You finish your beer...

919
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:03,020
then I take you to see Richie
in the Escalade.

920
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:27,150
Nice houses.

921
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:30,350
Richie's
a very upscale kind of guy.

922
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:48,470
Nice gate.

923
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,630
Yeah.

924
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:25,070
We're here.

925
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:28,740
Home, sweet home.

926
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:00,530
Got to frisk you.

927
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:02,540
Nah. I'll save you the trouble.

928
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:03,810
I'm not packing.

929
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:06,880
I got to frisk you.

930
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,650
All right.

931
01:17:11,690 --> 01:17:13,480
I don't smell very good.

932
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,580
I've been driving
pretty much non-stop...

933
01:17:15,620 --> 01:17:17,850
fifteen to sixteen hours.

934
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:20,120
I'll hold my nose.

935
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:34,370
Can you believe that place
is still standing...

936
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:36,640
the Track and Turf?

937
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:45,410
Didn't you bang
Jill Levy there...

938
01:17:45,450 --> 01:17:48,050
right on the bar
in front of everybody?

939
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:50,720
I never banged Jill Levy.

940
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:57,230
Well, you should've.
She was... She was something.

941
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:08,400
How you doing, Richie?

942
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:14,810
Mmm.

943
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:29,320
Yeah.

944
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,660
It's been a long, long time,
bro-ham.

945
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:45,650
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

946
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,940
Come with me.

947
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:03,560
- You want anything?
- Nah.

948
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:11,400
So, you like that farm life?

949
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:15,210
Milking cows and shit?

950
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:18,300
I don't have a farm.

951
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:20,440
No?

952
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:24,540
Fogarty thought you lived
on some kind of farm.

953
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:30,110
Said you could smell pig.

954
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:32,180
How that old fart would know...

955
01:19:32,230 --> 01:19:33,590
what a pig smells like,
I don't know...

956
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:34,790
but that's what he said.

957
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:41,500
Ahem.

958
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:43,560
Do you like being married?

959
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:45,370
What?

960
01:19:45,410 --> 01:19:47,500
Do you like being married?

961
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,040
Does it work for you?

962
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,950
I can't see it working for me.

963
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:57,250
I never felt the urge, you know?

964
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:00,150
A lot of great looking women
in the world.

965
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:04,560
I never met one made me
want to give up all the others.

966
01:20:04,590 --> 01:20:06,180
Sure, you can fuck around...

967
01:20:06,230 --> 01:20:08,630
but it's so much goddamn work,
you know?

968
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,720
Keeping it quiet.

969
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:12,790
It's not worth the effort.

970
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:15,830
Don't see the upside.

971
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:18,630
You see the upside, Joey?

972
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:22,140
Yeah, Richie, I do.

973
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:25,380
I do now.

974
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:31,150
I'm pretty pissed at you,
bro-ham.

975
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:34,650
You could've called.

976
01:20:34,690 --> 01:20:39,720
You could've dropped a postcard
in the mail.

977
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,730
We're brothers.
What'd you think would happen?

978
01:20:56,440 --> 01:20:59,570
I thought that business
would come first.

979
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:01,510
Well, yeah.

980
01:21:02,550 --> 01:21:05,020
Yeah, I know.

981
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:07,850
Tch. I know.

982
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,320
What am I going to do?

983
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,420
You bust up a made man's place.

984
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:17,520
You killed some of his guys.

985
01:21:17,570 --> 01:21:20,030
You take his eye.

986
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:23,730
Jesus, Joey, you took his eye.

987
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:26,570
Barbed wire, wasn't it?

988
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:30,170
That's disgusting.
You always were the crazy one.

989
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:33,180
- Not anymore.
- Yeah, I heard.

990
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:34,810
You're living
the American dream.

991
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:36,820
You really bought into it,
didn't you?

992
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:38,750
You've been this other guy...

993
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:42,090
almost as long
as you've been yourself.

994
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:49,020
Hey, when you dream...

995
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:52,500
are you still Joey?

996
01:21:53,770 --> 01:21:55,930
Joey's been dead a long time.

997
01:21:55,970 --> 01:21:58,230
And yet here you sit...

998
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,240
big as life.

999
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:06,310
You know you cost me...

1000
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:09,810
a lot of time and money.

1001
01:22:09,850 --> 01:22:12,410
Before you pulled that shit
with Fogarty...

1002
01:22:12,450 --> 01:22:15,050
I was a shoe-in to take over...

1003
01:22:15,090 --> 01:22:18,680
when the boss croaked...
a shoe-in.

1004
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:21,520
It was made very clear to me,
Joey.

1005
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,000
I had to clean up your mess...

1006
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:27,400
or nothing was ever
going to happen for me.

1007
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:31,390
You got no idea
how much shit I had to pull...

1008
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,600
to get back in with those guys.

1009
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,110
You cost me...

1010
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,340
a hell of a lot, Joey,
a hell of a lot.

1011
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:50,090
Looks like you're doing
all right over here.

1012
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:53,720
Yeah, I am, I am.

1013
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:58,130
I'm still behind
the eightball...

1014
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:00,000
because of you.

1015
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:02,030
There's a certain
lack of respect...

1016
01:23:02,070 --> 01:23:04,600
a certain lack of trust.

1017
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:11,130
The boys in Boston are
just waiting for me to go down.

1018
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:19,880
You always were
a problem for me, Joey.

1019
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,250
When Mom brought you home
from the hospital...

1020
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:25,050
I tried to strangle you
in your crib.

1021
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:28,460
I guess all kids try to do that.

1022
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:30,460
She caught me...

1023
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:33,800
whacked the daylights out of me.

1024
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,570
I've heard that story.

1025
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,500
Well, what do you think?

1026
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:49,050
Better late than never?

1027
01:23:49,080 --> 01:23:50,850
Richie...

1028
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:55,660
I'm here to make peace.

1029
01:23:55,690 --> 01:23:59,460
Tell me what I got to do
to make things right.

1030
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,820
You could do something, I guess.

1031
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:11,630
You could die, Joey.

1032
01:24:29,720 --> 01:24:31,020
Ooh!

1033
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:35,090
Uhh!

1034
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:36,290
Uhh!

1035
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:38,030
- Unh!
- Oh!

1036
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:44,160
Oh!

1037
01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:45,430
Uhh!

1038
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:49,710
Uhh! Ohh!

1039
01:25:07,930 --> 01:25:09,620
How do you fuck that up?

1040
01:25:10,670 --> 01:25:11,790
Uhh!

1041
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:15,860
How do you fuck that up?

1042
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:36,180
What are you going to do,
give him mouth-to-mouth?

1043
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:38,920
Did you see my brother?

1044
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:40,190
Fuckin' leave this...

1045
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:43,930
and let's just kill
that little fuck!

1046
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:47,930
Jesus, Joey.

1047
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:13,380
Jesus, Richie.
