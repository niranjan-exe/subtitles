867

But in the fleeting time they Dream walk,

868

they can do irreparable damage
to the universe they invade.

But I do wonder

01:05:43,193 --> 01:05:46,738
when you could force America
to send you to any universe you want,

1164
01:05:46,905 --> 01:05:48,782
why take her power for your own?
