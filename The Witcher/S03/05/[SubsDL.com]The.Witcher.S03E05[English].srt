I heard they put an aphrodisiac
in the wine.

Are you surprised?

Did you see what Sabrina was wearing,
by the way?

or run Stregobor through
with the nearest ice sculpture.

20
00:01:54,166 --> 00:01:56,125

[woman] Mmm!

[man] That's right!

- No.

- It's all for us.

Get used to it.
They'll be watching us all night.

00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,375
Oh. Good.

32
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,500
Now, you should know the territory
before we step in.

33
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:43,416
Over there, we have Sabrina Glevissig
and Marti Sodergren.

34
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,300
- They're... passionate.
- ...have some fun...

35

By the fountain, we have Margarita
Laux-Antille, current headmistress.

00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:56,458
And Keira Metz. Quite the spitfire.

We have Carduin, Bianca, Marquard,

Detmold and his brother Drithelm,

39

Artaud Terranova,
good mage, even better drunk.

41
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:10,583
Vilgefortz, who's grown on me
despite my best efforts.

42
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,791
Tissaia de Vries,
whom you already know.

00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:14,333
And Gerhart of Aelle.

- I was saying...
- What?

45
00:03:15,375 --> 00:03:17,208
- The oldest living sorcerer.
- [sighs]

46
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,125
Are you expecting me
to remember all those names?

47
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,208
I thought you went to Oxenfurt?

48
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,500
Hmm.

49
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:32,291
Don't even think about it.

I gave you my word.

52
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,458
She's safe in Loxia until dawn.

53
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,250
When the ball ends
and the true conclave begins...

54
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:47,708
- [Geralt sighs]
- ...then we'll make our move.

55
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:51,291
Tonight it's all about loosening spirits.

56
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,500
And inspiring conviviality
in one perfect evening.

57
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,791
- So behave yourself.
- I always behave myself.

58
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,916
You have no memory of my party in Rinde?

59
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,583
To say nothing of enchanted hedgehogs
and the Law of Surprise?

60
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:05,916
That was complicated.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,375
Well, this is simple.

62
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,250
We need this ball
to go off without a hitch,

63
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,708
so please... dearest,

64
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,916
stop eating like an underfed ghoul.

65
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:20,416
When someone asks to speak to you,
you must accept, and quickly.

66
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:26,458
And no matter how ludicrously
anyone is dressed, don't stare.

Yennefer.

68
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,916
And her witcher.

69
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,125
We haven't yet had the pleasure.

70
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:44,291
Geralt, this is Sabrina Glevissig
of Ard Carraigh, a school friend of mine.

71
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:47,958
We've welcomed our share of spies,
thieves, and murderers at Aretuza,

72
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,250
but not yet hosted a witcher.

73
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,416
- Huh.
- Yen's been hiding you for far too long.

I think Yen looks particularly lovely
this evening. Don't you?

82
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:25,375
And he's not even lying. How dull.

83
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,833
- Sabrina, that's no way to treat a guest.
- Hmm.

84
00:05:27,916 --> 00:05:29,875
He has so little experience in telepathy.

85
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:33,833
Why did you bring your pet along,
if not for us to, uh...

86
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,291
play with him?

87
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,833
Dearest, why don't you go and get a drink?

00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,166
That's a great idea.

What on earth
do you think you're playing at?

90

- Yen, do you know what's better than sex?
- What?

91
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,708
Getting a rise
out of the Savior of Sodden.

Of course. Only a fool would trust

00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,416
No, not at all.

159
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,416
Best of luck tomorrow
at the conclave, witcher.

160
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:36,250
[door opens]

161
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,958
[wistful music]

162
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,041
- Where have you been?
- What did Istredd say?

163
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,041
[music stops]

164
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:55,166
- We don't have time for that.
- The Melange is about to begin!

165
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,208
[cheering and applause]

166
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,125
Come on, girl. Yes, yes, yes.

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,916
- [laughter and squeals]
- [woman 1] Yes!

168
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,583
- [Keira] Come on. Artaud!
- Keira.

169
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,666
[Keira chuckles] Yennefer.

170
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,166
[man] Would you care...

171
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:10,583
- Yes.
- [man] Would you, my fair lady?

172
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,750
[Geralt] What's the Melange?

173
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:13,833
It's a dance.

174
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,000
It's not optional.

175
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,291
[sultry music]

176
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,708
Geralt.

177
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,541
Are you enjoying your evening?

178
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,291
Good.

179
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,083
Oh, witcher! [laughing]

180
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,208
I've been waiting
to get my hands on you all evening.

181
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:05,125
I studied as a contortionist, you know?
I'm quite bendy.

182
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,750
I hope we can count on
your support tomorrow, Artorius.

183
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,000
You might, Yennefer.
Although I've not forgotten your past.

184
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:14,041
Nor the kings who are still waiting
on a particular princess.

185
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,500
[Yennefer] Of course,
but my priorities have changed.

186
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:17,583
I'm here to help.

187
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:21,416
We'll see. I've found trying to predict
the actions of Yennefer of Vengerberg

188
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,083
as hopeless
as seeking a black cat in a coal cellar.

189
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,333
They are worrisome.

190
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,416
- Have you tried the wine yet?
- I'm not thirsty.

191
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Aww.

192
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,041
Geralt.

193
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,416
Istredd.

194
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:14,458
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the neck-breaking chaperone.

195
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,333
- I know. I owe you an apology.
- [scoffs]

196
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,875
- Perhaps a drink later?
- [scoffs] I can't.

197
00:12:20,916 --> 00:12:23,041
I plan on getting pregnant tonight.

198
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,458
[chuckles]

199
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,958
Exciting times ahead, don't you think?

200
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,333
[both laugh]

201
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:44,916
[Triss sighs]

202
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,750
It's good to see you, Triss.

203
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:49,500
You too.

204
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,375
How is Ciri?

205
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,208
She's safe. For now.

206
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,541
[music finishes]

207
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,916
[applause]

208
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,833
[cheering and whooping]

209
00:13:58,625 --> 00:13:59,666
[man] Well played!

210
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,291
Thank you.

211
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,083
- [Sabrina] That was marvelous.
- [Valdo] Thank you.

212
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,166
Geralt.

213
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:11,559
- [Sabrina] I've never seen...
- [man] Wonderful!

214
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,309
- [woman 1] Exciting!
- [woman 2] Yes, well...

215
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,083
Artaud, have you sampled
the wine this evening?

216
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,000
- Ah, you know me too well.
- I think you're ready for another.

217
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:22,166
[Geralt] You've been trying to win Yen
back all evening. Do you deny it?

218
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,083
Why the fuck would I deny it?

219
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,458
- She knows I'm the better man!
- Ooh!

220
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,833
Then prove it.

221
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,708
[guests gasp]

222
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,000
Unbelievable.

223
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,125
Coward.

224
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,583
[Istredd coughing]

225
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,750
- [guests gasp]
- [Geralt grunts]

226
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,291
[chuckling]

227
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:00,083
- [Sabrina laughing]
- Whew!

228
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,750
- [woman] Finally, some entertainment.
- [man] The witcher is...

229
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,500
I promised Yen
I wouldn't make a mess of this evening.

230
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,833
[man] Make a mess of him!

231
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,583
- [Geralt] So I won't.
- [woman groans]

232
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,166
Truce?

233
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:15,625
Oh shit!

234
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,500
- [laughter]
- [woman] Who gave him champagne?

235
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,416
- [man] Look at you!
- [Artaud yelps]

236
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,166
[Sabrina] Artaud's wasted again!

237
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,750
[Yennefer chuckles]

238
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,416
A fight was quite the creative choice.

239
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,666
- Just admit that you loved it.
- [laughs]

240
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:40,041
As duels in my honor go, this one
certainly broke into the top three.

241
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,541
Oh, well, it was an honor

242
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,666
to fight for the capricious heart
of Yennefer of Vengerberg.

243
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:49,000
And I hope to fight
many more battles with you, my dear.

244
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:52,416
With me, or against me?

245
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,583
Depends on the evening.

246
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,083
[Geralt sighs]

247
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,750
I shouldn't like to lose you, Yen.

248
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,875
But you have me.

249
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,375
Tonight will end.

250
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,208
Everything ends.

251
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,833
[Tissaia] And now, to bring
this wonderful evening to a close,

252
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,583
a toast!

253
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,500
To peace amongst mages of the North!

254
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:29,000
[all] To peace!

255
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,791
There is much work to be done tomorrow.

256
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,791
But Tissaia and I are optimistic
about the future of this Continent,

257
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:40,041
based on what we've seen here tonight.

258
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,000
To peace!

259
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,666
[all] To peace!

260
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:50,708
And we have Yennefer of Vengerberg
to thank.

261
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:53,125
[cheering and applause]

262
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:54,416
[man] Yennefer!

263
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,250
[Gerhart] Whoo! Brilliant.

264
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:01,833
To us.

265
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,416
And a <i>nearly </i>perfect evening.

266
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,000
- ...everyone.
- That was good.

267
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,125
So.

268
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,125
Now what?

269
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,291
Hmm.

270
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,375
- What a night indeed.
- [chuckles]

271
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,000
I can't believe they bought it.

272
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,833
I thought our performance
was quite convincing.

273
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:26,041
And a good thing, too. Philippa was
watching the whole ballroom like a hawk.

274
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,125
She comes by it naturally.

275
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:32,625
We weren't the only ones plotting tonight.
I could tell from the moment we entered.

276
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,208
[Geralt] Hmm.

277
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,833
Lilac and gooseberries.

278
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,500
Now, that I can tolerate.

279
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:42,958
Are you sure about this?

280
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,500
Are you?

281
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,583
...finding spell.

282
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:55,083
- Just a courtesy.
- Hmm...

283
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,833
Oh yes, here they are.

284
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,166
I don't know which I'd like more,
to tear this costume off

285
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,000
or run Stregobor through
with the nearest ice sculpture.

286
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:10,041
I know, and I hate the fucker
just as much as you do.

287
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:11,958
But here,
we need to do things differently.

288
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,916
The nearest serving fork, then.

289
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:18,541
Or... rather than murder
an esteemed member of the Brotherhood

290
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,125
in front of the entire North,

291
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,416
we wait.

292
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,833
- We seek out proof tonight.
- [sighs]

293
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:27,541
We expose Stregobor
at the conclave tomorrow.

294
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,958
He'll be put on trial.

295
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,041
Until then, we have to play nicely

296
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,833
if you-know-who's going to have
any kind of a future here.

297
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,458
I saw what he did to those girls, Yen.

298
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,666
I won't be leaving
until I know she's safe here.

299
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,333
I hear you. But, Geralt...

300
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,791
trust me.

301
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:50,375
- [musicians stomping]
- Mmm.

302
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,083
[lively, intriguing music]

303
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,916
The witcher!

304
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,041
Is there always this much staring?

305
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,125
No. It's all for us.

306
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:17,916
Get used to it.
They'll be watching us all night.

307
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,166
Hmm. Good.

They didn't teach it at Aretuza.

[Stregobor] <i>I'll take that, half-breed!</i>

475
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,666
[Stregobor] <i>You don't belong here!</i>

476
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,458
- Hate to interrupt.
- [gasps]

477
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,208
Stregobor, you piece of shit.

478
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:09,458
You never gave a damn
about unity, did you?

479
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:13,125
Mere smoke and mirrors
to hide what you'd returned to do.

480
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:14,833
Raze Aretuza to the ground.

481
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,166
Your kind never changes.

482
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,791
And yet, our feckless leaders
forgive and forgive.

483
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,375
Well, mercy isn't my cup of tea.

484
00:29:23,458 --> 00:29:24,708
[Geralt] Nor mine.

485
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,625
You've been hard at work, haven't you?

486
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:30,750
Corrupting portals, kidnapping novices.

487
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:32,875
Torturing those young women
to get to Ciri.

488
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:35,208
This doesn't concern you, witcher.

489
00:29:35,291 --> 00:29:38,208
And I don't care two rat tails
about that Cintran brat.

490
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:40,958
With any luck,
she lies dead in a ditch by now.

491
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:43,875
That Cintran brat has more power
than you could dream of.

492
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,666
Or you could dream of. You have no idea
what you're dealing with here.

493
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,833
The only threat you pose
is in your dirty blood.

494
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:55,291
You're a monster who will soon
meet her reckoning. But the girl...

495
00:29:56,833 --> 00:30:00,791
The girl will most likely leave this world

496
00:30:00,875 --> 00:30:03,333
by your own mutant hands, Butcher.

497
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:05,916
- I'll kill you myself.
- [Tissaia] Stop!

498
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,666
[Triss] We came as soon as
we realized you were both gone.

499
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:16,500
- Now would be the time to explain.
- Yes. Please, do.

500
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,250
Stregobor has been keeping
a list of elven students

501
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,833
and their belongings.

502
00:30:22,916 --> 00:30:25,916
The ones who went missing
this month. Nissa.

503
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,583
- Elisabet.
- Teryn.

504
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:31,583
He's been conducting experiments.

505
00:30:31,666 --> 00:30:33,166
Practicing mind control.

506
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,333
What? That's absurd!

507
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,875
He tried to kill me
using a botched portal.

508
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:39,083
[splutters]

509
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,083
Are you really gonna believe
a word she says?

510
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:46,583
And we believe his ultimate aim
is set on Cirilla of Cintra.

511
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:50,958
- You have proof of this?
- [Triss] We do.

512
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:57,503
[Stregobor] What are you expecting
to find there?

513
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:14,666
[Istredd] <i>The Book of Monoliths.</i>
An ancient elven tome.

514
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,583
But...

515
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:17,947
Rumored to contain knowledge
since before the Conjunction.

516
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,875
[Stregobor] But...

517
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:21,791
This holds the key to how
the human sphere collided with the elves'.

518
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,833
More importantly,
how humans could get rid of elves again.

519
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:27,250
And you stole it. Didn't you?

520
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:30,916
Do I want to rid these halls
of you and your ilk? Yes.

521
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,375
- But speculating that I...
- But nothing.

522
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,416
These are serious allegations.

523
00:31:38,208 --> 00:31:40,708
I propose Stregobor is held
until the conclave concludes

524
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:42,750
and we can have a full trial.

525
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:45,833
- I concur.
- [scoffs] Yes, of course <i>you </i>do.

526
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,000
Artorius?

527
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:55,250
You've turned against our own
in a time of unity, Stregobor.

528
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,500
I cannot stand by you today.

529
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,041
Get off me! You're deranged!

530
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:02,666
All of you!

531
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:05,125
A pack of lies!

532
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:07,083
I'll hide this for safekeeping.

533
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:10,708
Make sure it doesn't
fall into the wrong hands again.

534
00:32:17,708 --> 00:32:19,333
You've saved the night.

535
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:22,041
And you too.

536
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,041
Let's go and enjoy our party.

537
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:36,166
She'll be missing this.

538
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,208
I need a drink.

539
00:32:42,791 --> 00:32:44,125
Or twelve. [sighs]

540
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,375
A toast!

541
00:32:48,291 --> 00:32:51,541
To peace amongst mages of the North!

542
00:32:51,625 --> 00:32:54,291
[all] To peace!

543
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,250
[Sabrina] Hmm.

544
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:57,666
There is much work to be done tomorrow,

545
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,541
but Tissaia and I are optimistic
about the future of the Continent,

546
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,916
based on what we've seen here tonight.

547
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:05,833
To peace!

548
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,041
[all] To peace!

549
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
And we have Yennefer of Vengerberg
to thank!

550
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,750
- [cheering and applause]
- [woman] To Yen!

551
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:19,666
- [Sabrina] Mmm.
- [Dijkstra] Mm-hmm.

552
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:27,958
To us.

553
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:31,458
And a <i>nearly </i>perfect evening.

554
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,166
I love you.

555
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,250
That's the first time
you've ever said that.

556
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:46,541
It can't be.

557
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,500
You used to think it.

558
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,500
But tonight, you actually said it.

559
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:57,666
You can kiss me now.

560
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,000
In front of everyone.

561
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:14,041
[breathing shakily]

562
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,458
[whispers] It's our first
night out together.

563
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:20,875
And all I can think about
is getting you alone.

564
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:26,875
[chuckles]

565
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,500
[gentle splashing]

566
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,833
[Geralt] This I can also tolerate.

567
00:34:31,916 --> 00:34:32,916
[Yennefer chuckles]

568
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:36,041
It took far too long
to get you back in a bathtub.

569
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,666
[both chuckle]

570
00:34:40,375 --> 00:34:42,041
Did we actually pull it off?

571
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,083
Hmm... It's hard to say.

572
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,833
- Can't get Philippa out my head.
- How do you mean?

573
00:34:51,416 --> 00:34:53,416
When I visited her in Redania,

574
00:34:53,916 --> 00:34:55,750
she said I was one of them.

575
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:58,666
But tonight,
it's like she wanted me on her side.

576
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:02,250
- Her side of what?
- She didn't say.

577
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:06,333
Tell me everything.

578
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:09,000
Care for a stroll? Alone.

579
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:12,250
<i>♪ Her whisper dancing in my ear ♪</i>

00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,041

I just live
for nights like this, don't you?

585
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,500
If this is about Ciri,
you're not getting your hands on her.

586
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,333
- Hmm!
<i>- ♪ A flower's sweetest bud... ♪</i>

All in due time, Yen.

588
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:36,583
But that is not why I pulled you away.

589
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:41,833
Hmm. Poor thing.

590
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,916
Lydia van Bredevoort?

591
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,041
[Philippa] Mmm.

592
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:47,875
Heartsick, I've recently learned.

593
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,208
She'd follow her lover anywhere,

594
00:35:50,291 --> 00:35:52,791
even blindly towards death,
if he asked it of her.

595
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:56,666
I wondered if you knew the truth.

596
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:00,666
What happened between Tissaia and I.

597
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:06,125
Tissaia told me the friendship went cold.
She never shared the details.

598
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,333
Oh.

599
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,583
- Her loyalty is hard earned.
<i>- ♪ All is not... ♪</i>

600
00:36:11,666 --> 00:36:13,958
- And hard lost.
<i>- ♪ As it seems ♪</i>

601
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:16,666
We only grew closer as the years went by.

602
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:19,541
Until the days
leading up to the First Northern War.

603
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:20,500
Sodden?

604
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:21,958
[applause]

605
00:36:22,041 --> 00:36:24,875
I tried to convince Tissaia not to go.

606
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:28,000
Not to ally with Vilgefortz.

607
00:36:28,583 --> 00:36:32,166
To let the Continent fight their own
impossible battle. But she refused.

608
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,291
- And we won.
- But at what cost?

609
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:39,333
They held on by a thread
until you tapped into fire magic.

610
00:36:40,416 --> 00:36:43,416
Too many mages were lost
by the time you began.

611
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,125
And you lost too, didn't you?

612
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,833
Tissaia wasn't just following Vilgefortz.

613
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,791
She was fighting for the Brotherhood.

614
00:36:52,291 --> 00:36:54,333
The North, same as we're doing now.

615
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:56,541
You're fighting on a sinking ship.

616
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:01,208
The Brotherhood has no place
in the future of the Continent.

617
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:03,666
Tissaia has good intentions,

618
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:07,666
but her loyalty to this supposed home
will be her downfall.

619
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,458
And mine too.

620
00:37:10,416 --> 00:37:14,541
Tell me, why did you come tonight,
if you're so certain Aretuza is doomed?

621
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:19,250
Because you and I aren't like Tissaia.

622
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:23,583
We break rules. We aren't afraid of power.

623
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,208
There's still hope for you.

624
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,458
Traitors are already working
with Nilfgaard.

625
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:32,500
- As they always have been.
- Oh, see what you want to see.

626
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:36,041
But if Tissaia and you stick to this plan,

627
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:39,375
neither of you will be any better off
than poor Lydia.

628
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:42,958
In love with a poison
that kills you slowly.

629
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,500
Look, I hear you.

630
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:47,541
I do.

631
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:51,166
But Tissaia and I have weathered
our fair share of Brotherhood infighting.

632
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,833
We will triumph tomorrow.
Just like we did at Sodden.

633
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:59,666
And though I wish you'd have joined us
on the battlefield that day,

634
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,791
we will fight without you again.

635
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:07,875
When tomorrow's meetings unite the North,
I truly hope you can see

636
00:38:07,958 --> 00:38:10,416
that there are still
some things worth protecting.

[Philippa scoffs]

638
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,500
Thank you for coming tonight.

639
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,125
It means everything.

640
00:38:21,083 --> 00:38:23,750
Tonight means everything to us as well.

641
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,666
[Yennefer] Maybe she just wanted
to stir up drama.

642
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:31,833
Wouldn't be her first offense.

643
00:38:32,458 --> 00:38:34,750
It would explain Dijkstra's warning.

644
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,791
They clearly know something we do not.

645
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,666
But why wouldn't she speak up?

646
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,416
Nothing we accused Stregobor of
had anything to do with Nilfgaard.

647
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,041
And why the interest
in a mage who doesn't speak?

648
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,250
I don't know.

649
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:50,291
Why doesn't Lydia speak?

650
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:53,625
Her lower jaw is an illusion.
A masterful one.

651
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:58,125
She was wounded, horribly,
and now she can no longer speak aloud,

"The woman with the funny voice."

00:39:03,625 --> 00:39:05,958
- Hmm?
- Something Teryn said.

655
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,833
- Do you still have Tissaia's bracelet?
- Somewhere here.

656
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,416
I passed Lydia
on the way to the Gallery of Glory.

657
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,458
I think her earrings were made
of the same thing.

658
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,125
What were you doing up there?

659
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:23,458
[Geralt] <i>I went up
after I nearly murdered Stregobor.</i>

The First Landing.

00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:51,791
When Jan Bekker
bent the Power to his will.

670
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:57,416
He calmed the waves, proving magic
need not be evil or destructive.

671
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,583
Bekker formed what would henceforth
be known as the Brotherhood that day.

Outcasts, uniting under a common banner.

00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:10,875
An apt story.

675
00:40:12,291 --> 00:40:16,041
The only apt part is the pageant of events
I've witnessed this evening.

676
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,125
It has indeed been worthy of a painting.

It would be titled

"Geralt Leaves the Isle of Thanedd,
Shaking with Laughter."

679
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:34,083
Be that as it may, I'd hoped to find time
to speak with you this evening, Geralt.

680
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:37,541
I'd wager we have more in common
than you realize.

681

I doubt the parallels

[applause]

686
00:40:55,541 --> 00:41:00,000
Like you, I cannot define myself
as mere man, mage, or druid.

687
00:41:02,583 --> 00:41:04,000
More than anything,

688
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:05,625
I was an orphan.

689
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Left to die in a gutter in Lan Exeter.

690
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,250
I was bounced around this cruel world
by every monstrous creature imaginable.

Men, most of all.

Until I became cruel myself.

And rather than remain an unwanted mutant,

694
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:25,375
I chose to become a sorcerer.

695
00:41:26,208 --> 00:41:27,208
Out of spite.

696
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:29,625
Be careful, Vilgefortz.

697
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:33,375
Careful that the similarities
you're so desperately searching for

Oh, not to worry, witcher.
We have but one likeness that remains.

700
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:43,666
I left that headstrong young boy behind
the day I fell in love with Tissaia.

701
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:47,375
That bond,
that sense of family, changed me.

702
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:51,166
And I know the same has happened to you
with Yennefer of Vengerberg.

You seem to know a great many things.

[chuckles] Then tell me
when I reach a mistruth.

705

The longer Yennefer stays at Aretuza,
the stronger the Brotherhood will be.

706
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:09,416
The more likely we'll be able to hold off
the powers that threaten the Continent.

707
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:15,041
Have you... ever been attracted
by the art of sorcery, Geralt?

- Have you considered joining her here?

It is incredible how much
my neutrality outrages everyone.

How it subjects me
to offers of pacts and agreements

of the necessity of making a choice
