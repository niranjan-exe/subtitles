Water magic is tricky.

143
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,125
That's what you said
about earth magic, and air magic.

144
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,375
Well, you have power
like nothing I've seen.

145
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,750
Makes it hard for both of us.

That's enough for today.

Considering the mess I make
with every other kind of magic,

how could fire magic be any worse?

Remember Rience.

That look in his eye.
There's always a source.

151
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,125
With fire magic, the source is you.

152
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:22,791
It takes something you never get back.

Your magic?

00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,083
Yes.

155
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,541
But magic isn't everything.

156
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,041
You say magic isn't everything,

157
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,041
but you were willing
to trade my life for it.

158
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,791
You almost lost me to Voleth Meir.
You almost lost Geralt.

00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,916
- It was...
- I know.

160
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,083
Well, if you knew, why did you do it?

161
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,166
Because... I'd given up.

162
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,750
But I'll never make that mistake again.

00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:57,125
- [wheels rumbling]
- [horse neighing]

164
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,208
[Yarpen] Wish I had more for you,
but the Squirrels hit Henselt's convoy.

165
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,500
Look at these.
Potatoes the size of gnome nuts.

166
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:12,750
Did they attack your convoy as well?

167
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,791
[scoffs] I'd like
to see them fuckin' try it!

168
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:18,500
The elves' gripe is with the kings,
not us.

169
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:21,583
They're just trying to soften the North
for the grand cock of Nilfgaard.

170
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:25,541
Nilfgaard gave elves refuge,
and now they're fighting on their behalf.

171
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:29,541
Amazing what people will do
when you give them a second chance.

172
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:35,625
Hold on.

173
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,458
Hold on!

174
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,250
Are you two fuckin' again?

175
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,666
Subtle, Yarpen.

176
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,125
[Yarpen laughs] Who would blame you?

177
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,750
Spring's almost here.

178
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,916
Ah, the whole world's wakin' up.

179
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,541
Our Belleteyn festival is just
down the valley. You should come.

180
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,625
I'd love to.

181
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,125
- It's not safe.
- Bad idea.

182
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,083
- [Ciri] No one's asked about me in months.
- [sighs]

183
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,083
And everyone will be in costume.

184
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,541
And... I was born on Belleteyn.

185
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,416
[Yarpen] Ah! You'd have had a shot
at bein' May Queen.

186
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Except my niece's beard
is comin' in nice and full this year.

187
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,291
- [laughs]
- [Geralt hisses]

188
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,833
Just say yes, already!

189
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,166
About time for a fuckin' thaw round here.

190
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,541
[Ciri] I promise I'll be safe.

191
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,500
[sighs]

192
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,625
[growling and moaning]

193
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,333
[deep rumbling]

194
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,458
[snarling]

195
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,625
- [roaring]
- [man 1 yelps]

196
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,708
- [growling]
- [laughing]

197
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,875
Now see how you like my new pet.

198
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:58,458
- [groans]
- [man 2 laughs]

199
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,291
[loud screeching]

200
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,750
- [thumping and screeching]
- [man 2 laughing]

201
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,750
- Hmm!
- What is that thing?

202
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,708
- [laughs]
- [creature snarls]

203
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,708
I should have warned you before,
you elven mutt.

204
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:18,500
That jackapace is trained
to smell your kind from a league away.

205
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:19,583
[whooshing]

206
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,750
[Rience] Then I've come
to the right place.

207
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,041
- [jackapace screeches]
- [man 2] Show yourself.

208
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:28,041
- Or I open that and you can be its dinner.
- [footsteps approaching]

209
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:30,666
[fingers snap]

210
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,000
I need to find a girl with elven blood.

211
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:38,416
All my jacky needs is a scent.

212
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,625
Lock of hair, piece of clothin'...
[chuckles]

213
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,166
I'll do you one better.

214
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,375
[jackapace roars]

215
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,416
Put that fucking thing away.

216
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
[banging and screeching]

217
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:57,083
How much?

218
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,916
- [sheep bleats]
- [elf calls softly]

219
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,916
[distant horse neighs]

220
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,166
Gage, take your best fighters
and head west to Maribor.

221
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:17,083
Filavandrel, take yours south to Caed Dhu.

222
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,125
She is out there.

223
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,958
Have there been sightings,
or are we chasing more rumors?

224
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,208
We don't know

225
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,958
if Cirilla has Elder Blood.

226
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,791
We're basing it all
on the words of...

227
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:32,958
of some mage
who came and went just as fast.

228
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,708
You have your orders.

229
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:44,750
I want to kill them all
for what they have done to your child.

230
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:46,708
Our hope.

231
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,250
But, sister, it is not enough.

232
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,458
My aim has not wavered.

233
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:55,708
I will find Dol Blathanna.

234
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,916
But how? Where?
There is no sanctuary left for elves here.

235
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,958
All will become clear
once we have Cirilla. She is our new hope.

236
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:05,958
Do you doubt me?

237
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,041
- [elfyn] Wake up! Hurry!
- [elf] Move the carts out!

238
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,750
The others are starting to.

239
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:13,875
Gallatin and the Scoia'tael, they're back!

240
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:16,416
- It's not good.
- [elf] We need help!

241
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,708
- [sighs]
- [horses neighing]

242
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:18,666
[elf] Get the healer.

243
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,541
- [elf] I need help!
- [elfyn] Help!

244
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,041
[screaming and groaning]

245
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:29,708
He doesn't need you to play nursemaid.

246
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,500
He needs you to play soldier.

247
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:32,833
[elf coughing]

248
00:17:32,916 --> 00:17:34,958
[elfyn sobbing]

249
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:36,750
[Gallatin] Fuck.

250
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,583
[elfyn] Leave it! It's spent.

251
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,666
Needed.

252
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,375
Let me know if you plan
to start holding weapons back next,

253
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,041
leaving unarmed Squirrels
to fight for our freedom.

254
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,916
I told you. I've given you
all the fighters I can spare.

255
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,791
We both know that's bullshit.

256
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,916
Your best fighters
are running secret missions

257
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,166
to who the fuck knows where,
while the rest of us are out there,

258
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,416
following orders, attacking convoys,

259
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,666
doing the work to get our land back.

260
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,875
Doing the bidding
of yet another self-important human.

261
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,750
You think I give a shit
about that White Flame nonsense?

262
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:15,000
I give a shit about food in my stomach
and a place to call home.

263
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:19,000
I have plans, and they don't involve dying
in the woods because of your selfishness.

264
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:22,375
- Plans with Nilfgaard?
- What don't you get?

265
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:26,333
If Nilfgaard takes the North,
elves are free everywhere.

266
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:29,083
The whole Continent is our Dol Blathanna.

267
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:32,000
We tried sharing the Continent
for centuries.

268
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:37,125
If there's to be another genocide,
this time, it'll be the humans'.

269
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:45,125
You keep spouting off
about ancient times, prophecies.

270
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,500
I don't know
what you're looking for out there.

271
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,625
But you want to keep elves alive?

272
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Here we are.

273
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,333
[horse neighs]

274
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,416
[elfyn wails]

275
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,041
[music and conversation]

276
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:06,458
- [laughter]
- [Vizimir] You promised me a princess.

277
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:10,166
Now every king knows about her,
thanks to Tissaia de Vries.

278
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,625
It's not a good look, Dijkstra.
You swore Cirilla would be mine.

279
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,083
Perhaps a tad quieter, your Highness.

280
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,625
We wouldn't want your beloved
to catch wind.

281
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,916
Being the king used to mean something.

282
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,500
It's been six months.
What have you got to show for it?

283
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,250
Excuses, expenses,

284
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,166
but no sign of the new princess
you wanted me to marry.

285
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,750
Sir, our attention has been diverted
because of the Squirrels.

286
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,166
Oh, yet more excuses.

287
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,416
Don't even get me started
on those bastards.

288
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,000
Blaming us for murdering
that stupid elven baby. [scoffs]

289
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,666
That definitely wasn't us?

290
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:53,875
You have the North's largest army
and spy network.

291
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,500
We are the most feared kingdom
of the North.

292
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,500
What do I have to show for it? [scoffs]

293
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,833
A spy master who can't find one girl.

294
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:04,083
No. It's time for a change.

295
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,625
[sniffs] I've decided
to put my best person on it.

296
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,125
Someone who I can trust.

297
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,750
Radovid!

298
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,333
- What's that?
- [pop]

299
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,750
- [woman shrieks]
- [cheering]

300
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:14,833
Whoo!

301
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:18,875
Oh.

302
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:24,375
[Philippa] The king's baby brother?

303
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:29,041
Now we have to chaperone
that royal seed-waste too?

304
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,750
[Dijkstra] No, it's all for show.

305
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,291
Vizimir just needs to remind everyone
who wears the crown.

306
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,208
He wears it thanks to us.

307
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:42,000
By gods, we've been doing this
too long, Dijkstra.

308
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,333
[chuckles] There's no such thing.

309
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,750
Our alliance, however old,

310
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:48,916
keeps us young.

311
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,958
Now, as for Prince Seed-waste,

312
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,250
boulder, parchment, dagger.

313
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,458
Absolutely not.

314
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:01,875
I was the one who seduced
the Lyrian baroness last month,

315
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,500
and the only secret she was hiding
was syphilis.

316
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:08,416
And that's worse than the week I spent
perched over a shit-filled moat in Temeria

317
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,375
while they debated timber prices?

318
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,458
Fair.

319
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,208
Perhaps I can order someone to babysit
the prince while he looks for the girl.

320
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,708
Mmm. We don't trust anyone else.

321
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,833
Hmm.

322
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,291
<i>If </i>I do this...

323
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,375
I'll be the only one giving orders
when I get back.

324
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:55,750
[Ciri] I've never been to a Belleteyn
festival outside of Cintra before.

325
00:21:56,541 --> 00:22:00,916
You know, this one year, Sir Lazlo tried
to jump the bonfire in full armor.

326
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:05,541
What do you think?

327
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:11,083
[sighs] I think you need to hide your hair
and mask your eyes.

328
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,916
Would it kill you to say,
"You look lovely"?

329
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,208
Ciri.

330
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,000
I knew this was a bad idea.

331
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,708
You look lovely.

332
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,625

[crowd] Whoa!

336
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:11,833
- Stay close.
- Should we, uh, find the ale tent?

337
00:23:14,875 --> 00:23:16,041
Read my mind.

338
00:23:17,041 --> 00:23:18,958
[Ciri] Cods, I've missed this.

339
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,041
- I'm going dancing.
- [Yennefer] Be safe.

340
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,875
[lively folk music]

[laughter]

342
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:30,166
[Yennefer] Look at what happens
when we let her have one good night.

343
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,375
Let's not pretend your motivations
aren't entirely unselfish, Yennefer.

344
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,208
[man] Play "Old Times"!

345
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,166
Happy birthday to you too.

346
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,833
You remembered.

347
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,416
I don't forget much.

348
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,791
So you remember our good nights.

349
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:53,125
After the djinn.

350
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:58,291
The library in Kovir.

351
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,416
[laughs]

352
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:02,333
So much for staying quiet.

353
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:05,875
The farmhouse.

354
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,750
In Murivel.

355
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,666
The overnight carriage ride
from Ellander to Moën.

356
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:15,916
And the ride back.

357
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,375
Don't forget the ride back.

358
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,125
[Yennefer] How could I? That would be like
forgetting our night in Caingorn.

359
00:24:23,208 --> 00:24:24,208
Ah!

360
00:24:24,958 --> 00:24:26,250
That dragon hunt.

361
00:24:28,916 --> 00:24:30,583
Those nights were amazing.

362
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,541
- But the mornings...
- They were lonely.

363
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,250
You often left before dawn.

364
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:39,041
Or you did.

365
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:44,708
I know why I left, but why did you?

366
00:24:47,375 --> 00:24:49,541
Scared of what would happen
if we really tried?

367
00:24:57,166 --> 00:24:59,583
I was unsure
if it was actually what I wanted.

368
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,708
Not just some trick of the djinn's magic.

369
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:07,708
And now?

370
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:11,333
[Ciri] Let's go in the maze!

371
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:13,875
Come on!

372
00:25:21,625 --> 00:25:22,625
Come on!

Ciri.

385
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:34,666
[Geralt] Ciri!

386
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:36,833
[Yennefer] Ciri!

[jackapace screeches]

- [grunts]
- [Ciri] Geralt!

[squelching]

402
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,583
- We'll find another home.
- I liked this one.

403
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,458
We all did.

404
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:23,083
- How did that thing find us?
- [Geralt] A jackapace hunts by scent.

405
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:26,750
- It found Ciri because it knew her.
- Her scent? How?

406
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:29,833
Vesemir told me that Rience
stole Ciri's blood from Kaer Morhen.

407
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,833
He must have used the blood
as a scent marker.

408
00:28:32,916 --> 00:28:34,875
[Yennefer] So wherever we go,
he'll find us?

409
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:37,458
[Geralt] Yes. Unless we find him first.

410
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:38,583
We draw him out.

411
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:43,125
We give him the thing he wants most.

412
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:45,916
Me.

413
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:52,083
[Yarpen] Look, I'm sorry. I wouldn't have
invited you if I knew it weren't safe.

414
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:55,625
We know. But now you can make it up to us.

415
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:57,791
You have a caravan leaving tomorrow,
don't you?

416
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:00,166
- Aye. To Hagge.
- I want to go with you.

417
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,125
- By yourself?
- [Yennefer] Not quite.

418
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,541
We'll be there too.

419
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:06,458
[Ciri] But it's important
no one knows that.

420
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:09,458
- Or else this plan isn't going to work.
- [chuckles]

421
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:12,750
Count me in. Tell me what I need to do.

422
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:16,708
[Geralt] There's only one monster handler
reckless enough to cage a jackapace.

423
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,125
- [yells]
- [Geralt] <i>Name's Veldhoek.</i>

00:29:19,208 --> 00:29:21,875
- Oh...
- [Geralt] <i>Nasty fellow with a nasty habit.</i>

00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:24,625
[Ciri] <i>Rience hired Veldhoek to find me.</i>

<i>Now they'll want
to hear about your convoy.</i>

[yells]

[Yennefer] <i>We need you to complain
about the spoilt brat</i>

429
00:29:30,916 --> 00:29:32,458
<i>who ruined Belleteyn for everyone.</i>

430
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:36,041
And what's worse, now I have to haul
that ivy-eyed brat's pale arse

431
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:38,166
all the way to Aedirn with my caravan.

432
00:29:38,666 --> 00:29:42,083
Gonna charge them double if I have to
put up with any of her yappery.

433
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:46,875
Come on, you elven mutt.

434
00:29:49,291 --> 00:29:51,083
[Ciri] <i>They'll know
who you're talking about.</i>

[creature growling]

436
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,500
[Ciri] <i>And how much
that information is worth.</i>

437
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,041
- [Rience] Enjoy your reward.
- [Yarpen] <i>Hold up, buttercup.</i>

438
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:01,875
You think this mage is gonna believe
you'd let Ciri ride without an escort?

439
00:30:01,958 --> 00:30:04,250
She'll be traveling with someone we trust.

440
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,458
Someone<i>...</i>

441
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,541
seemingly innocuous.

442
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,166
Oh, come on! No...

443
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:12,458
- [woman grunts]
- [yelps] It was one time!

444
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:15,083
Admittedly, with many different people.

445
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,708
And it meant nothing!

446
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:19,708
I mean, these aren't even mine!

447
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:23,208
Did you think you were the only one
having some fun on the side,

448
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:26,000
you lying, wretched son of the devil?

449
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:27,750
Well...

450
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:30,375
yeah, kinda! [yelps]

451
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:34,916
This is what we do, my sweet.
We are creatives.

452
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,916
Freethinkers.

453
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,958
- All is fair!
- Is it, though?

454
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,166
Ah! Oh!

455
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,375
Ooh! When will magic, sexy women
just stop jumping out at me?

456
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,333
Usually it's you coming at me from above.

457
00:30:47,416 --> 00:30:49,583
- She doesn't have a crossbow, does she?
- No!

458
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,208
Possibly. Yeah, no,
I wouldn't rule it out.

459
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,500
No crossbows!

460
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,500
And you can fuckin' have him!

461
00:30:56,583 --> 00:30:58,208
And his pox-marked cock!

462
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:00,250
Now who's lying, Vespula?

463
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:02,958
We've lost patience, Sandpiper.

464
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:07,333
- I... I'm doing everything that I can. I...
- You're doing nothing.

465
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:09,250
Except fucking people over.

466
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:13,000
We invested a lot in your operations.

467
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:15,958
- And we've gotten nothing in return.
- [whimpers]

468
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,125
Dijkstra and I are ready to cut you loose.

469
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,833
- But King Vizimir is more forgiving.
- [winces]

470
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,791
He's ready to welcome the girl
with open arms. Shall we?

471
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:29,458
Yeah, and an open pair of pantaloons.

472
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:30,791
Yeah... Uh, no, darling...

473
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:32,291
No! Look at me.

474
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:35,833
Look at my eyes.
There is no need to harm the innocent!

475
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:36,958
No, no, no, don't!

476
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:38,041
No...

477
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:44,500
I thought I left you cradling
a pint of ale some distance away.

478
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,458
- You did. I got bored.
- Hmm. Oh.

479
00:31:49,666 --> 00:31:53,625
How fortunate that is.
I've long wanted to see you in person.

480
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,708
"Song of the Seven" is my favorite.

481
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:59,833
Yeah. That's... slightly ironic,
but thank you.

482
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:01,666
You see? People like me.

483
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,791
I've got fans.
Sorry, I didn't quite catch your name.

484
00:32:04,875 --> 00:32:06,083
- Uh, Radovid.
- Right.

485
00:32:06,166 --> 00:32:07,166
Comma, Prince.

486
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:10,208
Comma, wow. Whoa... wow. You're...

487
00:32:10,291 --> 00:32:13,541
Ooh! The Prince of Redania.

488
00:32:13,625 --> 00:32:16,208
Fuck, I don't really know
what I'm supposed to... Bow?

489
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:19,375
Or curtsy, or... Been holding your hand
a very long time. I'm so sorry.

490
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:23,000
Listen, I wish I could help you, truly.
But...

491
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:25,916
- But nothing, Sandpiper...
- If I may offer a thought.

492
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:29,750
Ah, this poor Cirilla girl
has enemies everywhere,

493
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:33,083
and, truth be told,
Redania's not a bad place.

494
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:36,208
Bit cold in the winter
and humid in the summer,

495
00:32:36,291 --> 00:32:38,500
but the food is spectacular.

496
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:40,708
And my brother's not bad.

497
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:42,500
As monarchs go.

498
00:32:44,916 --> 00:32:48,291
Redania may not be perfect,
but it's her least bad option.

499
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,291
- You could be our royal bard.
- [laughs]

500
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:53,375
Uh... Ha, ha!

501
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:57,333
No. No, a staid life at court
is not for me.

502
00:32:57,416 --> 00:33:00,541
If your time at court's been staid,
you've been doing it wrong.

503
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,791
Either deliver the girl,

504
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:09,750
or we will single-handedly undo

505
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:12,583
every good deed
you have done for the elves.

506
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,750
We will kill them all.

507
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,541
- Yeah, yeah, I got the gist.
- Mmm.

508
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:21,500
I've got business in town
before we portal back to Tretogor.

509
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:24,166
- You... have five days.
- [gulps]

510
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,541
- [Yarpen] Oi, you lute-playin' walloper!
- [sighs]

511
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:38,000
Again with this fresh hell...

512
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,166
Mr. Zigrin! [chuckles]

513
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,375
- Julian Alfred Pankratz.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

514
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:47,125
I fucking know!

515
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,625
I know you know. It's a rule of threes
thing. Has to be done.

516
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,208
What can I do for you, Yarpen?

517
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:54,125
I've got ears and good taste, so... nothin'.

518
00:33:55,291 --> 00:33:57,958
But... your friends need help.

519
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,500
[sighs] Of course they do.

520
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:07,208
- [horses neighing]
- [Jaskier] Bait!

521
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,708
I rode for days to get here,

522
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,791
battling hunger, battling the elements,

523
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:15,291
only to discover upon my arrival
that I'm being used as...

524
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,375
- Jaskier, me.
- ...bait.

525
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:18,750
I am the bait. Rience is after me.

526
00:34:18,833 --> 00:34:22,791
Yes, which means he wants you alive,
and me very much not alive.

527
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,000
You see my anxiety?

528
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:26,666
We're not gonna let
anything happen to you.

529
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,416
I saved your arse once.
I can do it again, Pankratz.

530
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:31,666
You didn't save me...

531
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,375
- She didn't save me. She...
- [horse snorting]

532
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:35,500
She didn't!

533
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,583
But seriously,
you are gonna save me, right?

534
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:41,250
We won't make Hagge by sunset.

535
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,083
We should make camp here.

536
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,041
[dwarves shouting]

537
00:34:48,541 --> 00:34:50,541
[epic music]

538
00:35:09,125 --> 00:35:10,458
[Ciri] What is this place?

539
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:12,416
[Geralt] It's Shaerrawedd.

540
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:16,000
[Yennefer] Tread lightly.
This land is full of stories.

541
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:20,083
Never seen
so many wild roses in one place.

542
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:22,333
They're beautiful.

543
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,250
Their story, sadly, is not.

544
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:28,750
Aelirenn.

545
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:33,625
A brave and inspiring elven warrior
who thought she could defeat the humans.

546
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,625
She was wrong.

547
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:39,958
A rather condensed version of the story.

548
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,541
[Ciri] And what's yours, then?

549
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:47,458
After the Conjunction, humans arrived.

550
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,041
The elves thought
the humans were just a nuisance,

551
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:54,750
like a plague of locusts or a drought.

552
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,875
That they would die off
in the blink of an elven eye.

553
00:35:58,791 --> 00:36:00,833
But the humans kept multiplying.

554
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,041
And killing.

555
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:08,041
Aelirenn knew
the threat wasn't going away.

556
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:12,916
So she rallied all of the young elves
to fight, at Shaerrawedd.

557
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:18,416
Sounds like she fought
for what she believed in.

558
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,500
To protect her people.

559
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,625
[Geralt] She did fight
for what she believed in.

560
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,916
She led those young
and passionate elves to war.

561
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,916
They revered this place.

562
00:36:32,458 --> 00:36:34,125
This is where they fought.

563
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,333
They fought for her.

564
00:36:36,833 --> 00:36:40,791
And they died with her name on their lips
and their honor and integrity intact.

565
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:46,500
And in doing so, they condemned
their species to annihilation.

566
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,375
She led them all to their deaths.

567
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:55,875
Neutrality. [sighs]

568
00:36:55,958 --> 00:36:57,583
It won't get you a statue.

569
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:01,125
But it'll certainly help
in keeping you alive.

570
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:13,083
- [elf 1] And fight!
- [elf 2] Weak humans!

571
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:16,500
- [elfyn] Ahh! That'll teach them!
- [elf 2] Yeah!

572
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:19,708
[Gallatin] When will the humans learn
to travel with more guards?

573
00:37:19,791 --> 00:37:21,833
- [elf 3] How many men did you kill?
- Eat.

574
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:23,708
- [elf 3] Here they are.
- Here.

575
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:26,125
Got to fatten you up.
Need you back out there.

576
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,000
- [elf 4] Well done, brother.
- Here.

577
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:30,583
Eat.

578
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:37,000
- Food goes to the ones who fought.
- We fight just like you.

579
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:38,500
Then eat what you captured.

580
00:37:38,583 --> 00:37:41,041
All elves share equally.

581
00:37:41,666 --> 00:37:43,791
Otherwise,
we're no better than the humans.

582
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:54,500
All elves must risk equally, as well.

583
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,041
You were right.

584
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:01,083
Our Scoia'tael forces should be united.

585
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:02,875
In purpose,

586
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
but also in action.

587
00:38:05,291 --> 00:38:07,166
Must've been an eventful morning.

588
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,750
What did you see out there
to change your mind?

589
00:38:09,833 --> 00:38:13,750
[Francesca] Nothing. I simply had time
to consider your position.

590
00:38:15,041 --> 00:38:17,916
We have different ideas
of what Dol Blathanna looks like.

591
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:19,916
But we both want a home.

592
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:22,500
And we can find it faster together.

593
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:33,583
You should get out of that tent
more often.

594
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:34,708
Hmm.

595
00:38:36,208 --> 00:38:38,500
Tomorrow, we make our next move.

596
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:42,375
I'll be by your side. As long as it takes.

597
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,958
[birdsong]

598
00:38:58,416 --> 00:38:59,875
[sighs softly]

599
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:08,000
- Ciri!
- Ciri.

600
00:39:08,083 --> 00:39:10,500
You two really think
I'm that shitty of a guard?

601
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,291
I had another dream.

602
00:39:18,416 --> 00:39:19,541
[Geralt] A nightmare?

603
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:22,541
No, it wasn't frightening.

604
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:25,583
Just couldn't sleep
thinking about Aelirenn.

605
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:27,208
And my grandmother.

606
00:39:28,041 --> 00:39:29,583
They lived centuries apart,

607
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,666
but burned with the exact same mission.

608
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:36,750
Wipe the other species off the Continent.

609
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,541
[sighs]

610
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,791
When I finally fell asleep,

611
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
it came to me.

612
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:55,708
If I can offer something different...

613
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:01,375
A way forward that doesn't divide,
but unites.

614
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:04,875
I'm part elf, I'm part human.

615
00:40:04,958 --> 00:40:08,750
I understand both because I am both,
and that is my strength.

616
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,333
I understand what you're saying.

617
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,750
History, it... [sighs]

618
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:17,708
...has a way of repeating itself.

619
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,125
Even for the idealistic.

620
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:24,000
You say Aelirenn's idealism is what led
to the massacre of the young elves,

621
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:28,375
but maybe if her elders had supported her
instead of abandoning her,

622
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:29,458
they could've won.

623
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:34,250
Yen, you overheard something
when you were taken prisoner by the elves.

624
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,125
You told me they had a saying.

625
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,541
[speaking in Elder]

626
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:44,250
What has been need not always be.

627
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,625
Francesca, the elven queen,

628
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:51,000
she believed she could offer
something more to her people.

629
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,708
And so do I.

630
00:40:54,625 --> 00:40:58,458
Geralt, you taught me how to fight.
Just like Calanthe.

631
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:02,250
And Yen, you're teaching me how
to harness my powers. Like Mousesack.

632
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:06,291
What if this is the reason
destiny brought us together?

633
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:11,625
Nenneke said I have the power
to change the cycle of hatred.

634
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:14,000
And I want to.

635
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:19,333
To be the balance between kings and mages,
and to align the Continent,

636
00:41:19,416 --> 00:41:22,333
instead of constantly pitting parts
against each other.

637
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:27,041
Because I am sick and tired
of destruction and loss.

638
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,833
I don't doubt you, Ciri.

639
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,458
I do doubt the world, though.

640
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,916
- It...
- [low rumbling]

641
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,041
Let's go. Now.

642
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,666
[Yennefer] We'll be right here.

643
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Are you ready?

644
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:13,833
- [Yennefer] How long do we wait?
- [Geralt] Until she draws them out.

645
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,333
- [sighs shakily]
- She can do this.

646
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,541
[thudding steps]

647
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:29,416
[Rience] Cirilla of Cintra.

648
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,500
Alone at last.

649
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:36,916
Well, not quite.
I've brought more friends this time.

650
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,166
[yells]

651
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:56,708
Last time, I beat you with my wits.
This time, you meet my magic.

652
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:14,392
- [man 1] With me!
- [man 2] Get in there, lads!

653
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:15,625
I like my odds.

654
00:43:16,166 --> 00:43:17,666
[Yarpen] I like our odds better!

655
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,666
[dwarves yelling]

656
00:43:22,291 --> 00:43:23,625
This is too easy!

657
00:43:29,583 --> 00:43:30,958
- [Yennefer] Geralt!
- [grunts]

658
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,041
[Rience] Fuck!

659
00:43:33,208 --> 00:43:34,458
Go!

660
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,416
[Ciri] Can you keep it open?

661
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,166
Some new strain of Chaotic insanity.

662
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:01,166
But I will.
We just need to wait for Geralt.

663
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:04,291
[Yarpen] Archers! Get down!

664
00:44:14,041 --> 00:44:16,875
- Where the fuck is the caravan?
- She's all that matters.

665
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:26,708
- You have your orders. Go.
- What?

666
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:28,291
Shit!

667
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:38,708
[Ciri] Keep it open.

668
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:40,231
- [elf 1] Follow me!
- [elf 2] Right!

669
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:45,416
[yelling]

[screaming]

671
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,291
You don't look so special.

672
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,250
[dwarf 1] Motherfucker!

673
00:44:58,125 --> 00:44:59,625
You bastard!

674
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:03,916
- [Yarpen] Move!
- [Jaskier] Come on.

675
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,833
Come on, I got you. I got you.

676
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,791
You call yourself an elf.

677
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:14,125
She's <i>Hen Ichaer</i>.

678
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:15,833
- And she belongs with...
- Me!

679
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:17,708
- [roaring sound]
- [Francesca yells]

680
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:21,500
[Filavandrel] We need to
get her out of here!

681
00:45:21,583 --> 00:45:22,791
Come on, Geralt.

682
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,375
[voices whispering in Elder]

683
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:30,375
[Rience] Your mage is out of her depth.

[yelling and screaming]

[Yennefer grunts] The elves came for Ciri.

00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:00,000
[Yarpen] This way!

688
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:02,500
[elf 1] Move!

689
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:34,583
[elf 2] Come on. She could be in here!

690
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,750
[elf 3] You two, with me!

691
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:43,791
[Yarpen] You're gonna fuckin' die,
Squirrels!

692
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:45,666
Go. Fall back.

693
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,583
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

694
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,333
- Fall back! Quick!
- Follow me!

695
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:51,375
Come on, come on. Wake up.
Come on, get up.

696
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:57,208
Oh!

697
00:46:57,291 --> 00:46:58,291
Oh, ho-ho!

698
00:47:00,875 --> 00:47:02,500
I've got her! I've got her!

699
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,583
[Francesca] No! No!

700
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:07,750
[screams] No!

701
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:09,166
We have to go.

702
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,791
- [elf] Fall back!
- [Ciri] Careful.

[Jaskier moans]

704
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:16,250
Oh, if I die, promise me
Valdo Marx will not play at my funeral.

705
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:18,083
[Geralt] You'll be fine.

706
00:47:19,125 --> 00:47:20,875
Your lute, on the other hand,

707
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:22,875
has seen better days.

708
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:24,958
[Yarpen] You helped my men.

709
00:47:25,541 --> 00:47:27,583
- [strings resonate]
- You have my thanks.

710
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,625
Jaskier.

711
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:33,708
- You're the bravest bait that ever lived.
- [chuckles] Whew!

712
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:36,666
- [dwarf laughs] You owe me one!
- [Jaskier groans]

713
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,500
Promise me we will never do that again.

714
00:47:40,583 --> 00:47:43,083
- [breathing heavily]
- Thank you, Jaskier.

00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:45,166
[mournful music]

716
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:54,416
[Geralt] You said the portal was different
from anything you've experienced.

717
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:58,500
- What did you mean?
- [Yennefer] It was dark.

718
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:00,666
It took me over.

719
00:48:02,875 --> 00:48:04,708
I can still feel its residue.

720
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:08,250
Rience isn't the only rogue mage
we're dealing with.

721
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,041
Someone very powerful is puppeting him.

722
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:14,208
You need to make more progress
with Ciri's training.

723
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:15,916
- Mmm...
- I'll work harder.

724
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,166
It's not about what you can do.

725
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:21,208
It's about what I can do. I need help.

726
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:23,750
- If I can talk to Tissaia...
- No.

727
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:29,541
You don't know how difficult it is
to embody power but not have access to it.

728
00:48:29,625 --> 00:48:31,750
Going to Aretuza
cannot be the only answer.

729
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:33,625
It's the best thing for her.

730
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:34,708
Is it?

731
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:38,583
Come with us, then.

732
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,458
Stay and make sure she's safe.

733
00:48:41,875 --> 00:48:43,291
[Ciri] All I want

734
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:46,416
is for us to stay together.

735
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,583
[Yennefer] I can make this work.

736
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:55,916
If you can find a way to trust me.

737
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:05,791
I need to find Rience to finish him off.

738
00:49:08,208 --> 00:49:09,666
I can't go with you.

739
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,166
And we can't go with you.

740
00:49:16,833 --> 00:49:18,583
Then we have to split up.
