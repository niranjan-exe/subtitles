1
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,875
[wind gusting]

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,916
[Geralt] Ciri!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,708
[panting]

4
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,416
[echoing snatches of voices]

5
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,416
[Ciri] <i>I'm not afraid of him anymore.</i>

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,500
[screaming]

7
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:35,416
[Gallatin] <i>The only human
who's gained my loyalty so far is you.</i>

8
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,666
[echoing whisper]

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,666
[Ciri] <i>You'll pay for this.</i>

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,416
[distorted] <i>Nilfgaardian scum.</i>

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,833
Oh...

12
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:47,083
I've known you since your voice cracked.
Never seen you sleep past dawn.

13
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,500
[Cahir] My lord.

14
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,583
I wanted to welcome you back myself.

15
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,041
[groans]

16
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,875
[soldiers drilling outside]

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,083
I have a mission for you.

18
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:00,416
I... I, um...

19
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,208
I didn't expect an assignment so soon.

20
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:09,333
No? Well, you did what I asked you to do
without hesitation, and then...

21
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:10,666
[Cahir sighs]

22
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,875
Then you cleaned up your mess.

23
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,000
That is all the proof I need
to know that you are ready.

24
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:22,666
All necessary supplies are
at your disposal. Weapons, transport, men...

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,541
[sighs]

26
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,166
But we must move quickly.

27
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,916
[sighs]

28
00:01:39,958 --> 00:01:41,291
[sighs]

29
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
This...

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This is ambitious.

31
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,791
Francesca will not be an easy target.

32
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,833
Perhaps we should enlist Frin...

33
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,333
[Emhyr] Fringilla?

34
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:01,625
What became of her?

35
00:02:02,375 --> 00:02:03,375
Hmm?

36
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:05,041
She is dead.

37
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,666
[sighs] And you are here.

38
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:20,041
[sighs] You said you knew a good leader
when you saw them.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
How?

40
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,833
How do you know
you're doing the right thing?

41
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:36,416
When you have finished this mission,
we shall have everything that we want.

42
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,625
We'll be able to knock the North over
with a feather,

43
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:44,208
and I'll have my daughter by my side,
where she belongs.

44
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,666
Let go of the questions.

45
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,916
Embrace what we have done together.

46
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,666
[sighs]

47
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,041
You leave today.

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,291
- [door opens]
- [sighs]

49
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,375
[sighs shakily]

50
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:17,750
[Yennefer] My plan is to open
with a traditional ball.

51
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:21,083
- Is it me, or is she like a bad fungus?
- [Yennefer] Then spend the next two days

52
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,166
strategizing a Northern alliance
against Nilfgaard.

53
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,083
An alliance led by a traitor will only
serve to fan the flames of division.

54
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,500
- Aye.
- Aye.

55
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:31,875
Let her speak.

56
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,166
She says she's here to help.
I believe her.

57
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,291
We must set our differences aside

58
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:42,583
to create a stronghold
between Verden, Kaedwen,

59
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,786
- Temeria, Aedirn, Lyria...
- [chuckling] Oh, come on!

60
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,708
And Redania!

61
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:49,958
Redania acts in their own interest
with complete disregard for anyone else.

62
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,708
A posture Yennefer understands intimately!

63
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,041
Redania has
the most powerful army in the North.

64
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,250
Foltest's soldiers, Henselt's,

65
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,625
their combined forces are still shy
of what Vizimir could provide us.

66
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,708
We believe Philippa Eilhart
can deliver her king.

67
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,666
- "We"?
- [Vilgefortz] And who is "we"?

68
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,958
Yennefer has <i>my </i>full support.

69
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,833
- [murmuring]
- Of course she has <i>your </i>support!

70
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,375
[Yennefer] If I may...

71
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:18,916
I would like to thank all of you.

72
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,166
Not only for your cooperation now...

73
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:26,458
but for your forgiveness of the past.

74
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:33,333
This conclave is my first step
on the path of regaining your trust.

75
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,958
If we are to unite the Continent,

76
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:39,541
and let me be clear, we have to,

77
00:04:40,125 --> 00:04:41,458
we must first agree.

78
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,375
No more division.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
No more secrets.

80
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,000
We can all be our best selves.

81
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,875
For the Brotherhood.

82
00:04:57,791 --> 00:04:59,500
[wistful music]

83
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,875
Like a fungus.

84
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:39,416
I felt his hand grab my shoulder.

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,958
[birdsong]

86
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,625
Specters aren't supposed
to do that, right?

87
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,166
[sighs]

88
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,750
There's a theory that the monoliths
are conduits to other spheres,

89
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,583
and your power is the key
to opening those conduits.

90
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:01,375
In Kaer Morhen, you portaled us
to the same sphere the Wild Hunt inhabit.

91
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,416
And left the door open on my way out.

92
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,291
Mm-hmm.

93
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:06,791
[sighs] Great.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,041
- So now we have to go Aretuza?
- Mm-hmm.

95
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:15,333
I thought you said it wasn't safe
because of what you saw in the castle.

96
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,333
It's the best option for all of us.

97
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,250
[sighs heavily]

98
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:23,833
Fine.

99
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,000
What happened?

100
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,666
Why don't you wanna go there?

101
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:36,958
[sighs] Because it's filled
with catty women who...

102
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,958
who gossip, and get sloppy drunk, and...

103
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,833
[sighs]

104
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,875
And I said some things to Yennefer
that I regret.

105
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,541
She'll forgive you.

106
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,875
[horses nickering]

107
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,666
What if I'm just not good enough?

108
00:06:58,708 --> 00:06:59,625
[Geralt scoffs]

109
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,041
- Your power is beyond measure.
- [Ciri chuckles]

110
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,250
- It's your job to say that.
- Ciri.

111
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,291
This isn't my area of expertise.

112
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,041
Perhaps you're struggling
because you're scared of your abilities?

113
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,666
Maybe,

114
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,916
if you truly embrace
who you are and your power...

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,083
[sighs]

116
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,500
...you'll be able to access it
whenever you wish.

117
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:24,708
[Ciri] Hmm.

118
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,916
[Geralt] And close all doors behind you.

119
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
[optimistic music]

120
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,708
[Yennefer] Invitations are going out
across the Continent.

121
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,625
We expect responses within the day.

122
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:48,125
[Tissaia] You know, for someone
who disdains politics, you do excel at it.

123
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,250
It's just personal agenda
wrapped up in a different package.

124
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,333
If this is what it takes
to keep us all safe, it's worth it.

125
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:57,000
The Council already agreed
to the conclave.

126
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,791
You can drop the groveling now.

127
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:02,083
- [sighs]
- [both laugh]

128
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:07,375
- This is new.
- Mmm. It's a gift from Vilgefortz.

129
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,208
He says it's for protection.
I say it's for love.

130
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,625
[both chuckle]

131
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,500
I can feel it.

132
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:18,208
Somewhere, Philippa is rolling her eyes.

133
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:23,333
You know, I never understood what happened
with you two. You were so close.

134
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,208
There's nothing to understand.

135
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,958
The friendship just ran its course.

136
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:33,458
Then I think I'll deliver
my invitation to her in person.

137
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,791
Groveling is the sincerest form
of manipulation.

138
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:37,875
[Triss] Tissaia.

139
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,250
Another novice has gone.

140
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,375
Elizabet. Her room is empty.

141
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,458
[Tissaia] All the rooms are empty.

142
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,083
I told the novices to relocate to Loxia
for the conclave. I'm sure she is fine.

143
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:52,708
But there was blood. What if she's hurt?

144
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:55,416
Well, then,
we need to get less clumsy novices.

145
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,791
Um, Yennefer, I hope
your ward can carry herself.

146
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,958
Geralt is bringing Ciri.

147
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:08,708
He told me everything
that happened at Kaer Morhen.

148
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:13,666
Thank you.

149
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,916
She's the reason I'm doing all of this.

150
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:32,500
- [laughs]
- Hey!

151
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,916
- Hi.
- [chuckling] Hey.

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Uh...

153
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,625
- I haven't seen you since, uh...
- Since...

154
00:09:39,791 --> 00:09:41,000
- Too long.
- Yeah.

155
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:41,916
[both chuckle]

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,625
You here for the conclave?

157
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,625
Uh, officially, yes.

158
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,833
Unofficially, you're here
for the great reading material.

159
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:55,208
Oh, so are your clandestine library
excursions far more exciting than this?

160
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,541
Exciting isn't the word.

161
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,250
[sighs] I've been tracking the novices
who've gone missing this year.

162
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:07,375
Yeah, three or four in my year got scared
they couldn't hack it.

163
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:12,000
I know these girls.
This feels like something else.

164
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,583
All of them are half elven.
This can't be a coincidence.

165
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,208
[Istredd] What are you thinking?

166
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:26,250
- I think they've been taken by force.
- Something's been bothering me.

167
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:31,041
I traveled with the Scoia'tael
for a while, trying to help the elves.

168
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,916
Instead, I watched them instigate the same
cycle of violence that victimized them.

169
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:40,375
Now, the book I'm looking for,
the <i>Book of Monoliths</i>,

170
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,291
it holds the key
to traveling between spheres.

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,416
I thought if I had it,
I could break that cycle,

172
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,916
offer the elves safety
away from the Continent.

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,250
But someone at Aretuza beat me to it.

174
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,666
What if the person
who's kidnapping those girls

175
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,625
is planning to use the book
to banish them

176
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,958
for good?

177
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:01,416
[unsettling music]

178
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,666
- [man] Got some more boxes...
- [Ciri] Chain ferries are slow.

179
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:09,458
[Geralt] Riding back to Gors Velen
would take longer.

180
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,666
Besides, the passage has
already been arranged.

181
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,208
[man] Gonna take my head off!

182
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,875
[optimistic music]

183
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,750
Well, if it isn't my favorite
pocket-sized princess. How are you?

184
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,125
- [Ciri chuckles]
- How are the lessons going?

185
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,916
Tread lightly around the magic lessons.

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,166
He's not actually talking
about my lessons.

187
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,541
He's talking about
your lessons in smiling.

188
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,976
- Work in progress.
- [Jaskier] Yeah.

189
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,083
[chuckles]

190
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,166
- Why are you not on board yet?
- The ferryman won't cross.

191
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,208
He's convinced
there's a monster in the water.

192
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,083
[whimsical music]

193
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,583
Can we go around the gulf?

194
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:53,208
- [Jaskier] Adds two days to our journey.
- Besides, we're witchers.

195
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,125
Is that so?

196
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:02,458
Judging by the time of year and the depth
of water in this part of the North Sea,

197
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:04,916
I doubt it's anything <i>that </i>dangerous.

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,416
- Maybe a kelpie...
- Ciri...

199
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
[chuckles]

200
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:11,041
We've been focusing so much on my magic.
What about my hunting skills?

201
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,250
My ability to protect myself.

202
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,833
I wouldn't want that to rust. Would you?

203
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:26,166
[Geralt] If we kill your monster,

204
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,750
will you accept that
as payment for the passage?

205
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,291
Ah... You've got yourself a deal.

206
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,000
[Jaskier] Yes!

207
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,833
Lessons paying off!

208
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,125
Kinda.

209
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,791
[groans]

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,250
[ferryman] Glad I came upon you, witcher.

211
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,666
That beast's been a right pain in my arse.

212
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:51,458
Put me out of commission.

213
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,958
Between that
and the Wild Hunt ridin' again... [scoffs]

214
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,750
You're far too old
to believe in fairy tales, Obin.

215
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,666
You sound like my wife.

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,333
I saw it with my own eyes.

217
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:07,708
Right up in the sky
above that tower on Thanedd.

218
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,666
Came down on the ground. They were here.

219
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,625
Real. Powerful.

220
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:17,250
What do they want here?
What do you think it means?

221
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:21,375
The Wild Hunt is an omen for war, missy.

222
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,500
No one's ever seen them ride amongst us.

223
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:25,916
This is different.

224
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,958
Humans against halflings.
Dwarves against elves.

225
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,416
A full-on bloody massacre. No survivors.

226
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:43,333
But perhaps best to leave fortune telling
to the soothsayers, hmm?

227
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:44,625
[man] No more on the ship!

228
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:46,833
- [man humming]
- Looks like a peaceful day to me.

229
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,458
[humming grows louder]

230
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, you are fucking kidding me.

231
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,416
- [troupe humming]
- Who is that, Jaskier?

232
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,833
[troupe harmonizing]

233
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,958
Wow. That was...

234
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,333
nice.

235
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,684
- Good to see you again, Valdo Marx.
- Well, hello, Johan.

236
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:11,708
Jaskier.

237
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,208
- Lovely to see you.
- Good.

238
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:15,958
[Obin] Mr. Marx, a pleasure to meet you!

239
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,125
Me... me and the wife are big fans!

240
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,375
- Oh, the pleasure is all mine, good sir.
- Ah!

241
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:24,166
My troupe is in a bit of a rush.
How much for us all to cross?

242
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,791
For you... oh! Half price!

243
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,791
Half fucking pri... Are you kidding me?

244
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:29,750
Ooh... ooh...

245
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,291
[laughing]

246
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,625
Aaah!

247
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,416
The day just got better.

248
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Oi.

249
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,041
[Valdo] That G was sharp.

250
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,500
- [man] Sorry.
- [chuckles]

251
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,041
[Vilgefortz] We appreciate
the urgency of the conclave,

252
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,000
and the stakes for everyone involved.

253
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:51,666
The Council will create a secure portal
to get you safely to Redania and back.

254
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,000
If the rogue mage is somehow tracking you,
you'll be well camouflaged.

255
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:01,000
What makes you so sure they're a "he"?
Women can be arseholes too.

256
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,625
What is your agenda here, Yennefer?

257
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,625
Aside from helping
your crumbling organization

258
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:15,500
regain some semblance of control
before Nilfgaard destroys the Continent?

259
00:15:15,583 --> 00:15:16,791
[laughter in courtyard]

260
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:19,416
Tissaia will always protect you.

261
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,625
But every time you leave a mess behind,
she's the one who cleans it up.

262
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:26,875
I won't let her get hurt again.

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,583
So if you have some hidden cause,

264
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,333
if you're here to use her
and abandon her again,

265
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:36,708
tell me now.

266
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:43,708
I've hidden nothing.

267
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,541
[snorts softly]

268
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,916
I couldn't if I tried.

269
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,458
She knows me at my core.

270
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,541
[poignant music]

271
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,583
And I know her too.

272
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,291
She's softer now.

273
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,375
More trusting.

274
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,375
Open.

275
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:10,875
For what it's worth, I'm happy to see
the person she's become around you.

276
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,083
[sighs]

277
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,291
Your kindness is

278
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:21,416
unsettling.

279
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,125
[chuckles]

280
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,125
The procession has started,
and your portal awaits.

281
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:28,875
Let's go.

282
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,291
[bell tolling]

283
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,375
[mournful music]

284
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:51,875
[Aplegatt] I'll get to the Navy's
Commander in three days.

285
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:55,333
[Dijkstra] Make it two. The fate
of the Continent is resting on it.

286
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:59,208
- Do you have it memorized?
- A head of gold and an arse of iron.

287
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,833
Get on your horse and prove it.

288
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,541
I've consulted our networks.

289
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,958
Rience is a mystery in Nilfgaard too.

290
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,708
All communication goes
through the woman without a voice.

291
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,791
- Ironic.
- Hmm.

292
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,541
You seem nervous. Worried we're wrong?

293
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,375
Oh, our intelligence is sound.

294
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,750
So it's personal?

295
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:25,958
Hmm.

296
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:28,625
I simply want definitive answers

297
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:33,166
before we crash the Brotherhood's party
and start pointing fingers.

298
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:35,250
What's the word here?

299
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:39,541
Well, our position has been strengthened
by the influx of sympathy for our queen.

300
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,916
Even King Demavend
is proposing an alliance.

301
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,583
Soon, all the Northern Kingdoms
will be fighting at our behest.

302
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,125
[chuckles] Well done.

303
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,666
[troupe singing quietly]

304
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:01,291
There.

305
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,875
[loud clanking]

306
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,916
Judging by the size
and frequency of the ripples,

307
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,125
I suspect it's an aeschna.

308
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:15,333
An aeschna's skin is rough
and covered in spikes,

309
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:18,916
and difficult to penetrate except for
a tender patch on the top of its skull.

310
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,083
If we lure it into proximity,
we can strike from above

311
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:28,458
without any harm or damage
to the ferry or anyone on board.

312
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,416
Right?

313
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,041
Right.

314
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,875
Bet you wonder what I'm doing
in this part of the Continent.

315
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,791
You would lose that bet, Valdo.

316
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:43,541
Me and the troupe are playing
an exclusive gig.

317
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:45,250
Party of the century.

318
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,750
Upper echelon only.

319
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:51,333
I was personally requested
by the witch Sabrina Glevissig.

320
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,083
She admires both... my instruments.
If you catch my drift.

321
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,500
- That's not the only thing she'd catch.
- [chuckles]

322
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:02,125
If only you had one of these...
you could join me.

323
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,833
Pity.

324
00:19:03,916 --> 00:19:07,333
The pity is entirely yours, Valdo.

325
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:12,000
I... have... been... asked
to do a very important job,

326
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:15,291
very important...
very important, uh, uh... stakes,

327
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,375
personally requested
by the witch Yennefer of Vengerberg.

328
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,541
Heard of her? Much more important
than your witch. She blew up Sodden.

[loud boom]

[Obin] Have no fear!
We've a witcher on board.

331
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:29,208
Fear? A churlish cad
whose name I do not know.

332
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,500
[Valdo and Obin chuckle]

333

Need a new pair of breeches?

[wind whistling]

335
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:39,291
Let's talk about why you're struggling
with your magical abilities.

336
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:44,375
Your pride in my witchering skills really
would have been a better conversation.

337
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,125
Tough.

338
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,333
I thought if I learned magic...

339
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,750
it would make me a better leader.

340
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,125
Maybe my grandmother was right.

341
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,541
Maybe it's better
to govern with steel and steel alone.

342
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,708
Hmm.

343
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,333
As a witcher,

344
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:14,666
I will accept coin from someone,
no matter where they're from.

345
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:19,333
Nations are invisible lines
that people assign meaning to.

346
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,750
A life, however...

347
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,208
A life has real meaning.

348
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,333
It's warm skin and a beating heart.

349
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,375
It should only be taken as a last resort.

350
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,708
Righteousness can easily become rage.

351
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,708
Justice can easily become scorn.

352
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:47,541
If you want to be a queen,

353
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,666

[Vizimir] We are gathered here today

359
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,333
to honor the memory

360
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:17,666
of my beloved Queen Hedwig.

361
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:23,500
To many, Queen Hedwig
was a stern and distant figure.

362
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:28,458
But to me, she was as large in stature
as she was of heart.

363
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,875
- [gasps]
- I'd like a word.

364
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:32,666
- Is this really the time?
- [Vizimir] Though you were barren...

365
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,916
You'd have made it harder for me
if it wasn't.

366
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,458
[Vizimir] ...in many ways,
you were a mother to me.

367
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:41,541
I was expecting Tissaia
to send a liaison for your little party.

368
00:21:42,291 --> 00:21:45,125
If I'd known it was you,
I would have fire-proofed this place.

369
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:47,642
- [Vizimir] ...and indeed...
- So you're aware of the conclave.

370
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:51,791
We're Redanian Intelligence. We're aware
of what you ate for bloody breakfast.

371
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,458
Look, I know you haven't been
on good terms with the Brotherhood lately.

372
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:59,708
But Redania, of all kingdoms, can
appreciate the gravity of the situation.

373
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:00,791
[Vizimir] Dear brother...

374
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:04,333
- The need for us to unite against Emhyr.
- [Vizimir] ...know you will be there...

375
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:08,166
- How is your hunt for Rience going? Hmm?
- [Vizimir] ...join us in a bedchamber...

376
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,500
- Nice speech.
- [Vizimir] ...quite close to our own.

377
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:13,833
- Show me yours, I'll show you mine.
- But let us think of him no more.

378
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:18,250
For now, I cry vengeance
on those Nilfgaardian scoundrels!

379
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,434
- We will march into battle...
- [Yennefer] ...I understand that...

380
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,059
- [Philippa] Sometimes we are blind to...
- ...led by the memory...

00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,851
- of my queen's steely countenance...
- We both...

382
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,125
- [shushing]
- And we start today!

383
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:31,250
Right now! Go. Prepare.

384
00:22:32,708 --> 00:22:34,083
In your homes!

385
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,250
[snaps fingers]

386
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,958
- Traitorous elven mage.
- She was just leaving, Your Highness.

387
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:49,250
I came here to offer
my deepest condolences, my king.

388
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,875
And to assure you that the incident
at the abbey was misguided.

389
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:57,875
Serving nobility is
a mage's greatest purpose.

390
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,000
I also wanted to invite Philippa

391
00:23:03,708 --> 00:23:05,750
as an honored guest
at the Conclave of Mages.

392
00:23:05,833 --> 00:23:08,250
Which she has no inclination to accept.

393
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:14,166
In times like these,
monarchs need more reliable protection.

394
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,333
Like the Brotherhood offers.

395
00:23:16,416 --> 00:23:17,696
Completely unnecessary, my lord.

396
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,041
[Yennefer] Just look
at your darling wife's fate.

397
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:22,000
I insist she attend.

398
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:25,333
And Dijkstra.

399
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:29,833
And Radovid.
I won't take no for an answer.

I'm in acceptance of this particular path,

00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,666
but what will you do if I go to Aretuza?

407
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,500
Go after Rience again?

408
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,458
This is bigger than Rience.

409
00:24:21,083 --> 00:24:23,250

00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:45,875
[echoing breath]

477
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:48,583
[energy crackling]

478
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,416
- [whooshing]
- [gasps]

479
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,291
- [rumbling]
- [sighs]

480
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:02,375
[gasps]

481
00:29:02,416 --> 00:29:03,666
[rumbling fades]

482
00:29:05,125 --> 00:29:06,605
[Triss, muffled] What do you think...

483
00:29:06,666 --> 00:29:08,416
- [running footsteps]
- [door opens]

484
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:10,416
Yen.

485
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,916
- Are you all right?
- The portal, it was... it was corrupted.

486
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,666
[breathing heavily]
Like... like it... it was intercepted.

487
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,083
Don't be dramatic.

488
00:29:19,166 --> 00:29:21,583
Tor Lara's been emitting
strange frequencies lately.

489
00:29:21,666 --> 00:29:22,958
Retrograde nonsense.

490
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:25,541
No, I was... I was attacked.

491
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,791
An illusion.

492
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:29,333
It was stellacite ruins and...

493
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:31,833
a black sea, I...

494
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,458
- I need to talk to Tissaia.
- No.

495
00:29:35,833 --> 00:29:38,250
Something is going on here.
Something sinister.

496
00:29:38,916 --> 00:29:41,458
I know you want this conclave
to bring us together, but...

497
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:44,208
you need to be careful
who you can trust.

498
00:29:45,916 --> 00:29:47,000
Don't we all?

499
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:49,916
[melancholy music]

500
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,916
[gasps]

501
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,250
Let me.

502
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,250
- [echoing whoosh]
- [soft squishing]

503
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,458
[breathing shakily]

504
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:07,916
Yen.

505
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:09,875
Bringing Ciri here,

506
00:30:11,166 --> 00:30:12,958
it's a bad idea.

507
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:16,291
But Ciri's power is neither good or bad.

508
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,666
- Her choices will shape her destiny.
- That's not what I meant.

509
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,666
[whispers] It's her blood.

510
00:30:24,416 --> 00:30:25,750
Yes, she's elven.

511
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:29,708
So am I.
And do you know when I was most dangerous?

512
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:34,041
When I was desperate.
And powerless. And alone.

513
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,458
And that will not happen to her.
Not as long as I'm around.

514
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:43,166
[sniffling]

515
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,250
[walking away]

516
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:52,416
Stellacite...

517
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,541
- [Ciri] It's not too late.
- [troupe chatting]

518
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:06,083
We could go somewhere remote.
Live off the land, slay beasts.

519
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:08,000
Look, Ciri...

520
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,625
In that castle, I found young women
who were part of some horrific experiment.

521
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,291
Their bodies melted into a mound
of flesh, and veins, and blood.

522
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,458
Only one of them survived.

523
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:28,708
Her name is Teryn.

524
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,083
And she believes that she is you.

525
00:31:34,958 --> 00:31:35,875
What do you mean?

526
00:31:35,958 --> 00:31:38,041
They've implanted your memories

527
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,125
into her head.

528
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:45,250
Whoever Rience is working for,
their ultimate plan is to manipulate you.

529
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,666
And those women,
they're using them as test subjects.

530
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:54,875
There's nothing I want more
than to return to our normal life, but...

531
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:57,958
We have to protect more of these women
from getting hurt.

532
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,708
And find the mage who's behind this.

533
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,083
That's why we have to go to Aretuza.

534
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:18,125
[lively music]

535
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,166
[cheering]

536
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:47,333
I'm not dead!

537
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,916
- Ooh, surely we are needed elsewhere.
- Mmm...

538
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
No.

539
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,250
I'm okay, actually.

540
00:33:01,083 --> 00:33:02,250
Gregor, I'm empty.

541
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:04,541
What? You can't get more ale
for a fortnight?

542
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,166
I just said I'm parched.

543
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,041
This is a bloody tavern.
What the fuck do we do without ale?

544
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:12,666
Aretuza has drained us dry. Every
bloody mage in the world will be there.

545
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,208
- You know how that lot fucking drink.
- Boy, don't I.

546
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:16,291
Well...

547
00:33:17,291 --> 00:33:19,000
at least I'm not a mage.

548
00:33:19,083 --> 00:33:23,166
That's just the start of our problems.
The roads aren't safe for the caravans.

549
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:26,541
I'm hearing boats are goin' missin'
up and down the western coast.

550
00:33:26,625 --> 00:33:28,833
- War is in the air, Gregor.
- You say "boats"?

551
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,291
[Gregor] Who keeps
filling these with flowers?

552
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:36,583
Will this shut you up?

553
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,291
We'll have to see.

554
00:33:39,291 --> 00:33:41,458
Whilst he tells me about the boats.

555
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,500
- [woman] ...head injury!
- [Boris] I forgot. Across the hair, it...

556
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:48,791
[Valdo] Boris! You're on pitch!

557
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:51,666
[Yennefer] So, the intrepid explorers
have arrived.

558
00:33:52,416 --> 00:33:54,583
You look like you had quite the adventure.

559
00:33:57,291 --> 00:33:59,791
You stink. Vile.

560
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:02,375
- [troupe begin playing]
- What happened to you, Yen?

561
00:34:03,916 --> 00:34:05,041
Are you all right?

562
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:08,208
- I'm fine. I'll tell you later.
- [bards harmonizing]

563
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:11,000
[Geralt] Yes, we have
a few things to discuss.

564
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,625
[Jaskier] Hello again, witch.
I know you were too embarrassed

565
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:18,083
to invite a big name like me
to headline at the, uh, conclave thingy,

566
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,875
but I just wanted to let you know I'm...

567
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:25,000
[loudly] I'm happy to do the other,
very important job that you requested.

568
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:29,958
Excellent.
You'll be looking after Ciri tonight.

569
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:32,458
- What?
- [Jaskier] I mean, I was vamping, come on.

570
00:34:34,208 --> 00:34:35,333
I shouldn't have left.

571
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:37,916
I'm sorry.

572
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:42,958
I shouldn't have given you
a reason to leave. I'm sorry.

573
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:45,541
Let's never do that again.

574
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,166
[quiet music]

575
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:57,666
Jaskier, if you would.

576
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,750
[Jaskier] Hmm?

577
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,583
Ooh, yes. Uh, yeah, absolutely.
Come on, kiddo.

578
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:06,500
Why don't you tell me all about
how you slayed the sea monster

579
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:11,000
all on your own whilst Geralt sat around
on his arse all afternoon, eh?

580
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:20,666
[as Yennefer] "Oh! What the hell
were you thinking, fighting monsters?"

581
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,125
- That's not what she's saying.
- Now, that is the role of poetry, Ciri.

582
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,750
To say what others cannot utter.

583
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:34,333
[as Geralt] "Oh, you fed her
to the magical lion's den. I trusted you."

584
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:37,625
- You're just making this all up.
- [Jaskier chuckles]

585
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:39,750
Meh. That's also the role of poetry.

586
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:42,458
[as Yennefer] "At least
she was in disguise there."

587
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:43,916
"Not clanging stupid swords

588
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,500
when I told her
not to draw attention to herself."

589
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:47,666
[Ciri clears throat]

590
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,851
- [growls]
- [Jaskier laughs]

591
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:50,595
[as Geralt] "Funny,
I wonder how she learned

592
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:53,833
such complete
and utter disregard for authority."

593
00:35:53,916 --> 00:35:55,500
That was a good one. [laughs]

594
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:58,166
- "You're unbelievable!" [laughs]
- "You're delusional!"

595
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:05,958
"I forgive you
for your various foolish words and deeds."

596
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:08,041
"Your lack of faith and hope."

597
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,500
"For your obstinacy. Doggedness."

598
00:36:12,291 --> 00:36:15,041
"For your sulking and posing,
which are unworthy of a man."

599
00:36:16,125 --> 00:36:19,333
"I forgive you for being a wily witch

600
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:21,333
who rarely listens

601
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:24,166
and even more rarely
admits to being wrong."

602
00:36:24,958 --> 00:36:29,291
"Who is stubborn,
and stuck-up, and self-righteous."

603
00:36:31,083 --> 00:36:32,203
"Let's never do that again."

604
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:35,708
[Jaskier as Yennefer]
"Mmm. Oh. Oh! Oh yes, take me."

605
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:38,041
[as Geralt] "Do that thing
with the tongue that I like."

606
00:36:38,125 --> 00:36:39,583
"Oh, you mean this? Bleugh, bleugh!"

607
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:42,625
"Oh yeah, that's the stuff.
Is there a unicorn nearby, by any chance?"

608
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:44,708
- [both laughing]
- "Oh!"

609
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:48,833
[Ciri sighs]

610
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,708
Come on, you deviant.

611
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:53,791
[wistful music]

612
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,125
[music fades]

613
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:10,916
Give me all your money.

614
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,458
[lively music]

615
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:20,250
- Oh, come on! Every time!
- [laughs]

616
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,375
- Wh... Ah... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Ha-ha!

617
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:24,375
I thought we were playing for fun.

618
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:27,291
I assure you, it truly is a delight
taking your coin.

619
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:28,875
Yeah, I'm sure you do.

620
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,416
[sighs]

621
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,875
Um... I'm sorry you're here with me.
Instead of at the party.

622
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:40,958
Oh, I'm not.

623
00:37:42,291 --> 00:37:45,791
Valdo's off-key warbling
would make my ears bleed.

624
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:46,875
[Ciri chuckles]

625
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:49,583
Besides, I'm better off here.

626
00:37:51,083 --> 00:37:52,083
Playing nanny.

627
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Hey.

628
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:57,416
You don't have to do that.

629
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:02,416
You don't have to prove
what you're going to be in the future.

630
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,041
My two orens?
