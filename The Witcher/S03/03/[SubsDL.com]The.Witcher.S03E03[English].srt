1
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,375
[chirping]

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,666
[Jaskier] Vespula? Vespula!

3
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,166
Are you even listening?

4
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,666
What does Radovid even mean, I see people?

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,083
How does he know what I see?
I mean, he's only met me, like, twice.

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,958
[traders shouting outside]

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:35,166
Nah... You can't play a player.
That's what I always say.

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,666
He's hiding something,
and if I'm gonna help Geralt,

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,375
I need to find out what that is.

10
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,708
Because Geralt is...

11
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,250
a hammer.

12
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,750
- [cockerel crows]
- You know?

13
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,958
[hooves clattering]

14
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,625
You're confused.

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,958
All right... Wait... Okay. Ah...

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,625
When you're a hammer,
every problem is a nail.

17
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,666
You see a nail
and you're like, "Grrr. Fuck this nail."

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,500
"Fuck this nail, in particular."
And you hammer the nail.

19
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,333
But sometimes
the problem is something else.

20
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:14,000
Sometimes the problem is, uh...
a bunch of petunias,

21
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:18,375
or a bowl of... porridge,
and you can't hammer a bowl of porridge.

22
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,333
I mean, you can try,
but then your hammer gets all gunked up,

23
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,958
porridge goes everywhere,
and then you have... no porridge.

24
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,750
The solution requires

25
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,458
a different kind of tool.

26
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,416
And Radovid... is that tool.

27
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,958
Radovid is... a spoon.

28
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:46,000
- Oh, obviously.
- Obviously. Yeah.

29
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,666
Aah... Yeah, I'm aware
this doesn't make a lot of sense.

30
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,333
What I'm trying to say is,
the problem is different.

31
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,333
The solution needs to be different.

32
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,833
And Radovid... is different.

33
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:07,708
He's intelligent.
He tries to hide it, but he's insightful.

34
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,666
Sharp... like a knife.

35
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,250
If he's a knife,
I need to keep him away from Geralt.

36
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,458
[Vespula] You like him!

37
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,125
Who, Geralt? Yeah, I guess.

38
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:25,958
Platonically, and occasionally with
great effort, as one would a family goat.

39
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,125
- Hang on, when did you get dressed?
- I mean the spoon guy.

40
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,166
What, Radovid? No!

41
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,250
- [Vespula] Yes.
- No!

42
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,791
I've cursed you
for chasing tail of every kind.

43
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,958
Men, women, dwarves,

44
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,750
elves, polymorphous...

45
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:43,041
That was one time and I... regret nothing.

46
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,333
- It was amazing.
- Hmm.

47
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:48,041
But never have I ever
seen you have a crush.

48
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,708
[playful music]

49
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,166
- A crush?
- Mmm.

50
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,583
Oh, you think I have crushes.

51
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:54,750
Mmm-hmm.

52
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,208
- Crushes are for children, my darling.
- Mmm?

53
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,458
[Vespula gasps]

54
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,458
- [Jaskier] I have mind-bending...
- Mmm?

55
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,958
...world-ending,

56
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,166
heart-wrenching affairs.

57
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,166
- Whatever you say.
- [laughs]

58
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,208
- The Lothario of Lyria.
- Oh!

59
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,166
- The Romancer of Redania!
- Aah!

60
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,166
- The Stud of Cidaris!
- [laughs]

61
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,875
- [banging on door]
- [Geralt] Jaskier.

62
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,625
For fuck's...

63
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,958
Sorry. It's the family goat.

64
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,250
[Jaskier] Good to see you too.
How'd it go?

65
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,916
[Geralt] Not quite as expected.

66
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,875
[Jaskier] Did you find the castle?

67
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,000
Please tell me you killed Firefingers.

68
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,500
- [horse neighs]
- [Geralt] Rience wasn't there.

69
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,416
I did find something else, though.

70
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,166
Yeah, and what's that?

71
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,083
[girl talking]

72
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,500
- [Geralt] Her.
- [murmuring]

73
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,000
[Jaskier] And she is?

74
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,583
I don't know.

75
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,666
[girl] Ooh, ooh... ooh!

76
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,250
But she thinks she's Ciri.

77
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,541
[girl] Always a source. No room for...

78
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,166
I hate you. Ooh!

79
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,250
[Geralt] It's all right... Ciri.

80
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,541
- This is a friend.
- [muttering]

81
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,416
I'm Jaskier.

82
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,208
[girl] Always a source.
No room for vermin.

83
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,333
- Always.
- Fuck. Is she all right?

84
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,291
She was part of an experiment.

85
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,083
- [girl] Don't be...
- The only survivor.

86
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,375
[whimpering]

87
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,916
She has lucid moments,
but reverts back to this.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,083
[singing]

89
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,958
Whatever she's rambling about,

90
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,041
it's stuck in her head
in a nonsensical loop.

91
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,250
I need to find out why.

92
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,500
[Jaskier] Please tell me you have a plan.

93
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,583
[Geralt] We're taking her to Anika.

94
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,875
If this is an enchantment,
she'll be able to fix it.

95
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,125
And who's Anika?

96
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,208
She's a druid.
And a friend of my mother's.

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
[girl chuckling softly]

98
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,041
[dramatic music]

99
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,500
- [man] Yep, it's him all right.
- [Roach snorts]

100
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,791
Smelled you from two hilltops away.

101
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,416
What are you doing here, Otto?

102
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,791
Blame the heightened senses,
but we both know you're a ripe old bugger.

103
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,083
I suppose you're here for a reason.

104
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,583
[girl murmuring]

105
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,583
- [Geralt] Hello, Anika.
- [girl] Wait. Just...

106
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,750
- [Otto] She's missed you too.
- [sighs]

107
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,250
Come on.

108
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,416
[rustling]

109
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,750
- [clattering]
- [Jaskier] Whew! Oh, that burns.

110
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,750
That burns like a RarÃ³g's arsehole.

111
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,791
- [chuckles] What is it?
- [Otto] Uh, that's table salt.

112
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,708
[Jaskier coughing] Yeah.

113
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,125
Ooh-hoo.

114
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,791
Yep, that's just, uh...
that's just table salt.

115
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,250
That's not, um... not very druidic.

116
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,541
- I'm not a druid.
- Oh, right.

117
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,541
I'm a werewolf.

118
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,041
Whoa. What? You're... What? Uh, a...

119
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,708
[chuckles] I was bit,
back in the plague of '21.

120
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,291
Went out to the woods to isolate.
Avoid the disease.

121
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,958
Was so worried about boils
and shitting myself to death,

122
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,666
I wasn't thinking about werewolves.

123
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,041
Priority, yeah. I get it.

124
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,750
Geralt was hired by the villagers
to kill me.

125
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,833
He found me a cure instead.

126
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,625
- Kept close to my chest, it keeps me safe.
- Oh.

127
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,666
Almost got himself killed
in the process, but...

128
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,250
he saved my life.

129
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,875
Yeah. Seems about right.

130
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,958
[girl murmuring softly]

131
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,041
I don't know...

132
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,125
How'd you and Otto meet?

133
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,291
It was about a year ago.

134
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,666
We were at the Temple of Truth. Mourning.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,333
His wife, Edwina, was killed in a fire.
The children too.

136
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,166
I was there for Visenna.

137
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,041
She's dead?

138
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,333
She talked about you a lot at the end.

139
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,666
[mournful music]

140
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,541
Well, whoever did this
fucked her up pretty good.

141
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,625
It's a mind-control enchantment.

142
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,833
[Geralt] Mind control?

143
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,125
So someone needs her
to believe she's Ciri.

144
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,833
It's extremely powerful.

145
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,125
Elements of Chaos, druidic magic,

146
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,583
even some ancient elven sorcery
in the spell.

147
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,833
Oh, that's another thing.
She's part elven.

148
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,541
Maybe a couple
of generations removed, but still.

149
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,333
Poor girl's head's a tangled mess.

150
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,208
Who would have the power to do this?

151
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,916
I don't know anyone
with the knowledge to do this.

152
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,541
It would take lifetimes
to acquire all these tricks.

153
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,958
Whoever this mage is,
they have quite a variety of interests.

154
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,000
[Otto] An extraction elixir.

155
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,250
[Anika] Well done, Otto.

156
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,458
[uncorks bottle]

157
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,208

Ah, it'll take a while,
and there's no guarantee.

163
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,958
If it works, she'll be able
to tell us who did this.

164
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,958
[Geralt] And what they want with Ciri.

165
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,833
[dramatic music]

166

[seabirds calling]

167
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,916
- [bell tinkles]
- [Ciri] This is the dwarven bank.

168
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,875
- I thought we were going to Aretuza.
- [Yennefer] We are.

169
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,250
But as you said yourself,
there's always more to the picture.

170
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,958
- Aah! [laughs]
- [dwarf] My eyes deceive me!

171
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,541
For surely,
a creature this beautiful cannot be real!

172
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,541
My sweet Yennefer,

173
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,583
it is the most sumptuous of pleasures,
as always.

174
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,875
- The pleasure is all mine, Giancardi.
- Mmm!

175
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,250
Please, take a seat
while we finalize your arrangements.

176
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:18,458
[Giancardi] Horror!
Pure 'orror on my family's faces,

177
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,375
as they watched me
dragged away to certain death,

178
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,833
their own fate hanging in the balance.

179
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,541
When who should appear?
A goddess from the heaven?

180
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,666
- Better! Yennefer of Vengerberg.
- [Yennefer giggles]

181
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,125
She blasted the villainous wretches
into dust.

182
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,000
You exaggerate my heroism.

183
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,250
[Giancardi] Nonsense.

184
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,416
This is why the Giancardi Bank,
mind well the name,

185
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,583
will do anything for a friend.

186
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,625
For your other matter,

187
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,541
my most secure vault is yours.

188
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,625
Thank you.

189
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,416
If it's not too much to ask,
I have one more favor.

190
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,041
- [Giancardi] Sure.
- My ward needs a chaperone.

191
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,666
- Say no more.
- [Ciri] What?

192
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,875
Fabio is at your disposal.

193
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,166
I thought you said
this was important for my future.

194
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,500
It is. But first, my past must be settled.

195
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,250
I know you're nervous.
Let me be there with you.

196
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,750
[whimsical music]

197
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,625
There.

198
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,625
Now you look ordinary.

199
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,750
Stop that.

200
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,333
No one is after you here.
You're just a normal girl having fun.

201
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,750
Take this. Buy something nice.

202
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,875
Now, let me see that talisman
you're constantly fiddling with.

203
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,666
- [speaking in Elder]
- [shimmering sound]

204
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,250
What's that for?

205
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,083
A locator spell.

206
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,416
If you get into any trouble,
hold this tight and recite the chant.

207
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,833
But don't get into any trouble.

208

- [Vizimir growls]

213
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,166
Your Highness, uh...

214
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,333
there seems to be
some confusion among your advisors.

215
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,583
- [clang]
- [Vizimir] Yes!

[man groans]

217
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,458
- Did you see that?
- Yes, very good.

218
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,500
Whispers of a meeting
with an emissary from Nilfgaard?

219
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,625
Oh, that. Yes.

220
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,041
- We brokered a deal.
- [laughs]

221
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,041
Quite a good one. In the inevitable event
of their push North,

222
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,500
Nilfgaard has agreed
to leave Redania untouched.

223
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,791
And they're offering
half of Temeria as a vassal state.

224
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,875
Oh, pray tell, my lord, what's the return
on this generous Nilfgaardian investment?

225
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,916
Oh, nothing we can't afford.

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,875
"We"?

227
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,166
- [clang]
- [man groans]

228
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,958
And, should we find her first, we turn
the Princess of Cintra over to them.

229
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,375
You are being conned!

230
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,666
With all due respect, sir,
Nilfgaard are playing you for a fool.

231
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,458
With all due respect, Dijkstra,

232
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,083
you provide the intelligence,
I make the decisions.

[man groans]

237
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,625
Queen Hedwig sent me to see

238
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,333
if you're finished with the, uh...
important affairs of state?

239
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:31,791
She said to tell you they're here.
In case you wanted to say, uh... hello.

240
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,375
Oh, yes. Quite finished.

241
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,500
But you've still got two more serves.

242
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,958
It can wait. My sweet Hedwig can't.

243
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:42,458
Sire, as your most senior advisor,
I cannot stress enough that...

244
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,291
[Vizimir] You stress too much.

245
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:49,333
The only reason you have any power here,
Sigismund, is because of me.

246
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,166
Don't forget that.

247
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,375
[chuckles]

248
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,375
[door slams]

249
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,291
He doesn't take a shit
without me knowing about it.

250
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,208
No one gets a private audience with him
outside my purview.

251
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:07,083
Radovid told us they did. He was right.
And they're doing it again.

252
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,541
Vizimir's not scheming alone.

253
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,500
Queen Hedwig has been
in such a useful mood of late.

254
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,250
Perhaps it's time
to make her useful to us.

255
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,541
Or should I do it?

256
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,250
No. You have enough fires to fight.

257
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,500
Hmm.

258
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,208
Speaking of fires, annoyingly,
I met another dead end

259
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,416
through that portal in the shape
of an artsy-fartsy crafting studio.

260
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,833
Apparently, Rience is being backed
by someone with appalling taste.

261
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:35,583
I meant the portal itself.
You said it felt different. More powerful.

262
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,541
Perhaps it's time
to reach out to one of your old community.

263
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,750
- Tissaia might be useful.
- Ooh...

264
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,291
I only mean
that if what the bard says is true,

265
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,708
the witcher is on our scent.

266
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,708
If he gets to Rience first,
we lose the girl.

267
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,250
And our leverage.

268
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,375
Which is why we must both act now.

269
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,416
You know as well as I do, there are
many ways to persuade the stubborn.

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,041
Use Radovid.
Time for him to cut his teeth.

271
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,458
[Radovid] Yes, Dijkstra.

272
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,166
Use me.

273
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,791
Shall I, uh... chat with kitchen hands?

274
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,833
Uh, watch for shady carriages rolling up?

275
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,875
Shadow my brother's wife?

276
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,333
You seem nowhere close
to finding this powerful Princess Cirilla.

277
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,458
You're just so busy
with your royal duties,

278
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,208
I dare not split your focus.

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,750
I don't need your help.

280
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,750
Well, tell that to your king.

281
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,541
And your boss.

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,250
[door grinding]

00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:47,875
[Yennefer] You came.

- [coins shuffling]
- [door clangs shut]

285
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,208
Strange, isn't it?

286
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,500
Men bleed and kill for this stuff.

287
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,416
Only to let it rust.

288
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,166
In dark rooms.

289
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,750
[Yennefer] Because it's worthless.

290
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,291
It's too soft to make anything useful.

291
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,375
You can't eat it. Can't fuck it.

292
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,208
Though the King of Aedirn
used to like to try.

293
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,875
Its power comes
from believing in its value.

294
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,250
An illusion designed
to control the masses.

295
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,500
The leader of the Brotherhood
should know all about that.

296
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,291
She seems to know everything else.

297
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,458
You know, it started
to gnaw at me, back in Ellander.

298
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,625
Northerners killing their own.

299
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,875
[melancholy music]

300
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,458
The whispers of a dozen bounties
on Cirilla of Cintra.

301
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,541
When last everyone knew,
she was killed in the slaughter.

302
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,875
I think you learned Cirilla was alive
and shared the news,

303
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,250
hoping to curry favor
with the Northern kings.

304
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,583
Except no one can find her.
The Brotherhood is on their shit list,

305
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,500
and they're so focused
on terrorizing an orphan

306
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,583
that they can't see an empire
waiting to destroy them.

307
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,333
Curry favor?

308
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,916
I don't know what's more insulting.

309
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,083
That you think my goals so basic,

310
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,083
or that you free
a Nilfgaardian prisoner of war,

311
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,916
then lecture me on Northern unity.

312
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,625
What mess will you
leave us with this time?

313
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,666
I have been a mess.

314
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And I'm sorry.

315
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,875
When I tried to kill myself at Aretuza,
I was so desperate to control my destiny.

316
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,000
You weren't taking control.
You were losing it.

317
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,083
I know.

318
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,583
And I still feel like that sometimes.

319
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,041
Like I'm at a loss.

320
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,291
Rience. A fire mage.

321
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:47,291
He's after Cirilla too, but someone
far more powerful is backing him.

322
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,458
We can't let him get to her.

323
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:56,875
You want me to help hide a princess
whose existence means war?

324
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,375
I want more than that.

325
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,875
She's extraordinary.

326
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,541
She's the rightful heir to Cintra
and a great deal more, so I'm told.

327
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,041
If war is coming,
there is no hiding her from it.

328
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,416
Well, then, maybe
she can lead us out of it.

329
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,458
For all the Brotherhood's faults,
they respect magic.

330
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,250
She deserves to know
what hers is capable of.

331
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,500
She deserves control of her destiny.

332
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:26,166
Please.

333
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:30,166
Please help me make this right. For us.

334
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:32,916
For her.

335
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,333
After all this time...

336
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:43,333
After all your searching,
you actually did it.

337
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,541
Did what?

338
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,333
Became a mother.

339
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,750
[melancholy music swells]

340
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,500
[laughs]

341
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:57,125
[Fabio] Smart rates for a smart lady.

342
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,875
- Giancardi Bank, mind well the name.
- Yes, that's four.

343
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:04,000
- Smart rates for a smart gentleman.
- [man 1] No thanks, son.

344
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,625
- Smart rates for a smart lady?
- [woman] Oh, piss off.

345
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:10,250
Smart rates. Come by Giancardi Bank,
mind well the name, to open an account.

346
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,375
[man 2] Yeah, go on, then.

347
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,083
Smart rates for a smart lady.

348
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,083
Maybe you'd have better luck
if you didn't want it so bad.

349
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,583
Maybe I'd have better luck

350
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,708
if I wasn't with a girl
who pounds donuts like a truffle pig.

351
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,666
- Want one?
- I'm wheat intolerant.

352
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,625
Come by Giancardi Bank,
mind well the name, sir.

353
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,208
What's that place?

354
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,875
Thanedd Island.

355
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:42,375
Home to Aretuza.
That's the Tower of the Gull. Tor Lara.

356
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,791
Looks scary, doesn't it?

357
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,958
Legend has it, they take failing novices
to the caves below the tower

358
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,458
and turn them into eels.

359
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,375
Sounds more exciting than this market.

360
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,541
[goat bleats]

361
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,041
Spectacles here would haunt you to your
deathbed, you rude little duck's arse.

362
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:03,125
Try me.

363
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,916
[crowd, to melody of "The Wild Rover"]
<i>âª All hail Cintra âª</i>

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,375
- [man] Nilfgaard!
- [laughter]

369
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,708
Anyone give you any trouble?

370
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,416
Please. No one gives a shit
about this ancient elven garbage.

371
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
[rowdy cheering and laughter]

372
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:35,750
- Where's the book?
- There's no book on monotones.

373
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,166
- Monoliths.
- Whatever.

374
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,208
There is.
I've been researching for months.

375
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,291
Codringher and Fenn confirmed
it was buried in a Xin'trean cavern.

376
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,875
Where is the book?

377
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,083
If you let me finish, the book of whatever
had already been recovered.

378
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:51,166
- I assumed it'd been sent to you.
- Why would you assume that?

379
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,083
'Cause it went to Aretuza.

380
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,625
By order of the emperor himself.

381
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,083
You owe me 20 marks, Isturd.

382
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,583
It's Istredd.

383
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:04,791
Whatever.

384
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,666
All hail the White Flame.

385
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,250

Thought I was gonna shit my kecks
comin' through those gates.

389
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,541
Never seen anything quite like this place.

390
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,083
[Cahir] Well, you just wait.

391
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:40,208
If the Emperor likes our proposal,
you could be seeing a lot more of it.

392
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,166
[door opens]

393
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,208
My man says
you're from the Scoia'tael front.

394
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,291
What news do you bring, son?

395
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:47,541
Gallatin, sir.

396
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:50,000
- Bad news. We're getting slaughtered.
- [coughs]

397
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,916
Forgive me.
I'm a fighter, not a politician.

398
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,541
I don't really know
how to sugarcoat the truth.

399
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,541
All the better for it.

400
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,833
Continue.

401
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,250
[Gallatin] I've been a soldier
all my life.

402
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,958
I take no pleasure in jumping rank.

403
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:09,541
But Francesca has been siphoning off
our best fighters, our resources,

404
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:12,958
leading my men on side missions
straight to their graves.

405
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:16,791
[Emhyr] Well, Francesca has made
many sacrifices for her people.

406
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,208
What makes you think
her choices can't be trusted?

407
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,625
Her choices are
in defiance of your orders, sir.

408
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,541
She's not fighting to soften the North.
She's searching for a girl.

409
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,083
[inhales sharply]

410
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,750
I'd like you to stay awhile.

411
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,500
We can resolve this issue,
I have no doubt.

412
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,291
- Make sure this man is fed.
- [man] My lord.

413
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,500
[boots stamp]

414
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,041
Thank you.

415
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,583
[marching away]

416
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,666
[soldiers continue drilling outside]

417
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,166
Thank you, my lord.

418
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,750
I knew your righteousness would prevail.

419
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,791
[Emhyr] Is this a manipulation
to end your punishment?

420
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,250
Because, don't forget, it was deceit
that got you where you are now.

421
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,583
No, my lord.

422
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,000
I would not lie about this.

423
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:09,125
I asked for a private audience
to protect your secret.

424
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:12,708
But Cirilla... Cirilla is out there.

425
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,125
I am having dreams about her.

426
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,500
- She wants me to find her.
- You tried that once.

427
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,875
You failed.

428
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,083
My lord, I have been in the field.
Gallatin is a good fighter.

429
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,291
He knows the land.
The elves are loyal to him.

430
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,041
He can deliver us the North.

431
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,916
Division among the elves
would only hurt our cause on both fronts.

432
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:44,625
But, uh...

433
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:48,875
an army is only as good as its leader, uh...

434
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,250
I know a good leader when I see one.

435
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,666
It gave me... no pleasure to punish you.

436
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,916
But I had to know you could be trusted.

437
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:12,250
That I had not lost you.

438
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,541
Are you ready to come home, Cahir?

439
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:20,625
Yes.

440
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,083
Prove it.

441
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:44,166
[Jaskier] I think you've chopped
enough wood here for... two,

442
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:48,166
maybe three centuries of fire.

443
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:52,708
What's the plan, Geralt?

444
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:58,166
We wait for her to wake up,
make sure she's okay,

445
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,666
find Rience and the mage that did this,
and kill them.

446
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,000
And then what?

447
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:06,541
Yarpen told me he saw you
talking to Philippa Eilhart in Ban GleÃ¡n.

448
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,583
It's okay, Jaskier.

449
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:10,958
What did Dijkstra want you to do?

450
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,583
He wanted me to convince you

451
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,125
to take Ciri to Redania.

452
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,416
[chuckles]

453
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,708
And I agree with him.

454
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:27,500
She'd be safe with an army,
an entire army at her back.

455
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:31,250
Ciri would be nothing more
than a brood mare on the Cintran throne.

456
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,250
She's a princess, Geralt.

457
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,083
That's what princesses do.

458
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,458
They sit on little royal thrones
and they have little royal babies.

459
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,625
And they rule kingdoms.
This is what Ciri wants.

460
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:45,125
Does she want to be a political pawn
for Vizimir and Dijkstra?

461
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,333
- No...
- No.

462
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,333
We stay the course.

463
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,875
Neutrality has consequences too.

464
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:54,291
There are already consequences, Jaskier.
And not just for Ciri.

465
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:58,375
I thought by taking her off the board,
the world would stop trying to use her.

466
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,375
Instead, they're trying
to use others in her place.

467
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,000
And they will continue to.

468
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:07,333
Because that is what people in power do.

469
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,500
But she's not a witcher.

470
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:16,875
She's certainly not an Aretuzan witch
sourcing magic out of... stones, or hemp,

471
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:20,166
or plants,
or whatever it is that Yennefer does.

472
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,041
She's a princess.

473
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,625
I think you should trust her.

474
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,083
Her source.

475
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,583
Her... what now?

476
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,375
You're right.

477
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,666
[Jaskier] I'm right...

478
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,916
Well, that's deeply worrying. What?

479
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:49,041
[Anika] Geralt...

480
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,250
- I need you to wake up.
- [Anika] Geralt, no.

481
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,892
- [Otto] It's too soon.
- Can you hear me?

482
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:54,596
[Otto] You could hurt
the extraction spell.

483
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,250
You said there was always a source.

484
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,208
- [sighs]
- [Geralt] What did you mean?

485
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,208
Always a source to what?

486
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,458
Magic.

487
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,083
[Geralt] Can you tell me your name?

488
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,375
Teryn.

489
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,041
[Geralt] Good.

490
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,291
Something happened
that affected your mind.

491
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,833
Do you remember what happened?

492
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:20,625
[gasps]

493
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,500
I was dragged from my room.

494
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,583
Yes.

495
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,791
By a man.

496
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:27,541
A man with a scar?

497
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:28,875
[Anika] Careful, Geralt.

498
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:31,958
[Teryn, shakily] He was there. Sometimes.

499
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:37,833
And the woman with the funny voice.

500
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,791
They all helped the man.

501
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,125
The man, he...

502
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:47,208
He always scared me.

503
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,375
You knew him.

504
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,666
At school.

505
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:54,541
At Aretuza.

506
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,166
[gasps]

507
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,791
Oh... [sobbing]

508
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,375
We need to put her back under.

509
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,498
- [Geralt] I need a name.
- [Otto] I'll grab elixir.

510
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:04,833
- [wailing]
- It's all right.

511
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,708
- Just say it.
- What was his name, Teryn?

512
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,791
[screaming]

513
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,500
[wails]

514
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,041
[sobs]

515
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,625
[deep voice] Stupid witcher.

516
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,833
You're doomed and you don't even know it.

517
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,041
[overlapping voices]
I am Cirilla's destiny.

518
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,250
May all ye wail,

519
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:31,041
for the Destroyer of Nations is upon us.

520
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,250
[yelps]

521
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:37,041
Anika!

522
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,916
- [cracking sounds]
- [groaning]

523
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:42,750
[crunching]

524
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:44,500
[deep voice] Geralt!

525
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,375
- [growling]
- Jaskier, the amulet!

526
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,791
No, no, no, no. Teryn. Teryn!

527
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,958
- Jaskier!
- [roaring]

528
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:53,333
- [grunting]
- Geralt!

529
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,791
[Otto] Ah! Aah...

530
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,541
- [Teryn gasping]
- [Jaskier] Shh, shh.

531
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,291
- [Otto sighing]
- [Teryn whimpering]

532
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,958
[Jaskier] Shh, shh.

533
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,416
[barker] Roll up! Roll up!

534
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,250
Roll up!

535
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:18,791
See with your own eyes

536
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:22,250
the most frightful creature
the gods ever created!

537
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:27,208
A live basilisk, the venomous terror
of the Zerrikanian desert!

538
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,750
An insatiable man-eater!

539
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,291
- Only 15 groats.
- Told you.

540
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,666
[barker] That's 15 groats, yeah?
Hey, you, hop it.

541
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,708
15 groats, everyone. Yeah, go on.
Pay the money to the boy.

542
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:38,666
In you go. Enjoy. In you go.

543
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,583
Enjoy the show.
[chuckles] Enjoy the show.

544
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,458
[barker continues shouting]

545
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,750
[man] Come on, hurry up!

546
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:51,708
Careful. These beasts
are notoriously unpredictable.

547
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:53,583
I've fought enough of them to know.

548
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,625
[woman] Hey, let's get to the front.

549
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,416
[growling]

550
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,125
- [Ciri] That cage looks small.
- Maybe it's a baby basilisk.

551
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:05,708
That would be a rip-off.
How scary could that be?

552
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,083
You'd be surprised.

553
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,458
They are unpredictable.

554
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,333
And unpredictable means trouble.

555
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,250
What's wrong with a little trouble?

556
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,625
[scoffs] A lot if you've lived my life.

557
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,916
That sounds like a challenge.

558
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,541
[soft clink]

559
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,250
[growling continues]

560
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:30,958
Ladies and gentlemen!

561
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,791
[laughing]

562
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,333
The king of all serpents.

563
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,833
'Tis a most rare monster.

564
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,083
- [thump]
- [squealing]

565
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:44,000
Hatching from an egg
only laid by a knavish cockerel, well!

566
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,666
Who presents his rump to another...

567
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,041
in the manner of a horny hen!

568
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,750
- Ooooh!
- [laughter]

569
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,291
Cock-a-doodle-doo-ooh-ooh!

570
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:57,041
Ta-da!

571
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,041
[crowd gasps]

572
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,166
An egg that must be brooded

573
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,833
by a hundred and one venomous snakes.

574
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,166
[growling]

575
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,375
Good people, keep your distance.

576
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:11,416
Its breath alone could poison you.

577
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,083
- [Ciri] That's not a basilisk.
- [gasps and murmurs]

578
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,708
[man] Stop interrupting, love.

579
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:19,458
When the basilisk hatches,

580
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:22,333
it devours the snakes,
imbibing their venom.

581
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:25,125
And when a knight stabs it with his sword,

582
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,625
the poison runs up the blade,
killing the knight...

583
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,708
- Chhkk, chhkk! Outright.
- [crowd gasps]

584
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:31,250
That is the falsest lie.

585
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,833
'Tis the truest truth.

586
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:37,250
That's why a basilisk can only be killed
by seeing its reflection in the mirror.

587
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,791
Quite right, sir!

588
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:41,416
- Don't.
- No, you're all wrong. This is a wyvern.

589
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,208
And it's young, and it's starving
because you're keeping it in this cage!

590
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:47,041
[laughs mockingly]

591
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,583
Listen, darlin',
if you don't like my little show,

592
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:52,166
why don't you just piss off and shut up?

593
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:56,208
- [wyvern squeals]
- [barker groans]

Oi, oi, you little shit!

603
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,708
This girl is under the protection
of Giancardi Bank.

604
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:40,500
Mind well the name, arsehole.

Here!

[woman] Who is she? Is she okay?

613
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,625
- [Ciri groans]
- [knight] Get off of her, devil dog!

614
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:14,250
You saved me, brave knight!

615
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,375
We have a hero in our midst!

616
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,250
- He saved us all!
- [knight] I did?

617
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,208
- I did!
- [Ciri] I have to get out of here!

618
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:25,166
[Fabio] That was fucking incredible!
Did you see me hit that guy?

619
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,930
- [Ciri] Yennefer will kill me.
- I'll get fired, I don't even care!

620
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,791
- Where the fuck's my money?
- I can travel.

621
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:32,355
- Kick arse through this fucking Continent!
- Where's my money?

Fucking hell.

626
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:46,375
I've gotta go. Thank you.

627
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:49,708

- And good luck kicking arse!

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,333
Another runaway.
You've had your fun, novice.

635
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,375
- Back to the dorms.
- Get your hands off me!

636
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,958
[gasps]

637
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,333
You will address me
as Mistress Laux-Antille.

638
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,833
And you'll clean the toilets
for your impertinence.

639
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,276
[Yennefer] I'll take it from here.

640
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,833
[Mistress Laux-Antille] Yen.

641
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,750
[Sabrina] What are you doing here?

642
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:31,291
Bringing my ward
to get a proper education,

643
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,333
one she obviously sorely needs.

644
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,083
Forgive her, Rita.

645
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,500
So this is the girl.

646
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:46,708
Don't look at her.

647
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,333
Look at me.

648
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,208
Don't you dare take your eyes off me.

649
00:33:57,541 --> 00:33:59,541
[low rumbling]

650
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,646
- [Yennefer] That's enough introductions.
- [breathing shakily]

651
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:11,583
As an apology for her impudence, allow me
to treat you ladies to some luxury.

652
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,541
[Sabrina] Thank gods, I'm bored.

653
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,833
Shall we take the waters
at the Silver Heron?

654
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:16,833
[both giggle]

655
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:19,041
[Rita] Don't threaten me with a good time.

656
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,166
[gasps]

657
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:23,916
[sighs]

658
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:26,541
[echoing laughter]

659
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,416
[Rita chuckles] Hands off. He's mine.

660
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:36,416
[Sabrina] I wasn't planning
on using my hands.

661
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,000
[Rita] Fuck magic, let's stay here.

662
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:52,208
[Sabrina] If this place ever closes,
I'll burn this fucking city to the ground.

663
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,291
Here, girl!

664
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,708
Novices these days are useless.

665
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:01,250
- [Sabrina] Mmm.
- [Rita] Not like when we were girls.

666
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,500
I told you to bring the wine.

667
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:07,083
I'm surprised you can taste anything
at this point.

668
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,166
Are you calling me a lush?

669
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,541
Better a lush than a traitor.

670
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,166
Tell me, Yennefer.

671
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,416
Are the rumors about witchers true?

672
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,166
That their mutations make them impotent?

673
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,625
- [Rita] You're fucking a witcher? [laughs]
- [Sabrina] Atrocious, isn't it?

674
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:28,041
- Almost as atrocious as your manners.
- Mmm.

675
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,625
- [Rita] Ooh.
- [Sabrina giggles]

676
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:33,791
Perhaps instead of dwelling on the past,
focus our attention on the future.

677
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,333
I wanted red!

678
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:37,541
[Sabrina] Here.

679
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:39,416
We deserve a drink.

680
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:42,875
After all the fires
we've been putting out between kingdoms.

681
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,916
Fires we didn't start.

682
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,416
[Rita] Damned Cintran princess.

683
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,125
- What's so special about her, anyway?
- [Sabrina] Mmm.

684
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,375
Girl, the wine! Now.

685
00:35:58,416 --> 00:35:59,416
Get it yourself.

686
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,541
[bangs pitcher down]

687
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:05,875
[laughs]

688
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:07,333
She'll only screw it up.

689
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:10,041
Besides, I know where the good stuff is.

690
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,583
[gasps]

691
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,750
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Shut the fuck up.

692
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:22,458
- Before you spoil everything.
- I can't spoil something already rotten!

693
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:24,958
This place, these women, it's horrible!

694
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,625
"This place"? You're not a princess here.

695
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,750
You're a low-level novice.
Get used to being treated like one.

696
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,875
Entitlement will get you nowhere.

697
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,375
[breathing heavily]
I don't want to do this.

698
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:37,598
You know, I don't want to do this either.

699
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:40,666
Tomorrow I'll be expected
to crawl back to the Brotherhood,

700
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,125
tail between my legs,
begging for forgiveness.

701
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,500
And I'll do it.

702
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:48,625
Because Aretuza is my best hope
of protecting you from those who hunt you.

703
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,958
<i>Our </i>best chance to be safe.

704
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,541
- You have to go along to get along.
- To what end?

705
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:59,208
If I can't learn to control my powers,
will you let Tissaia turn me into an eel?

706
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:02,291
And if I do become
some powerful, learned Aretuzan maid,

707
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,125
will you let her scrape out my insides

708
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:07,083
to become vapid and power-hungry
like your friends out there?

709
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:10,500
Tissaia is one of the most
powerful sorceresses on this Continent!

710
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:13,041
You should be grateful
she's willing to teach you!

711
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:14,416
[breathing heavily]

712
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,041
[whispers] Just because she saved you

713
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,875
does not mean
you owe her the rest of your life.

714
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,750
You told me
to never apologize for my power,

715
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:29,166
and yet that's all you seem to do.

716
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:33,666
You want to be a great leader?
You want to change the world?

717
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,791
Well, the day-to-day of leading

718
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:38,583
is dealing with a lot of vapid,
power-hungry arseholes!

719
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,291
I'm not Geralt.

720
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:46,791
This isn't Kaer Morhen.

721
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:50,333
This is the version of myself
I have to be here.

722
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:54,166
So you need to find a version of yourself
that can deal with that.

723
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,500
Trust me, I know you're not Geralt.

724
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,791
- He would never sell his soul like this.
- [sobbing]

725
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,375
- [yells]
- [glass clatters]

726
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:07,958
[sobbing]

727
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,208
[fire crackling]

728
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,583
- [owl hooting]
- [sighs]

729
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:20,625
[gasping]

730
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:23,208
- It's all right.
- [sighs]

731
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:27,166
Thanks to Otto.

732
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:31,125
I've never seen
someone make a potion so fast.

733
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,333
You taught him well.

734
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:36,750
[sighs] Just like Visenna taught me.

735
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,375
Did she suffer?

736
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,791
She was mistaken for an elf
while helping a villager.

737
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:51,458
[mournful music]

738
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:54,208
She was beaten very badly.

739
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,250
Does that make you feel better or worse?

740
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,083
I never wanted her to hurt.

741
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:09,000
- Just wanted her to know what she did.
- Oh, she knew.

742
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:13,583
Love for a child forces parents to make
the hardest choices of their lives.

743
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,083
Impossible ones, even.

744
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:21,166
Chances are, they toil over it
for the rest of their lives.

745
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:32,625
I do remember bits of our life.

746
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,041
She smelled like embers.

747
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:44,458
From keeping those measly fires alive
for the long nights.

748
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,375
I remember my hunger.

749
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:53,125
And her stomach growling
twice as loud as mine.

750
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,083
She used her magic

751
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,291
to create elaborate meals
that we couldn't afford.

752
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:10,208
I would have done anything
to make her smile.

753
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,375
And yet...

754
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,208
the day she left me,

755
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,291
she was sick.

756
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:26,125
She needed water,
so I went to get her some.

757
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,000
And when I came back...

758
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:31,666
she was gone.

759
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,375
I called for her.

760
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:40,458
But she was gone.

761
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,833
She loved you the best she could.

762
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:48,208
To save you, she had to let you go.

763
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:53,541
- This can't have been the only choice.
- It wasn't.

764
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,625
It's simply the one she made.

765
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,416
And now you have
your own impossible decision.

766
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,250
I won't abandon Ciri.

767
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:05,458
Even if it costs me my life.

768
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:08,333
[sighs]

769
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:12,041
Teryn.

770
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:17,541
Can she stay here,
while I work out how to help her?

771
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:20,208
- Mmm, of course.
- Thank you.

772
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,458
Where are you going?

773
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,958
Aretuza. [sighs]

774
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:32,416
[water splashing gently]

775
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:36,916
[quiet laughter]

776
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,666
Are you all right?

777
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,166
No.

778
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,750
The magic is one thing.

779
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,833
- But the politics...
- Hmm.

780
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:53,875
Even if I can curry enough favor to get
back into the Brotherhood's fold

781
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,666
and get her trained, you're right.

782
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,041
War is coming,
and she's at the center of it.

783
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:02,083
Mages have kept kings in check
for centuries.

784
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:07,541
- We'll find a way.
- Toxicity's infectious.

785
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:13,750
The kings have turned against each other.
How long before mages follow suit?

786
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,916
If we are to unite the North,
we must be united.

787
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,166
[Tissaia chuckles]

788
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:22,875
A conclave.

789
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,041
What?

790
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:28,333
We host a conclave of mages.

791
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:33,291
- We haven't had one since before Sodden.
- And then we went to war.

792
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,166
So we do it differently this time.

793
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:40,000
Instead of discord and debate,
we focus on trust.

794
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:41,958
Togetherness.

795
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:49,166
Is this also the girl's doing?

796
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:52,875
If we have any hope
of appealing to the kings,

797
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,541
we first have to find
better versions of ourselves.

798
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:00,916
I'm willing to try.

799
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:03,583
Are you?

800
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,208
- [chuckles]
- [laughter downstairs]

801
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,625
[wistful music]

802

[dog barking]

803
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,208
[breathing shakily]

804
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:24,291
[whispers] Geralt.

805
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:26,375
Hey, Geralt, where are you?

806
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:28,958
- [whispering voices]
- Geralt, where are you?

807
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,681
- [wind whistling]
- [voice] <i>Who's Geralt?</i>

808
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,291
- [voices overlapping]
- Where are you?

809
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,416
[jumbled voices and laughter]

810
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,625
[voice whispers] <i>He's coming. Now.</i>

811
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,416
[Geralt] <i>We'll meet again soon.</i>

812
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:43,750
[mouth full] I understand your concerns.
But I've made up my mind.

813
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:46,208
This Cirilla nonsense is
too much of a headache.

814
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,916
I couldn't agree more, Your Majesty.

815
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:52,375
But bargaining with Nilfgaard
is not the answer.

816
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:56,625
- The queen is opinionated and strong.
- Like a bull.

817
00:43:56,708 --> 00:44:00,375
And Radovid is eager to please.
But all three of you are far too important

818
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:03,708
to burden yourself with the minutiae
of Redanian intelligence.

819
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,708
What would you suggest?

820
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:10,583
Hope I'm not interrupting.
Uh, this was left with my manservant.

821
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,750
- The note says it's for you.
- Oh.

822
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:16,333
A present. [chuckles]

823
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:23,000
"Courtesy of Nilfgaard."
See, I told you, Dijkstra.

824
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,375
They're not so ba...

825
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,333
[yelps]

826
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:29,333
[gasps]

827
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,166
- [wailing]
- [coughing]

828
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:33,250
[Vizimir sobbing]

829
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,250
I want men on every door and window.
Nobody in or out but me!

830
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:39,541
Tell the gatekeeper
to scout the perimeter.

831
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:41,833
Bring me
Radovid's manservant immediately!

832
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:44,000
- [sobbing]
- [guard 1] With me! Now!

833
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:46,500
Man on every door! We've got intruders!

834
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,666
[whispers] I swear to you,
I will not let them get away with this.

835
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:52,886
- [men running]
- [guard 1] Guard the gates!

836
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:54,798
- Come. Come.
- [guard 2] Secure the perimeter!

837
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,791
- Through that gate!
- [guard 3] By me!

838
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,750
- Through there, now!
- Come.

839
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,333
- Take the king to his chambers.
- My lord.

840
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:06,625
- [distant door slams]
- [guards yelling]

841
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,833
- [sighs]
- [Vizimir sobbing]

842
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,083
[nearby door slams]

843
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,083
[intriguing music]

844
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:18,208
Hmm.

845
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:23,916
[Radovid gasps]

846
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,166
Mmm. Hah!

847
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:28,625
You.

848
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,791
All that talk of...
making the queen more useful.

849
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,333
You and Philippa did this.

850
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,166
You won't get away with it.

851
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:41,541
Huh.

852
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:42,916
It's treason.

853
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,208
- I'll tell my brother.
- Tell him what, exactly?

854
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:52,083
That his strong, opinionated queen,
gods rest her soul,

855
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,333
went a little rogue
in the secret meetings,

856
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,666
and deserved to be assassinated?

857
00:45:58,166 --> 00:45:59,333
On your watch?

858
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:01,833
- He trusted you.
- Trusts.

859
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,208
He trusts me.

860
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:08,875
Now more than ever.

861
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:12,333
I am his most important advisor.

862
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:17,625
Whereas you are
a weak, silly, ineffectual little shit

863
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,416
who just delivered his wife's head
to him in a box.

864
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,583
Well, now I come to think of it,

865
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:26,333
how do we know
you weren't involved in her treachery?

866
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,625
You want to help?
Go back to sucking on the royal teat

867
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:36,041
until you're just drunk enough
to forget this terrible tragedy.

868
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:38,791
And keep your mouth shut.

869
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,833
[whispers] Because next time,
it could be your head in a box.

870
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:49,541
[dramatic music]

871
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:04,666
[echoing sighs]

872
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,375
[romantic music]

873
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:19,541
[groaning]

874
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:24,541
Breathe.

875
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:27,541
Breathe.

876
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:38,416
- [screams]
- [echoing gasps]

877
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:46,500
Mmm.

878
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:51,791
Enough.

879
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:52,875
[laughs]

880
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:55,250
[groans]

881
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,333
Aah! [laughing]

882
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:02,666
Oh, I wish you were there today.

883
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:05,916
I mean, I knew Hedwig had a thick neck,

884
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,708
but gods, that was a workout
to cut through. [chuckles]

885
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:11,250
[Philippa] Mmm.

886
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,708
I wonder what Dijkstra thought
of my <i>piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance.</i>

887
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:18,000
[Philippa] Mmm.

888
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,375
No one ever expects
a head in a box, do they?

889
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:24,083
- [Philippa] It doesn't make any sense.
- Hmm?

890
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:27,416
Emhyr uses mages
for cannon fodder, not emissaries.

891
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:31,916
The woman you saw in the meeting
didn't move her mouth.

892
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,541
Oh, well, it takes all sorts,
I suppose. [chuckles]

893
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:37,833
Unless she was using telepathy.

894
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,666
Hmm.

895
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:43,708
But how did she manage
to portal into the palace

896
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:46,333
and through my protection enchantments?

897
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,708
Maybe because the portal was special?

898
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,916
A portal is a portal.

899
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:56,875
I've seen your portals.

900
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:01,166
[sighs] This wasn't that.

901
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:06,333
This was a swirling black vortex
of fucking unnervingness.

902
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:11,750
The mage backing Rience...

903
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,208
works for Nilfgaard.

904
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:18,666
Fuck me.

905
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,125
[caws]

906
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:25,291
[Rience] The only reason
I fucking agreed to do this job

907
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:28,500
is because you told me
you didn't work for Nilfgaard.

908
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:30,666
[Lydia] <i>I don't. I work for my lord.</i>

909
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,000
- Who works for fucking Nilfgaard!
- [cawing]

910
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:36,958
<i>Oh, Rience, don't get so agitated.
It makes you uglier.</i>

911
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:42,541
<i>As for my lord, working</i> with <i>Nilfgaard
is not the same as working</i> for <i>Nilfgaard.</i>

912
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:45,500
<i>The White Flame is just a means to an end.</i>

913
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:47,791
<i>A small piece of a much bigger puzzle.</i>

914
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:51,208
<i>- Don't worry your hideous little face.</i>
- [crow caws]

915
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:53,958
At least I still have a face.

916
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:58,083
Instead of just the illusion of one.

917
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:03,916
Tell him I'm growing tired
of being kept in the dark.

918
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,708
If he wants me
to go along with his little plan,

919
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,166
I have a demand of my own.

920
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
[Francesca speaking in Elder]

921
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:24,583
- [continues speaking in Elder]
- [creaking and sighing sounds]

922
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,583
[Filavandrel] Hey.

923
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:36,166
You... are exhausted.

924
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:39,416
- You need to eat.
- Not until they do.

925
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:42,875
What news from the scouts?

926
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:46,791
There was a rumor that she was spotted
in Maribor. Nothing came of it.

927
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:49,833
And Gallatin?

928
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:53,333
He's headed to Xin'trea
with the roundy general.

929
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:56,875
So perhaps it would be wise to consider

930
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,000
an escape plan.

931
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,041
The only escape I'll take
is death, Filavandrel.

932
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:06,458
[knocking at door]

933
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:13,458
I don't miss the snobbery of the city,
but shit, I do miss the services.

934
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:16,166
[sighs] Your White Flame
sure knows how to host.

935
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,875
- [door slams]
- Well...

936
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,791
I suppose it's not hard

937
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:22,333
to impress a backwards pointy
like you, though, is it?

938
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:25,000
I'd rather be a backwards pointy
invited to the palace

939
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,791
than the rich little shit
who got kicked out of it.

940
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:31,833
That's not fair. I lost my money
long before I was kicked out.

941
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,125
My father was the nobleman.

942
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:41,458
He expected me to have a disposition
of a diplomat like my brothers.

943
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:45,250
But I was impetuous.
Short temper, rash judgment.

944
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:48,083
- That's why I like fighting.
- [scoffs] You? No.

945
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:53,500
Well, if we've moved onto the emotional
story-swapping part of our friendship,

946
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:56,125
I think we'd have got on as kids.

947
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:59,791
We may have burned down a town
or two on accident, but... still.

948
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:10,541
When the Usurper took Nilfgaard,
he enslaved my father and my brothers.

949
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:15,125
He was afraid of their strength and their
ability to someday take revenge, but...

950
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:16,958
but I was...

951
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:19,958
I was just a little boy, I was...

952
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,500
too weak for concern.

953
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:24,375
I was left to starve or die.

954
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:27,416
Cahir, I've known you to march into battle

955
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,666
with little more than a breastplate made
of chicken bones and a stick for a sword.

956
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,666
Fuck the Usurper. He was an idiot.

957
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,375
That's what the White Flame said to me
when he came to free me.

958
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:42,083
"The Usurper was a fool
to let you go, son,

959
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:44,708
because you are the strongest
of them all."

960
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:47,166
Well, I suppose you're strong
for a scrawny little...

961
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,875
[mournful music]

962
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:54,041
[choking]

963
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:05,458
[Cahir] I'm sorry.

964
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:08,500
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

965
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,583
[sobbing]

966
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,875
[wind whistling]

967
00:53:19,416 --> 00:53:21,416
[sighing sounds]

968
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,291
[Cahir groans]

971
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:52,666
[neighs]

972
00:53:54,708 --> 00:53:56,708
[dramatic music]

973
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,416
[thunder crashing]

974
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,125
[thunder booming]

975
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:17,916
[frightened neighing]

976
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:24,125
[whispering voice] <i>Ciri...</i>

[hooves thundering]

[Eredin] <i>Cirilla!</i>

981
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:40,083
<i>Cirilla!</i>

982
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:44,642
- [deep voice] <i>Cirilla!</i>
- [neighing]

983
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:47,416
[Eredin] <i>Cirilla!</i>

984
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,375
No. You're ghosts. Corpses.

985
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:59,791
<i>Yes, we are corpses,
but you are death itself!</i>

986
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,625
<i>Join us.</i>

987
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,666
[yells]

[roaring]

990
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:27,875
You found me.

991
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:36,250
[foreboding music]

992
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:56,833
They were real.
