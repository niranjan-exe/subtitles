1
00:00:12,958 --> 00:00:14,375
[chirping]

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,666
[Jaskier] Vespula? Vespula!

3
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,166
Are you even listening?

4
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,666
What does Radovid even mean, I see people?

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,083
How does he know what I see?
I mean, he's only met me, like, twice.

6
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,958
[traders shouting outside]

7
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:35,166
Nah... You can't play a player.
That's what I always say.

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:39,666
He's hiding something,
and if I'm gonna help Geralt,

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,375
I need to find out what that is.

10
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,708
Because Geralt is...

11
00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:50,250
a hammer.

12
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,750
- [cockerel crows]
- You know?

13
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:54,958
[hooves clattering]

14
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:56,625
You're confused.

15
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,958
All right... Wait... Okay. Ah...

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,625
When you're a hammer,
every problem is a nail.

17
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:05,666
You see a nail
and you're like, "Grrr. Fuck this nail."

18
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,500
"Fuck this nail, in particular."
And you hammer the nail.

19
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,333
But sometimes
the problem is something else.

20
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:14,000
Sometimes the problem is, uh...
a bunch of petunias,

21
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:18,375
or a bowl of... porridge,
and you can't hammer a bowl of porridge.

22
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:22,333
I mean, you can try,
but then your hammer gets all gunked up,

23
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:25,958
porridge goes everywhere,
and then you have... no porridge.

24
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,750
The solution requires

25
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,458
a different kind of tool.

26
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:37,416
And Radovid... is that tool.

27
00:01:38,125 --> 00:01:41,958
Radovid is... a spoon.

28
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:46,000
- Oh, obviously.
- Obviously. Yeah.

29
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,666
Aah... Yeah, I'm aware
this doesn't make a lot of sense.

30
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,333
What I'm trying to say is,
the problem is different.

31
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,333
The solution needs to be different.

32
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,833
And Radovid... is different.

33
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:07,708
He's intelligent.
He tries to hide it, but he's insightful.

34
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,666
Sharp... like a knife.

35
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:16,250
If he's a knife,
I need to keep him away from Geralt.

36
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,458
[Vespula] You like him!

37
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,125
Who, Geralt? Yeah, I guess.

38
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:25,958
Platonically, and occasionally with
great effort, as one would a family goat.

39
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:29,125
- Hang on, when did you get dressed?
- I mean the spoon guy.

40
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:31,166
What, Radovid? No!

41
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,250
- [Vespula] Yes.
- No!

42
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,791
I've cursed you
for chasing tail of every kind.

43
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,958
Men, women, dwarves,

44
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,750
elves, polymorphous...

45
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:43,041
That was one time and I... regret nothing.

46
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:44,333
- It was amazing.
- Hmm.

47
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:48,041
But never have I ever
seen you have a crush.

48
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,708
[playful music]

49
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,166
- A crush?
- Mmm.

50
00:02:52,125 --> 00:02:53,583
Oh, you think I have crushes.

51
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:54,750
Mmm-hmm.

52
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,208
- Crushes are for children, my darling.
- Mmm?

53
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,458
[Vespula gasps]

54
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:02,458
- [Jaskier] I have mind-bending...
- Mmm?

55
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,958
...world-ending,

56
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,166
heart-wrenching affairs.

57
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,166
- Whatever you say.
- [laughs]

58
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,208
- The Lothario of Lyria.
- Oh!

59
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,166
- The Romancer of Redania!
- Aah!

60
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,166
- The Stud of Cidaris!
- [laughs]

61
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,875
- [banging on door]
- [Geralt] Jaskier.

62
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:25,625
For fuck's...

63
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,958
Sorry. It's the family goat.

64
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,250
[Jaskier] Good to see you too.
How'd it go?

65
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,916
[Geralt] Not quite as expected.

66
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,875
[Jaskier] Did you find the castle?

67
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,000
Please tell me you killed Firefingers.

68
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,500
- [horse neighs]
- [Geralt] Rience wasn't there.

69
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,416
I did find something else, though.

70
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,166
Yeah, and what's that?

71
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,083
[girl talking]

72
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,500
- [Geralt] Her.
- [murmuring]

73
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,000
[Jaskier] And she is?

74
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,583
I don't know.

75
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,666
[girl] Ooh, ooh... ooh!

76
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,250
But she thinks she's Ciri.

77
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:58,541
[girl] Always a source. No room for...

78
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,166
I hate you. Ooh!

79
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,250
[Geralt] It's all right... Ciri.

80
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,541
- This is a friend.
- [muttering]

81
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,416
I'm Jaskier.

82
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,208
[girl] Always a source.
No room for vermin.

83
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,333
- Always.
- Fuck. Is she all right?

84
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:15,291
She was part of an experiment.

85
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,083
- [girl] Don't be...
- The only survivor.

86
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,375
[whimpering]

87
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:21,916
She has lucid moments,
but reverts back to this.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,083
[singing]

89
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,958
Whatever she's rambling about,

90
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,041
it's stuck in her head
in a nonsensical loop.

91
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:30,250
I need to find out why.

92
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,500
[Jaskier] Please tell me you have a plan.

93
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,583
[Geralt] We're taking her to Anika.

94
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,875
If this is an enchantment,
she'll be able to fix it.

95
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:40,125
And who's Anika?

96
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:45,208
She's a druid.
And a friend of my mother's.

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
[girl chuckling softly]

98
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,041
[dramatic music]

99
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,500
- [man] Yep, it's him all right.
- [Roach snorts]

100
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:13,791
Smelled you from two hilltops away.

101
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,416
What are you doing here, Otto?

102
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,791
Blame the heightened senses,
but we both know you're a ripe old bugger.

103
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,083
I suppose you're here for a reason.

104
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,583
[girl murmuring]

105
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,583
- [Geralt] Hello, Anika.
- [girl] Wait. Just...

106
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,750
- [Otto] She's missed you too.
- [sighs]

107
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,250
Come on.

108
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,416
[rustling]

109
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,750
- [clattering]
- [Jaskier] Whew! Oh, that burns.

110
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,750
That burns like a Raróg's arsehole.

111
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,791
- [chuckles] What is it?
- [Otto] Uh, that's table salt.

112
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,708
[Jaskier coughing] Yeah.

113
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,125
Ooh-hoo.

114
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,791
Yep, that's just, uh...
that's just table salt.

115
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:59,250
That's not, um... not very druidic.

116
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,541
- I'm not a druid.
- Oh, right.

117
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:02,541
I'm a werewolf.

118
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:05,041
Whoa. What? You're... What? Uh, a...

119
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:08,708
[chuckles] I was bit,
back in the plague of '21.

120
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:12,291
Went out to the woods to isolate.
Avoid the disease.

121
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:14,958
Was so worried about boils
and shitting myself to death,

122
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,666
I wasn't thinking about werewolves.

123
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,041
Priority, yeah. I get it.

124
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,750
Geralt was hired by the villagers
to kill me.

125
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,833
He found me a cure instead.

126
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,625
- Kept close to my chest, it keeps me safe.
- Oh.

127
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:29,666
Almost got himself killed
in the process, but...

128
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:32,250
he saved my life.

129
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:35,875
Yeah. Seems about right.

130
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,958
[girl murmuring softly]

131
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,041
I don't know...

132
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,125
How'd you and Otto meet?

133
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,291
It was about a year ago.

134
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,666
We were at the Temple of Truth. Mourning.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,333
His wife, Edwina, was killed in a fire.
The children too.

136
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,166
I was there for Visenna.

137
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,041
She's dead?

138
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,333
She talked about you a lot at the end.

139
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,666
[mournful music]

140
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,541
Well, whoever did this
fucked her up pretty good.

141
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,625
It's a mind-control enchantment.

142
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,833
[Geralt] Mind control?

143
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,125
So someone needs her
to believe she's Ciri.

144
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,833
It's extremely powerful.

145
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,125
Elements of Chaos, druidic magic,

146
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,583
even some ancient elven sorcery
in the spell.

147
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,833
Oh, that's another thing.
She's part elven.

148
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:46,541
Maybe a couple
of generations removed, but still.

149
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,333
Poor girl's head's a tangled mess.

150
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:52,208
Who would have the power to do this?

151
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,916
I don't know anyone
with the knowledge to do this.

152
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,541
It would take lifetimes
to acquire all these tricks.

153
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,958
Whoever this mage is,
they have quite a variety of interests.

154
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,000
[Otto] An extraction elixir.

155
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,250
[Anika] Well done, Otto.

156
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,458
[uncorks bottle]

157
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,208

00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,791

159

[winces]

Ah, it'll take a while,
and there's no guarantee.

163
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,958
If it works, she'll be able
to tell us who did this.

164
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,958
[Geralt] And what they want with Ciri.

165
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:37,833
[dramatic music]

166

[seabirds calling]

167
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,916
- [bell tinkles]
- [Ciri] This is the dwarven bank.

168
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,875
- I thought we were going to Aretuza.
- [Yennefer] We are.

169
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,250
But as you said yourself,
there's always more to the picture.

170
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,958
- Aah! [laughs]
- [dwarf] My eyes deceive me!

171
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:59,541
For surely,
a creature this beautiful cannot be real!

172
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,541
My sweet Yennefer,

173
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:06,583
it is the most sumptuous of pleasures,
as always.

174
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,875
- The pleasure is all mine, Giancardi.
- Mmm!

175
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,250
Please, take a seat
while we finalize your arrangements.

176
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:18,458
[Giancardi] Horror!
Pure 'orror on my family's faces,

177
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,375
as they watched me
dragged away to certain death,

178
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,833
their own fate hanging in the balance.

179
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,541
When who should appear?
A goddess from the heaven?

180
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,666
- Better! Yennefer of Vengerberg.
- [Yennefer giggles]

181
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,125
She blasted the villainous wretches
into dust.

182
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,000
You exaggerate my heroism.

183
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,250
[Giancardi] Nonsense.

184
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,416
This is why the Giancardi Bank,
mind well the name,

185
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,583
will do anything for a friend.

186
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:47,625
For your other matter,

187
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,541
my most secure vault is yours.

188
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,625
Thank you.

189
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,416
If it's not too much to ask,
I have one more favor.

190
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,041
- [Giancardi] Sure.
- My ward needs a chaperone.

191
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,666
- Say no more.
- [Ciri] What?

192
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,875
Fabio is at your disposal.

193
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,166
I thought you said
this was important for my future.

194
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,500
It is. But first, my past must be settled.

195
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,250
I know you're nervous.
Let me be there with you.

196
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,750
[whimsical music]

197
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,625
There.

198
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,625
Now you look ordinary.

199
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,750
Stop that.

200
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:36,333
No one is after you here.
You're just a normal girl having fun.

201
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,750
Take this. Buy something nice.

202
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,875
Now, let me see that talisman
you're constantly fiddling with.

203
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,666
- [speaking in Elder]
- [shimmering sound]

204
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,250
What's that for?

205
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,083
A locator spell.

206
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,416
If you get into any trouble,
hold this tight and recite the chant.

207
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,833
But don't get into any trouble.

208

- [Vizimir growls]

213
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,166
Your Highness, uh...

214
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,333
there seems to be
some confusion among your advisors.

215
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:28,583
- [clang]
- [Vizimir] Yes!

[man groans]

217
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,458
- Did you see that?
- Yes, very good.

218
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,500
Whispers of a meeting
with an emissary from Nilfgaard?

219
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,625
Oh, that. Yes.

220
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,041
- We brokered a deal.
- [laughs]

221
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:44,041
Quite a good one. In the inevitable event
of their push North,

222
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,500
Nilfgaard has agreed
to leave Redania untouched.

223
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,791
And they're offering
half of Temeria as a vassal state.

224
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,875
Oh, pray tell, my lord, what's the return
on this generous Nilfgaardian investment?

225
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:56,916
Oh, nothing we can't afford.

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,875
"We"?

227
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,166
- [clang]
- [man groans]

228
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,958
And, should we find her first, we turn
the Princess of Cintra over to them.

229
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,375
You are being conned!

230
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:10,666
With all due respect, sir,
Nilfgaard are playing you for a fool.

231
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,458
With all due respect, Dijkstra,

232
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,083
you provide the intelligence,
I make the decisions.

[man groans]

237
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,625
Queen Hedwig sent me to see

238
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,333
if you're finished with the, uh...
important affairs of state?

239
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:31,791
She said to tell you they're here.
In case you wanted to say, uh... hello.

240
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,375
Oh, yes. Quite finished.

241
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,500
But you've still got two more serves.

242
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,958
It can wait. My sweet Hedwig can't.

243
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:42,458
Sire, as your most senior advisor,
I cannot stress enough that...

244
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,291
[Vizimir] You stress too much.

245
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:49,333
The only reason you have any power here,
Sigismund, is because of me.

246
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:51,166
Don't forget that.

247
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,375
[chuckles]

248
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,375
[door slams]

249
00:12:57,458 --> 00:13:00,291
He doesn't take a shit
without me knowing about it.

250
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:03,208
No one gets a private audience with him
outside my purview.

251
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:07,083
Radovid told us they did. He was right.
And they're doing it again.

252
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,541
Vizimir's not scheming alone.

253
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:13,500
Queen Hedwig has been
in such a useful mood of late.

254
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:16,250
Perhaps it's time
to make her useful to us.

255
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,541
Or should I do it?

256
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,250
No. You have enough fires to fight.

257
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,500
Hmm.

258
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,208
Speaking of fires, annoyingly,
I met another dead end

259
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,416
through that portal in the shape
of an artsy-fartsy crafting studio.

260
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,833
Apparently, Rience is being backed
by someone with appalling taste.

261
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:35,583
I meant the portal itself.
You said it felt different. More powerful.

262
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,541
Perhaps it's time
to reach out to one of your old community.

263
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,750
- Tissaia might be useful.
- Ooh...

264
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:46,291
I only mean
that if what the bard says is true,

265
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,708
the witcher is on our scent.

266
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,708
If he gets to Rience first,
we lose the girl.

267
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,250
And our leverage.

268
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,375
Which is why we must both act now.

269
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,416
You know as well as I do, there are
many ways to persuade the stubborn.

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,041
Use Radovid.
Time for him to cut his teeth.

271
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,458
[Radovid] Yes, Dijkstra.

272
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,166
Use me.

273
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,791
Shall I, uh... chat with kitchen hands?

274
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,833
Uh, watch for shady carriages rolling up?

275
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,875
Shadow my brother's wife?

276
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:22,333
You seem nowhere close
to finding this powerful Princess Cirilla.

277
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,458
You're just so busy
with your royal duties,

278
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,208
I dare not split your focus.

279
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,750
I don't need your help.

280
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,750
Well, tell that to your king.

281
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,541
And your boss.

00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,250
[door grinding]

00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:47,875
[Yennefer] You came.

- [coins shuffling]
- [door clangs shut]

285
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,208
Strange, isn't it?

286
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,500
Men bleed and kill for this stuff.

287
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,416
Only to let it rust.

288
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,166
In dark rooms.

289
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,750
[Yennefer] Because it's worthless.

290
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,291
It's too soft to make anything useful.

291
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,375
You can't eat it. Can't fuck it.

292
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,208
Though the King of Aedirn
used to like to try.

293
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:13,875
Its power comes
from believing in its value.

294
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,250
An illusion designed
to control the masses.

295
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,500
The leader of the Brotherhood
should know all about that.

296
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,291
She seems to know everything else.

297
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,458
You know, it started
to gnaw at me, back in Ellander.

298
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,625
Northerners killing their own.

299
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,875
[melancholy music]

300
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:35,458
The whispers of a dozen bounties
on Cirilla of Cintra.

301
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:38,541
When last everyone knew,
she was killed in the slaughter.

302
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:43,875
I think you learned Cirilla was alive
and shared the news,

303
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:46,250
hoping to curry favor
with the Northern kings.

304
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:51,583
Except no one can find her.
The Brotherhood is on their shit list,

305
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:54,500
and they're so focused
on terrorizing an orphan

306
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:57,583
that they can't see an empire
waiting to destroy them.

307
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:02,333
Curry favor?

308
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,916
I don't know what's more insulting.

309
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:08,083
That you think my goals so basic,

310
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:11,083
or that you free
a Nilfgaardian prisoner of war,

311
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:12,916
then lecture me on Northern unity.

312
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,625
What mess will you
leave us with this time?

313
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,666
I have been a mess.

314
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And I'm sorry.

315
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,875
When I tried to kill myself at Aretuza,
I was so desperate to control my destiny.

316
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:33,000
You weren't taking control.
You were losing it.

317
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,083
I know.

318
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,583
And I still feel like that sometimes.

319
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,041
Like I'm at a loss.

320
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,291
Rience. A fire mage.

321
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:47,291
He's after Cirilla too, but someone
far more powerful is backing him.

322
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,458
We can't let him get to her.

323
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:56,875
You want me to help hide a princess
whose existence means war?

324
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,375
I want more than that.

325
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,875
She's extraordinary.

326
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:05,541
She's the rightful heir to Cintra
and a great deal more, so I'm told.

327
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:08,041
If war is coming,
there is no hiding her from it.

328
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:10,416
Well, then, maybe
she can lead us out of it.

For all the Brotherhood's faults,

She deserves to know
what hers is capable of.

331
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,500
She deserves control of her destiny.

Please.

After all your searching,
you actually did it.

Thanedd Island.

That's the Tower of the Gull. Tor Lara.

Looks scary, doesn't it?

357

Legend has it, they take failing novices

Her choices are
in defiance of your orders, sir.

You failed.

My lord, I have been in the field.
Gallatin is a good fighter.

00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:31,291
He knows the land.
The elves are loyal to him.

430
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,041
He can deliver us the North.

431
00:22:37,666 --> 00:22:40,916
Division among the elves
would only hurt our cause on both fronts.

I know a good leader when I see one.

It gave me... no pleasure to punish you.

436
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:07,916
But I had to know you could be trusted.

find Rience and the mage that did this,
and kill them.

And then what?

447
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:06,541
Yarpen told me he saw you
talking to Philippa Eilhart in Ban Gleán.

448

It's okay, Jaskier.

What did Dijkstra want you to do?

450
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:16,583
He wanted me to convince you

451
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,125
to take Ciri to Redania.

[chuckles]

453
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,708
And I agree with him.

454
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:27,500
She'd be safe with an army,
an entire army at her back.

455
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:31,250
Ciri would be nothing more
than a brood mare on the Cintran throne.

456
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:33,250
She's a princess, Geralt.

457
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:35,083
That's what princesses do.

458
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:38,458
They sit on little royal thrones
and they have little royal babies.

459
00:24:38,541 --> 00:24:41,625
And they rule kingdoms.
This is what Ciri wants.

460
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:45,125
Does she want to be a political pawn
for Vizimir and Dijkstra?

461
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:46,333
- No...
- No.

462
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,333
We stay the course.

463
00:24:48,416 --> 00:24:49,875
Neutrality has consequences too.

464
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:54,291
There are already consequences, Jaskier.
And not just for Ciri.

465
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:58,375
I thought by taking her off the board,
the world would stop trying to use her.

466
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,375
Instead, they're trying
to use others in her place.

467
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,000
And they will continue to.

468
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:07,333
Because that is what people in power do.

469
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,500
But she's not a witcher.

470
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:16,875
She's certainly not an Aretuzan witch
sourcing magic out of... stones, or hemp,

471
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:20,166
or plants,
or whatever it is that Yennefer does.

472
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,041
She's a princess.

473
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,625
I think you should trust her.

474
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,083
Her source.

475
00:25:29,333 --> 00:25:30,583
Her... what now?

476
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:34,375
You're right.

477
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,666
[Jaskier] I'm right...

478
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:42,916
Well, that's deeply worrying. What?

479
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:49,041
[Anika] Geralt...

480
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,250
- I need you to wake up.
- [Anika] Geralt, no.

481
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:52,892
- [Otto] It's too soon.
- Can you hear me?

482
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:54,596
[Otto] You could hurt
the extraction spell.

483
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,250
You said there was always a source.

484
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,208
- [sighs]
- [Geralt] What did you mean?

485
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,208
Always a source to what?

486
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,458
Magic.

487
00:26:05,333 --> 00:26:07,083
[Geralt] Can you tell me your name?

488
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:09,375
Teryn.

489
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,041
[Geralt] Good.

490
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:13,291
Something happened
that affected your mind.

491
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,833
Do you remember what happened?

492
00:26:19,625 --> 00:26:20,625
[gasps]

493
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,500
I was dragged from my room.

494
00:26:22,583 --> 00:26:23,583
Yes.

495
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:25,791
By a man.

496
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:27,541
A man with a scar?

497
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:28,875
[Anika] Careful, Geralt.

498
00:26:28,958 --> 00:26:31,958
[Teryn, shakily] He was there. Sometimes.

499
00:26:34,791 --> 00:26:37,833
And the woman with the funny voice.

500
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:40,791
They all helped the man.

501
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,125
The man, he...

502
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:47,208
He always scared me.

503
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:49,375
You knew him.

504
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,666
At school.

505
00:26:53,166 --> 00:26:54,541
At Aretuza.

506
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,166
[gasps]

507
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:59,791
Oh... [sobbing]

508
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:01,375
We need to put her back under.

509
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:03,498
- [Geralt] I need a name.
- [Otto] I'll grab elixir.

510
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:04,833
- [wailing]
- It's all right.

511
00:27:04,916 --> 00:27:06,708
- Just say it.
- What was his name, Teryn?

512
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,791
[screaming]

513
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:11,500
[wails]

514
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,041
[sobs]

515
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,625
[deep voice] Stupid witcher.

516
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,833
You're doomed and you don't even know it.

517
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,041
[overlapping voices]
I am Cirilla's destiny.

518
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:27,250
May all ye wail,

519
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:31,041
for the Destroyer of Nations is upon us.

520
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,250
[yelps]

521
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:37,041
Anika!

522
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,916
- [cracking sounds]
- [groaning]

523
00:27:41,875 --> 00:27:42,750
[crunching]

524
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:44,500
[deep voice] Geralt!

525
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,375
- [growling]
- Jaskier, the amulet!

526
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,791
No, no, no, no. Teryn. Teryn!

527
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,958
- Jaskier!
- [roaring]

528
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:53,333
- [grunting]
- Geralt!

529
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,791
[Otto] Ah! Aah...

530
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,541
- [Teryn gasping]
- [Jaskier] Shh, shh.

531
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:04,291
- [Otto sighing]
- [Teryn whimpering]

532
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,958
[Jaskier] Shh, shh.

533
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,416
[barker] Roll up! Roll up!

534
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,250
Roll up!

535
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:18,791
See with your own eyes

536
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:22,250
the most frightful creature
the gods ever created!

537
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:27,208
A live basilisk, the venomous terror
of the Zerrikanian desert!

538
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,750
An insatiable man-eater!

539
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,291
- Only 15 groats.
- Told you.

540
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:33,666
[barker] That's 15 groats, yeah?
Hey, you, hop it.

541
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,708
15 groats, everyone. Yeah, go on.
Pay the money to the boy.

542
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:38,666
In you go. Enjoy. In you go.

543
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,583
Enjoy the show.
[chuckles] Enjoy the show.

544
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:44,458
[barker continues shouting]

545
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,750
[man] Come on, hurry up!

546
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:51,708
Careful. These beasts
are notoriously unpredictable.

547
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:53,583
I've fought enough of them to know.

548
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,625
[woman] Hey, let's get to the front.

549
00:28:58,208 --> 00:28:59,416
[growling]

550
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,125
- [Ciri] That cage looks small.
- Maybe it's a baby basilisk.

551
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:05,708
That would be a rip-off.
How scary could that be?

552
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:08,083
You'd be surprised.

553
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,458
They are unpredictable.

554
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,333
And unpredictable means trouble.

555
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,250
What's wrong with a little trouble?

556
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,625
[scoffs] A lot if you've lived my life.

557
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,916
That sounds like a challenge.

558
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,541
[soft clink]

559
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,250
[growling continues]

560
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:30,958
Ladies and gentlemen!

561
00:29:31,041 --> 00:29:32,791
[laughing]

562
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,333
The king of all serpents.

563
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:37,833
'Tis a most rare monster.

564
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,083
- [thump]
- [squealing]

565
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:44,000
Hatching from an egg
only laid by a knavish cockerel, well!

566
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,666
Who presents his rump to another...

567
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:50,041
in the manner of a horny hen!

568
00:29:50,125 --> 00:29:51,750
- Ooooh!
- [laughter]

569
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,291
Cock-a-doodle-doo-ooh-ooh!

570
00:29:55,916 --> 00:29:57,041
Ta-da!

571
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,041
[crowd gasps]

572
00:29:58,125 --> 00:30:00,166
An egg that must be brooded

573
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,833
by a hundred and one venomous snakes.

574
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,166
[growling]

575
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,375
Good people, keep your distance.

576
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:11,416
Its breath alone could poison you.

577
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,083
- [Ciri] That's not a basilisk.
- [gasps and murmurs]

578
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,708
[man] Stop interrupting, love.

579
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:19,458
When the basilisk hatches,

580
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:22,333
it devours the snakes,
imbibing their venom.

581
00:30:22,416 --> 00:30:25,125
And when a knight stabs it with his sword,

582
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,625
the poison runs up the blade,
killing the knight...

583
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,708
- Chhkk, chhkk! Outright.
- [crowd gasps]

584
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:31,250
That is the falsest lie.

585
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,833
'Tis the truest truth.

586
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:37,250
That's why a basilisk can only be killed
by seeing its reflection in the mirror.

587
00:30:37,333 --> 00:30:38,791
Quite right, sir!

588
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:41,416
- Don't.
- No, you're all wrong. This is a wyvern.

589
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,208
And it's young, and it's starving
because you're keeping it in this cage!

590
00:30:45,916 --> 00:30:47,041
[laughs mockingly]

591
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,583
Listen, darlin',
if you don't like my little show,

592
00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:52,166
why don't you just piss off and shut up?

593
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:56,208
- [wyvern squeals]
- [barker groans]

[wyvern squealing]

Oi, oi, you little shit!

603
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,708
This girl is under the protection
of Giancardi Bank.

604
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:40,500
Mind well the name, arsehole.

Here!

[woman] Who is she? Is she okay?

613
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,625
- [Ciri groans]
- [knight] Get off of her, devil dog!

614
00:32:12,416 --> 00:32:14,250
You saved me, brave knight!

615
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:16,375
We have a hero in our midst!

616
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:18,250
- He saved us all!
- [knight] I did?

617
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,208
- I did!
- [Ciri] I have to get out of here!

618
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:25,166
[Fabio] That was fucking incredible!
Did you see me hit that guy?

619
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,930
- [Ciri] Yennefer will kill me.
- I'll get fired, I don't even care!

620
00:32:27,958 --> 00:32:29,791
- Where the fuck's my money?
- I can travel.

621
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:32,355
- Kick arse through this fucking Continent!
- Where's my money?

You were great in there.

625
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,333
Fucking hell.

626
00:32:44,791 --> 00:32:46,375
I've gotta go. Thank you.

627
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:49,708
- Where are you goin'?
- And good luck kicking arse!

00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:16,375
- Back to the dorms.
- Get your hands off me!

636
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:17,958
[gasps]

637
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:20,333
You will address me
as Mistress Laux-Antille.

638
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,833
And you'll clean the toilets
for your impertinence.

639
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,276
[Yennefer] I'll take it from here.

640
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,833
[Mistress Laux-Antille] Yen.

641
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,750
[Sabrina] What are you doing here?

642
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:31,291
Bringing my ward
to get a proper education,

643
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,333
one she obviously sorely needs.

644
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,083
Forgive her, Rita.

645
00:33:40,208 --> 00:33:41,500
So this is the girl.

646
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:46,708
Don't look at her.

647
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,333
Look at me.

648
00:33:53,833 --> 00:33:56,208
Don't you dare take your eyes off me.

649
00:33:57,541 --> 00:33:59,541
[low rumbling]

650
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:06,646
- [Yennefer] That's enough introductions.
- [breathing shakily]

651
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:11,583
As an apology for her impudence, allow me
to treat you ladies to some luxury.

652
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:13,541
[Sabrina] Thank gods, I'm bored.

653
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,833
Shall we take the waters
at the Silver Heron?

654
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:16,833
[both giggle]

655
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:19,041
[Rita] Don't threaten me with a good time.

656
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,166
[gasps]

657
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:23,916
[sighs]

658
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:26,541
[echoing laughter]

659
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,416
[Rita chuckles] Hands off. He's mine.

660
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:36,416
[Sabrina] I wasn't planning
on using my hands.

661
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:44,000
[Rita] Fuck magic, let's stay here.

662
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:52,208
[Sabrina] If this place ever closes,
I'll burn this fucking city to the ground.

663
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,291
Here, girl!

664
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,708
Novices these days are useless.

665
00:34:58,791 --> 00:35:01,250
- [Sabrina] Mmm.
- [Rita] Not like when we were girls.

666
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:04,500
I told you to bring the wine.

667
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:07,083
I'm surprised you can taste anything
at this point.

668
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:09,166
Are you calling me a lush?

669
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,541
Better a lush than a traitor.

670
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:15,166
Tell me, Yennefer.

671
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,416
Are the rumors about witchers true?

672
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,166
That their mutations make them impotent?

673
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,625
- [Rita] You're fucking a witcher? [laughs]
- [Sabrina] Atrocious, isn't it?

674
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:28,041
- Almost as atrocious as your manners.
- Mmm.

675
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,625
- [Rita] Ooh.
- [Sabrina giggles]

676
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:33,791
Perhaps instead of dwelling on the past,
focus our attention on the future.

677
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,333
I wanted red!

678
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:37,541
[Sabrina] Here.

679
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:39,416
We deserve a drink.

680
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:42,875
After all the fires
we've been putting out between kingdoms.

681
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,916
Fires we didn't start.

682
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:50,416
[Rita] Damned Cintran princess.

683
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,125
- What's so special about her, anyway?
- [Sabrina] Mmm.

684
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:57,375
Girl, the wine! Now.

685
00:35:58,416 --> 00:35:59,416
Get it yourself.

686
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,541
[bangs pitcher down]

687
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:05,875
[laughs]

688
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:07,333
She'll only screw it up.

689
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:10,041
Besides, I know where the good stuff is.

690
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,583
[gasps]

691
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:18,750
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Shut the fuck up.

692
00:36:18,833 --> 00:36:22,458
- Before you spoil everything.
- I can't spoil something already rotten!

693
00:36:22,541 --> 00:36:24,958
This place, these women, it's horrible!

694
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:27,625
"This place"? You're not a princess here.

695
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,750
You're a low-level novice.
Get used to being treated like one.

696
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,875
Entitlement will get you nowhere.

697
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,375
[breathing heavily]
I don't want to do this.

698
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:37,598
You know, I don't want to do this either.

699
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:40,666
Tomorrow I'll be expected
to crawl back to the Brotherhood,

700
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,125
tail between my legs,
begging for forgiveness.

701
00:36:43,208 --> 00:36:44,500
And I'll do it.

702
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:48,625
Because Aretuza is my best hope
of protecting you from those who hunt you.

703
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:50,958
<i>Our </i>best chance to be safe.

704
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:54,541
- You have to go along to get along.
- To what end?

705
00:36:55,208 --> 00:36:59,208
If I can't learn to control my powers,
will you let Tissaia turn me into an eel?

706
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:02,291
And if I do become
some powerful, learned Aretuzan maid,

707
00:37:02,375 --> 00:37:04,125
will you let her scrape out my insides

708
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:07,083
to become vapid and power-hungry
like your friends out there?

709
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:10,500
Tissaia is one of the most
powerful sorceresses on this Continent!

710
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:13,041
You should be grateful
she's willing to teach you!

711
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:14,416
[breathing heavily]

712
00:37:17,166 --> 00:37:19,041
[whispers] Just because she saved you

713
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,875
does not mean
you owe her the rest of your life.

714
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,750
You told me
to never apologize for my power,

715
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:29,166
and yet that's all you seem to do.

716
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:33,666
You want to be a great leader?
You want to change the world?

717
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:35,791
Well, the day-to-day of leading

718
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:38,583
is dealing with a lot of vapid,
power-hungry arseholes!

719
00:37:43,125 --> 00:37:44,291
I'm not Geralt.

720
00:37:45,416 --> 00:37:46,791
This isn't Kaer Morhen.

721
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:50,333
This is the version of myself
I have to be here.

722
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:54,166
So you need to find a version of yourself
that can deal with that.

723
00:37:54,666 --> 00:37:56,500
Trust me, I know you're not Geralt.

724
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,791
- He would never sell his soul like this.
- [sobbing]

725
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,375
- [yells]
- [glass clatters]

726
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:07,958
[sobbing]

727
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,208
[fire crackling]

728
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,583
- [owl hooting]
- [sighs]

729
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:20,625
[gasping]

730
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:23,208
- It's all right.
- [sighs]

731
00:38:25,791 --> 00:38:27,166
Thanks to Otto.

732
00:38:28,791 --> 00:38:31,125
I've never seen
someone make a potion so fast.

733
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:33,333
You taught him well.

734
00:38:34,791 --> 00:38:36,750
[sighs] Just like Visenna taught me.

735
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,375
Did she suffer?

736
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:49,791
She was mistaken for an elf
while helping a villager.

737
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:51,458
[mournful music]

738
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:54,208
She was beaten very badly.

739
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,250
Does that make you feel better or worse?

740
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,083
I never wanted her to hurt.

741
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:09,000
- Just wanted her to know what she did.
- Oh, she knew.

742
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:13,583
Love for a child forces parents to make
the hardest choices of their lives.

743
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:16,083
Impossible ones, even.

744
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:21,166
Chances are, they toil over it
for the rest of their lives.

745
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:32,625
I do remember bits of our life.

746
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,041
She smelled like embers.

747
00:39:40,375 --> 00:39:44,458
From keeping those measly fires alive
for the long nights.

748
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,375
I remember my hunger.

749
00:39:50,666 --> 00:39:53,125
And her stomach growling
twice as loud as mine.

750
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:57,083
She used her magic

751
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,291
to create elaborate meals
that we couldn't afford.

752
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:10,208
I would have done anything
to make her smile.

753
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,375
And yet...

754
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,208
the day she left me,

755
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,291
she was sick.

756
00:40:23,875 --> 00:40:26,125
She needed water,
so I went to get her some.

757
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,000
And when I came back...

758
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:31,666
she was gone.

759
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,375
I called for her.

760
00:40:39,458 --> 00:40:40,458
But she was gone.

761
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,833
She loved you the best she could.

762
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:48,208
To save you, she had to let you go.

763
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:53,541
- This can't have been the only choice.
- It wasn't.

764
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,625
It's simply the one she made.

765
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,416
And now you have
your own impossible decision.

766
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,250
I won't abandon Ciri.

767
00:41:03,625 --> 00:41:05,458
Even if it costs me my life.

768
00:41:06,916 --> 00:41:08,333
[sighs]

769
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:12,041
Teryn.

770
00:41:14,458 --> 00:41:17,541
Can she stay here,
while I work out how to help her?

771
00:41:17,625 --> 00:41:20,208
- Mmm, of course.
- Thank you.

772
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:22,458
Where are you going?

773
00:41:25,041 --> 00:41:26,958
Aretuza. [sighs]

774
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:32,416
[water splashing gently]

775
00:41:35,708 --> 00:41:36,916
[quiet laughter]

776
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,666
Are you all right?

777
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,166
No.

778
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,750
The magic is one thing.

779
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,833
- But the politics...
- Hmm.

780
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:53,875
Even if I can curry enough favor to get
back into the Brotherhood's fold

781
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,666
and get her trained, you're right.

782
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,041
War is coming,
and she's at the center of it.

783
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:02,083
Mages have kept kings in check
for centuries.

784
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:07,541
- We'll find a way.
- Toxicity's infectious.

785
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:13,750
The kings have turned against each other.
How long before mages follow suit?

786
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,916
If we are to unite the North,
we must be united.

787
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,166
[Tissaia chuckles]

788
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:22,875
A conclave.

789
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,041
What?

790
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:28,333
We host a conclave of mages.

791
00:42:29,958 --> 00:42:33,291
- We haven't had one since before Sodden.
- And then we went to war.

792
00:42:33,375 --> 00:42:35,166
So we do it differently this time.

793
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:40,000
Instead of discord and debate,
we focus on trust.

794
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:41,958
Togetherness.

795
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:49,166
Is this also the girl's doing?

796
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:52,875
If we have any hope
of appealing to the kings,

797
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,541
we first have to find
better versions of ourselves.

798
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:00,916
I'm willing to try.

799
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:03,583
Are you?

800
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,208
- [chuckles]
- [laughter downstairs]

801
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:12,625
[wistful music]

802

[dog barking]

803
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,208
[breathing shakily]

804
00:43:23,291 --> 00:43:24,291
[whispers] Geralt.

805
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:26,375
Hey, Geralt, where are you?

806
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:28,958
- [whispering voices]
- Geralt, where are you?

807
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,681
- [wind whistling]
- [voice] <i>Who's Geralt?</i>

808
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,291
- [voices overlapping]
- Where are you?

809
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:34,416
[jumbled voices and laughter]

810
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,625
[voice whispers] <i>He's coming. Now.</i>

811
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,416
[Geralt] <i>We'll meet again soon.</i>

812
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:43,750
[mouth full] I understand your concerns.
But I've made up my mind.

813
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:46,208
This Cirilla nonsense is
too much of a headache.

814
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,916
I couldn't agree more, Your Majesty.

815
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:52,375
But bargaining with Nilfgaard
is not the answer.

816
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:56,625
- The queen is opinionated and strong.
- Like a bull.

817
00:43:56,708 --> 00:44:00,375
And Radovid is eager to please.
But all three of you are far too important

818
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:03,708
to burden yourself with the minutiae
of Redanian intelligence.

819
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:05,708
What would you suggest?

820
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:10,583
Hope I'm not interrupting.
Uh, this was left with my manservant.

821
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:13,750
- The note says it's for you.
- Oh.

822
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:16,333
A present. [chuckles]

823
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:23,000
"Courtesy of Nilfgaard."
See, I told you, Dijkstra.

824
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,375
They're not so ba...

825
00:44:25,875 --> 00:44:27,333
[yelps]

826
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:29,333
[gasps]

827
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:31,166
- [wailing]
- [coughing]

828
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:33,250
[Vizimir sobbing]

829
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:37,250
I want men on every door and window.
Nobody in or out but me!

830
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:39,541
Tell the gatekeeper
to scout the perimeter.

831
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:41,833
Bring me
Radovid's manservant immediately!

832
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:44,000
- [sobbing]
- [guard 1] With me! Now!

833
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:46,500
Man on every door! We've got intruders!

834
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:50,666
[whispers] I swear to you,
I will not let them get away with this.

835
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:52,886
- [men running]
- [guard 1] Guard the gates!

836
00:44:52,958 --> 00:44:54,798
- Come. Come.
- [guard 2] Secure the perimeter!

837
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,791
- Through that gate!
- [guard 3] By me!

838
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,750
- Through there, now!
- Come.

839
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,333
- Take the king to his chambers.
- My lord.

840
00:45:04,458 --> 00:45:06,625
- [distant door slams]
- [guards yelling]

841
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,833
- [sighs]
- [Vizimir sobbing]

842
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,083
[nearby door slams]

843
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,083
[intriguing music]

844
00:45:17,166 --> 00:45:18,208
Hmm.

845
00:45:22,333 --> 00:45:23,916
[Radovid gasps]

846
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,166
Mmm. Hah!

847
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:28,625
You.

848
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,791
All that talk of...
making the queen more useful.

849
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,333
You and Philippa did this.

850
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:40,166
You won't get away with it.

851
00:45:40,666 --> 00:45:41,541
Huh.

852
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:42,916
It's treason.

853
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,208
- I'll tell my brother.
- Tell him what, exactly?

854
00:45:48,791 --> 00:45:52,083
That his strong, opinionated queen,
gods rest her soul,

855
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,333
went a little rogue
in the secret meetings,

856
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,666
and deserved to be assassinated?

857
00:45:58,166 --> 00:45:59,333
On your watch?

858
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:01,833
- He trusted you.
- Trusts.

859
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:06,208
He trusts me.

860
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:08,875
Now more than ever.

861
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:12,333
I am his most important advisor.

862
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:17,625
Whereas you are
a weak, silly, ineffectual little shit

863
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:20,416
who just delivered his wife's head
to him in a box.

864
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,583
Well, now I come to think of it,

865
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:26,333
how do we know
you weren't involved in her treachery?

866
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,625
You want to help?
Go back to sucking on the royal teat

867
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:36,041
until you're just drunk enough
to forget this terrible tragedy.

868
00:46:36,875 --> 00:46:38,791
And keep your mouth shut.

869
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,833
[whispers] Because next time,
it could be your head in a box.

870
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:49,541
[dramatic music]

871
00:47:02,666 --> 00:47:04,666
[echoing sighs]

872
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,375
[romantic music]

873
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:19,541
[groaning]

874
00:47:23,458 --> 00:47:24,541
Breathe.

875
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:27,541
Breathe.

876
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:38,416
- [screams]
- [echoing gasps]

877
00:47:45,458 --> 00:47:46,500
Mmm.

878
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:51,791
Enough.

879
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:52,875
[laughs]

880
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:55,250
[groans]

881
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,333
Aah! [laughing]

882
00:48:00,666 --> 00:48:02,666
Oh, I wish you were there today.

883
00:48:03,916 --> 00:48:05,916
I mean, I knew Hedwig had a thick neck,

884
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,708
but gods, that was a workout
to cut through. [chuckles]

885
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:11,250
[Philippa] Mmm.

886
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,708
I wonder what Dijkstra thought
of my <i>pièce de résistance.</i>

887
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:18,000
[Philippa] Mmm.

888
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,375
No one ever expects
a head in a box, do they?

889
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:24,083
- [Philippa] It doesn't make any sense.
- Hmm?

890
00:48:24,166 --> 00:48:27,416
Emhyr uses mages
for cannon fodder, not emissaries.

891
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:31,916
The woman you saw in the meeting
didn't move her mouth.

892
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,541
Oh, well, it takes all sorts,
I suppose. [chuckles]

893
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:37,833
Unless she was using telepathy.

894
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,666
Hmm.

895
00:48:41,708 --> 00:48:43,708
But how did she manage
to portal into the palace

896
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:46,333
and through my protection enchantments?

897
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:49,708
Maybe because the portal was special?

898
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,916
A portal is a portal.

899
00:48:55,625 --> 00:48:56,875
I've seen your portals.

900
00:48:58,666 --> 00:49:01,166
[sighs] This wasn't that.

901
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:06,333
This was a swirling black vortex
of fucking unnervingness.

902
00:49:09,541 --> 00:49:11,750
The mage backing Rience...

903
00:49:13,708 --> 00:49:15,208
works for Nilfgaard.

904
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:18,666
Fuck me.

905
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,125
[caws]

906
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:25,291
[Rience] The only reason
I fucking agreed to do this job

907
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:28,500
is because you told me
you didn't work for Nilfgaard.

908
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:30,666
[Lydia] <i>I don't. I work for my lord.</i>

909
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,000
- Who works for fucking Nilfgaard!
- [cawing]

910
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:36,958
<i>Oh, Rience, don't get so agitated.
It makes you uglier.</i>

911
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:42,541
<i>As for my lord, working</i> with <i>Nilfgaard
is not the same as working</i> for <i>Nilfgaard.</i>

912
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:45,500
<i>The White Flame is just a means to an end.</i>

913
00:49:45,583 --> 00:49:47,791
<i>A small piece of a much bigger puzzle.</i>

914
00:49:48,666 --> 00:49:51,208
<i>- Don't worry your hideous little face.</i>
- [crow caws]

915
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:53,958
At least I still have a face.

916
00:49:55,791 --> 00:49:58,083
Instead of just the illusion of one.

917
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:03,916
Tell him I'm growing tired
of being kept in the dark.

918
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,708
If he wants me
to go along with his little plan,

919
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:10,166
I have a demand of my own.

920
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
[Francesca speaking in Elder]

921
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:24,583
- [continues speaking in Elder]
- [creaking and sighing sounds]

922
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,583
[Filavandrel] Hey.

923
00:50:33,125 --> 00:50:36,166
You... are exhausted.

924
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:39,416
- You need to eat.
- Not until they do.

925
00:50:41,666 --> 00:50:42,875
What news from the scouts?

926
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:46,791
There was a rumor that she was spotted
in Maribor. Nothing came of it.

927
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:49,833
And Gallatin?

928
00:50:49,916 --> 00:50:53,333
He's headed to Xin'trea
with the roundy general.

929
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:56,875
So perhaps it would be wise to consider

930
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,000
an escape plan.

931
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,041
The only escape I'll take
is death, Filavandrel.

932
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:06,458
[knocking at door]

933
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:13,458
I don't miss the snobbery of the city,
but shit, I do miss the services.

934
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:16,166
[sighs] Your White Flame
sure knows how to host.

935
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:17,875
- [door slams]
- Well...

936
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,791
I suppose it's not hard

937
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:22,333
to impress a backwards pointy
like you, though, is it?

938
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:25,000
I'd rather be a backwards pointy
invited to the palace

939
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:27,791
than the rich little shit
who got kicked out of it.

940
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:31,833
That's not fair. I lost my money
long before I was kicked out.

941
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,125
My father was the nobleman.

942
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:41,458
He expected me to have a disposition
of a diplomat like my brothers.

943
00:51:42,083 --> 00:51:45,250
But I was impetuous.
Short temper, rash judgment.

944
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:48,083
- That's why I like fighting.
- [scoffs] You? No.

945
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:53,500
Well, if we've moved onto the emotional
story-swapping part of our friendship,

946
00:51:54,083 --> 00:51:56,125
I think we'd have got on as kids.

947
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:59,791
We may have burned down a town
or two on accident, but... still.

948
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:10,541
When the Usurper took Nilfgaard,
he enslaved my father and my brothers.

949
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:15,125
He was afraid of their strength and their
ability to someday take revenge, but...

950
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:16,958
but I was...

951
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:19,958
I was just a little boy, I was...

952
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,500
too weak for concern.

953
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:24,375
I was left to starve or die.

954
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:27,416
Cahir, I've known you to march into battle

955
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:31,666
with little more than a breastplate made
of chicken bones and a stick for a sword.

956
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,666
Fuck the Usurper. He was an idiot.

957
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,375
That's what the White Flame said to me
when he came to free me.

958
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:42,083
"The Usurper was a fool
to let you go, son,

959
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:44,708
because you are the strongest
of them all."

960
00:52:44,791 --> 00:52:47,166
Well, I suppose you're strong
for a scrawny little...

961
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,875
[mournful music]

962
00:52:52,666 --> 00:52:54,041
[choking]

963
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:05,458
[Cahir] I'm sorry.

964
00:53:06,041 --> 00:53:08,500
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

965
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,583
[sobbing]

966
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,875

[Eredin] <i>Cirilla!</i>

981
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:40,083
<i>Cirilla!</i>

982
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:44,642
- [deep voice] <i>Cirilla!</i>
- [neighing]

983
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:47,416
[Eredin] <i>Cirilla!</i>

984
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:54,375
No. You're ghosts. Corpses.

985
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:59,791
<i>Yes, we are corpses,
but you are death itself!</i>

986
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:07,625
<i>Join us.</i>

You found me.

[foreboding music]

992
00:55:55,708 --> 00:55:56,833
They were real.
