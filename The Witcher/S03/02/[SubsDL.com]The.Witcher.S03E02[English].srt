1
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:09,166
[man 1] Hang 'em high!

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,958
[crowd cheering]

3
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,041
[man 1] Snap their spindly necks!

4
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,458
- [crowd cheering]
- [woman 1] Yeah! Drop them!

5
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:20,666
[man 2] To the brave boys of Temeria!

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,083
[man 3] Kick those Kaedwenian arses
back to their icy shithole of a state!

7
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,166
[cheering]

8
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,750
[woman 2] Traveled far, friend?

9
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,041
I go where King Demavend sends me.

10
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:34,250
Royal messenger?

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,416
I suppose
you'll be taking my best horse, then?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,250
Well, I'll leave him at the next post.
Under the name of Aplegatt.

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,000
Lame and over-ridden, no doubt.

14
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:49,833
Well, give us a draught of your finest ale
and... I'll add it to the king's bill.

15
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:50,916
Huh.

16
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,541
Seems festive in these parts.

17
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,141
[innkeeper] Hanging's good for business.

18
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,291
That spy was our fourth execution
in as many days.

19
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:04,208
- One Kaedwenian, one Aerdirnian...
- [man 4 whispers] Look at those eyes.

20
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,916
[woman 3] Look at her!

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,875
[innkeeper] See, that's the problem.
What's a mage doing all the way out here?

22
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,833
She should be focusing
on keeping the Royal peace,

23
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,500
not swannin' idly around the countryside.

24
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,791
[chuckling] Looking like that, though,
she can idle around me tonight.

25
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:24,291
You do know that they keep their beauty
by bathin' in human blood every night, eh?

26
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,083
Thanks for the ale.

27
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:28,375
I'll be seein' you.

28
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,791
[Yennefer] Straight to Tissaia.
No portals.

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,625
[woman] Yes, my lady.

30
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:41,041
[laughter and cheering continue]

31
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,083
Cold one, isn't it?

32
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,625
God speed, miss.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,208
I was just... wishin' you a safe journey.

34
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,375
[echoing screams]

35
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,833
- [screaming]
- [horse neighs]

36
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,291
- [thunder crashes]
- [Aplegatt screams]

37
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,541
- [thunder fades]
- [horse snorts]

38
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:14,958
- [whispers] I saw you.
- What?

39
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:19,708
Apologies, good sir. Never mind the girl.
She was kicked in the head by a horse.

40
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:22,375
- Hasn't been right since.
- [whimpers] No.

41
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,958
There was a tower. An arrow struck you.

42
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,833
Remember I said we need to keep
a low profile? That was not that.

43
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:30,625
- I cannot control my visions.
- You can control who you blab to.

44
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,750
Stop hauling me like I'm a mewling brat.

45
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,791
I saw his death
and I need to go back there.

46
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:38,083
What if his death
prevented a greater harm?

47
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,541
What would the consequence be then,
my ugly one?

48
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:43,458
I don't know.

49
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,750
I don't know either.

50
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,833
But changing destiny
is a weighty business.

51
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,083
Your visions are becoming more frequent.

52
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:54,208
It's only a matter of time
before someone finds us.

53
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,625
[sighs] We need to get to Aretuza
more quickly.

54
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,083
You're afraid.

55
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,666
I promised Geralt I'd keep you safe.
We need something untraceable.

56
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,125
We're going shopping.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,500
[steady heartbeat]

58
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,416
[Jaskier] I'll never get over how cute
they look, you know? For monsters.

59
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,708
I mean, they've got
these little teddy bear faces,

60
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,166
and they're like...
[squeakily] "No, please, don't hurt me!"

61
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,333
And then, wham, fangs.

62
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,541
Just, like, a boatload of fangs.
All up in your business.

63
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,250
How many people
did you say this thing ate?

64
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,416
- Seven.
- Yikes.

65
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,958
- And we'll need all of that.
- All right, we... Whoa.

66
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:49,500
Really? I mean, how much could
their information possibly cost?

67
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,666
To find who's hunting Ciri? A lot.

68
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,750
Really? And why do we need that?

69
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:55,958
[gasps]

70
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:57,625
[loud heartbeat]

71
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,166
Whoa!

72
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,875
Is that a giant metal spike
hidden in your secret door of mystery

73
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,458
or are you just pleased to...

74
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,041
- Not your best.
- Yeah, can't all be gold.

75
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,375
Ah.

76
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:15,166
How did I know that would be you?

77
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,000
- Hello, Codringher.
- Hello, Geralt.

78
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:21,500
Oh, goodness me,
the Viscount of Lettenhove.

79
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,166
A rare pleasure.

80
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:28,083
You know, I had that safety device
replaced just now.

81
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,708
Next time, make an appointment, eh?

82
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Come in.

83
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:40,208
- [officer shouts]
- [soldiers shout in reply]

84
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:44,416
Good morrow, my lord. 'Tis ready for you.

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
[soldiers continue shouting]

86
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:50,500
[grunts] Hmm.

87
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:57,166
Now, this will help get you
what you deserve.

88
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,791
- You had them fix the balance?
- No shit. You told me to.

89
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:04,833
My wife rather likes my head.

90
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,291
- So I thought, best to follow orders.
- Huh.

91
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:12,250
You know,
a sword like this won me an empire once.

92
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:14,833
Hmm. I'd like to hear about it.

93
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,916
- [metal clanking]
- [horses neighing]

94
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,041
Late summer. 1260.

95
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,166
[dramatic music]

96
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,000
I was down to the last of my men.

97
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,333
We hadn't eaten in days.

98
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:32,875
Our swords were dull as spoons
from the bloody skirmishes. Aah...

99
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,666
[sighs]

100
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,583
It was my last chance
to take down the Usurper.

101
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,791
[spits]

102
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,166
I realized

103
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:48,166
the only way
that I could reclaim my throne

104
00:05:49,166 --> 00:05:50,708
was to infiltrate the castle,

105
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:56,208
kill everyone that stood between me
and the man that's stolen my life.

106
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:57,833
A brave endeavor.

107
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,541
- You mean a foolish one.
- [chuckles]

108
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:04,875
[man] Emperor.

109
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:10,166
I traded my boots to a dwarf
in return for a Mahakam steel sword.

110
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,291
Aaah.

111
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,833
It was that sword
that decapitated the bastard.

112
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,416
[slaps table]

113
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,333
One day,

114
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,250
war will be a thing of the past.

115
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:24,791
It will be a distant memory.

116
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:28,250
I will have my queen by my side

117
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,750
and the races of our world,
they will live in peace.

118
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,875
And you will make me a new sword.

119
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,291
One worthy of your craft.

120
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:41,208
A sword befitting
the Emperor of the Continent.

121
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,166
I'll drink to that.

122
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,416
[man 1 wailing]

123
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,250
- [man 2] What is it?
- [man 3 coughing]

124
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,291
Fuck Kaer Morhen!

125
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,375
Not poison.

126
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,458
[man 3 vomiting and coughing]

127
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,208
[chains jingling]

128
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,041
[distant door slams]

129
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,416
Everyone drink.

130
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Drink.

131
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,333
I can't.

132
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,625
You want the White Flame to be poisoned?

133
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,333
[man 3 groaning and coughing]

134
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,333
Drink.

135
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,958
[yelps]

136
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,250
[groans]

137
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,333
[guard] I said, drink.

138
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:46,208
It's not poison.

139
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,500
Jaskier! This is a treat.

140
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:54,541
Oh, I can assure you, madam,
the treat is entirely mine.

141
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,500
Oh!

142
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:59,333
I'd sign something for you, but it does
look like you have a shortage on paper.

143
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,833
You once said that, like a witcher,

144
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:07,291
you protect people from monsters
and monstrous difficulties.

145
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:10,666
Since you already knew of my arrival,

146
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,208
let's talk about my... difficulties.

147
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,666
[Fenn clears throat]

148
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,250
[horse neighing outside]

149
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:25,041
That Rience, who interests you so much,
is quite a mysterious character.

150
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,458
Mmm, we've heard of him, of course.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,125
The question is,

152
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,250
why have you?

153
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,208
He threatened to kill a friend of mine.

154
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:38,375
- Not me. Don't worry.
- [cat yowls]

155
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,708
Sorcerer's rejects
do often train as killers.

156
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:46,708
And this Rience,
we know, was kicked out of Ban Ard.

157
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:48,833
- That supports our theory.
- What theory?

158
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:51,291
That he's working
for a sorcerer more powerful than him.

159
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:56,791
Hmm.

160
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,875
[playful music]

161
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,583
- [coins jingle]
- [cat screeches]

162
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,916
You alarmed my cat.

163
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,458
[Geralt] I do apologize.

164
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,750
I assumed the clink of coin
was the last thing that would startle it.

165
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:15,041
I'm afraid that information
will cost you a bit more, Geralt.

166
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,333
Let's try a wager.

167
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,500
I shall turn my back,

168
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:28,583
and you shall throw this at my head.

169
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,125
Should you hit,

170
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,541
you win.

171
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,458
- [cat yowls]
- Should you miss,

172
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,791
you will give me the information
that I want,

173
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,541
on credit, of course.

174
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:43,833
You're not seriously suggesting
that I accept this wager?

175
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:45,666
[Geralt] No, I'm...

176
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,333
sure you will.

177
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,541
[sighs]

178
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,250
You didn't even flinch.

179
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:06,041
Why would I flinch?

180
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,041
I heard you aiming to miss.

181
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,458
[Fenn] Old softy.

182
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,208
[dog barking outside]

183
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:20,041
Some official sorcerers have secret pupils

184
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,416
doing illegal or... dirty business.

185
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,375
In sorcerer slang, it's described
as having someone on a leash.

186
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,708
Whose leash?

187
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,000
We don't know.

188
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:35,041
But we do know where this sorcerer
is doing his dirty business.

189
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,416
There is a castle called Vuilpanne,
uh, near the old scarlet...

190
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,333
- Ammonite mines.
- Yeah.

191
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:42,833
On the outskirts of Piana.

192
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,916
If you know that,
you're already in too deep.

193
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,958
This mage, whoever it is,

194
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,333
is very dangerous.

195
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,000
Let it lie, Geralt.

196
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,458
I shall not. But you knew that already.

197
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,333
Thank you for your time.

198
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:06,416
Do give our best
to the Elder Blood princess.

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,583
You have a client looking for her?

200
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:23,125
Istredd.

201
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,750
- The mage?
- [mouths]

202
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:30,250
You must know
he isn't the only one willing to pay

203
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,000
for the girl traveling
with the white-haired witcher.

204
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:37,208
You want to save her?
You need to find another girl...

205
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,875
An orphan of war, perhaps.

206
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,416
- Ashen hair, green eyes...
- No.

207
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,125
[Codringher] Geralt, my friend,

208
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,250
a time of contempt is approaching.

209
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:53,333
Deep and utter contempt.

210
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,500
My proposition is a simple solution.

211
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,750
Someone has to die

212
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,625
so someone else

213
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,708
can live.

214
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:08,208
[sighs]

215
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:12,833
I will not pay for what I love
by having contempt for myself.

216
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,083
Let's go.

217
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Thank you.

218
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,750
Rogue mages, power-hungry monarchs,
and now Istredd.

219
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,708
Aren't you tired
of being on the run all the time?

220
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,625
Maybe we could find
somewhere safe for her?

221
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:37,750
Why don't we brainstorm solutions
on our way to Redania?

222
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:40,458
Hey.

223
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,375
I can hear you thinking.

224
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,208
Don't start playing
the "I travel alone" card

225
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,250
or "Jaskier, it's too dangerous" card.

226
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,041
I would like to remind you
that I was just bait

227
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:52,833
for Mr. Fire-Fingers.

228
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,583
I appreciate it, Jask.

229
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,583
I don't want to put you
in harm's way again.

230
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,250
It's why I have to go to Vuilpanne.

231
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,000
I'll come find you when Rience is dead.

232
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,458
Or he'll find me once you are.

233
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,041
[sighs]

234
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,083
[foreboding music]

235
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,500
[traders calling]

236
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:29,750
- What are we shopping for, exactly?
- [Yennefer] A miracle. Keep up.

237
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,541
- [bells ringing]
- [cows mooing]

238
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,125
What was that letter you sent earlier?

239
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:39,916
It's for Tissaia.
Telling her I'm coming home.

240
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,958
Is there a chance she might say no?

241
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:46,333
It's complicated. [sniffs]

242
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,166
Because of me?

243
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,083
Yes, you do tend to complicate things.

244
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,333
Yes, well, I'm not the only one.

245
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,458
You may be watching me,

246
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,208
but I have eyes too.

247
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:06,541
And what do you see, my ugly one?

248
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,875
Most times,
a picture of powerful perfection.

249
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,750
Excellent. [laughs]

250
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,083
But you wrote three drafts of that letter.

251
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,166
So there's more to the picture,
isn't there?

252
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:23,791
[Yennefer] We need to keep moving.

253
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,750
Here. Run this
through that tangled mop on your head.

254
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:31,958
- [guard] Password.
- [Yennefer] Ragamuffin.

255
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,916
[Yennefer] Training hasn't helped
control your power as I'd hoped.

256
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,458
If anything, it's brought it
to the surface, made it more present.

257
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,125
[Ciri] Great.

258
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:45,250
At Aretuza,
you can learn to focus your visions

259
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,333
on the future you actually want to see.

260
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:49,776
- [man 1] Over here!
- What if I don't want to see anything?

261
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,000
Well, then you're blind
to the big picture.

262
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,291
[man 2] Put it down there!

263
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:55,583
Here she is. Come along!

264
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,500
- [traders shouting]
- [goats bleating]

265
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,041
Yen! Thank the gods, you're alive.

266
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,041
[kissing]

267
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:06,208
- Tell me you've got good gossip.
- No time, Keira. I need your help.

268
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,375
My handmaiden and I are in need
of one of your portals.

269
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,166
To Aretuza.

270
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,208
You're going back to Aretuza?

271
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,041
After that legendary night
of non-fatal execution?

272
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,791
Well, I'm hoping they've forgotten
about that. Or forgiven me, anyway.

273
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,708
Mmph! Good luck.
Tissaia still hasn't forgiven me.

274
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,625
You fuck one upstart prince
with designs on the throne...

275
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,833
Anyway, it's good to see you.

276
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,958
Business has been achingly slow.

277
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,458
People are decapitated
if they stray their kingdoms.

278
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,375
By whom?

279
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,125
- Each other.
- [Keira scoffs]

280
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:36,408
With Nilfgaard on the horizon,

281
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:39,041
you'd think the North
would have got their shit together by now.

282
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,458
- Is there nothing the Brotherhood can do?
- [man] Oi, hurry up.

283
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,666
- Go on.
- [whimpers]

284
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,625
I need a portal to Claremont.

285
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,541
This one's got somethin' waitin' for them.

286
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:58,791
[man scoffs]

287
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,291
Now.

288
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,208
[sniffing]

289
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,375
[groans]

290
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,708
- [sighs]
- [clicking]

291
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,416
[chuckles]

292
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:13,708
Fancy a sniff, love?

293
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:15,791
I don't partake.

294
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:20,916
[gasps]

295
00:16:21,416 --> 00:16:23,458
- [crowd screeching]
- [woman] Kill the bitch!

296
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:25,625
[screaming]

297
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,416
Ciri! [yelps]

298
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,041
[speaking in Elder]

299
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,000
[man] Hold it open. I won't be long.

300
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,083
Run! Run!

301
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,708
[man] Hey! What the fuck?

302
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:41,958
[thump]

303
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:44,375
You have no idea who you've just crossed...

304
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:46,458
- [low rumbling]
- [gurgles]

305
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:51,875
[man spluttering]

306
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,458
[creaking]

307
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:55,875
[crack]

308
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,496
[Keira] What have you done?

309
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,041
That was one of Houvenaghel's men.

310
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,875
If you don't want to end up decapitated,
I suggest you run too.

311
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:06,750
- Keira, wait...
- [whoosh]

312
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,958
[voices approaching]

313
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,083
Go.

314
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:16,000
Magic is organizing Chaos.

315
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,166
This requires two things.

316
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:21,208
Balance and control.

317
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,500
Without them, Chaos will kill you.

318
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,416
Has anyone seen Nissa?

319
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,083
Elizabet, fetch Nissa from her room,

320
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,791
and remind her that sickness of any sort,
including homesickness,

321
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,416
will not be tolerated.

322
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,958
[Vilgefortz] Go back and try again,
Sabrina. We cannot let this stand.

323
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,625
I'm telling you, he's immovable.

324
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,541
He says Foltest and his people can starve
for all he cares.

325
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,500
[Stregobor] Even if Henselt wanted
to send the grain to Temeria,

326
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:56,083
the damn Scoia'tael
would just steal it on the way.

327
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,916
We're wondering why
the kings are losing faith in us.

328
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,791
Because we knew the elves were a problem
and we did nothing about it.

329
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,708
That's... a short-sighted view of history.

330
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,166
But I expect nothing less from you.

331
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,666
[Artorius] Enough coddling.

332
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,791
Return Triss to Foltest's court
and let's get this rough patch smoothed.

333
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:17,583
That would be as useful
as putting bandage on a severed limb.

334
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:21,166
Tissaia promised them
Cirilla of Cintra's head on a platter

335
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,458
and she failed to deliver.

336
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,666
We want peace,
let's find the brat and kill her.

337
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,666
No!

338
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,041
Last I checked, slinging matches are not
how we conduct business here.

339
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:34,500
We will take all concerns to the full body
of the Council, as we always have.

340
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,625
In the meantime,
you are disrupting lessons.

341
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,666
[sighs]

342
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:50,958
[Tissaia] They're not wrong.

343
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,416
Loath as I am to admit it...

344
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
- If you return to court...
- I told you.

345
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:58,833
The Brotherhood is welcome
to fill my position at Temeria any time.

346
00:18:58,916 --> 00:19:02,750
I am best placed here with you, helping
these girls learn what they're capable of.

347
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,750
It is a noble calling.

348
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,333
But I can't help but wonder
if it's really about them.

349
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,920
[whispers] Just because
you couldn't help Ciri...

350
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,000
I will go and check on Nissa.

351
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:21,833
[door opens]

352
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,875
[footsteps fading]

353
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,458
[pensive music]

354
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:34,375
Nissa?

355
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,416
[girls laughing and chatting]

356
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,958
- [whip blow lands]
- [Dijkstra groans]

357
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,333
[Philippa] Tell me about the elf.

358
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,500
[Dijkstra] Count de Noailles
had captured an elf.

359
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,666
He said she was an assassin. [whimpers]

360
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,791
- [blow lands]
- [Philippa] Louder!

361
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,375
[splutters]

362
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
[Philippa] Speak!

363
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:34,666
He... made me cut her...

364
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:37,875
in a thousand different ways.

365
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
And...

366
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,666
[Philippa] What did you do?

367
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:48,000
I... cut too deep.

368
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,875
And that was my first kill.

369
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:58,916
[yelps]

370
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,666
Please, no...

371
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,666
Did that excite you?

372
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:08,791
[mouths]

373
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:10,833
No.

374
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:13,625
It made me angry.

375
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,708
It was a waste.

376
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,458
We could have turned that elf.

377
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,083
Made her do our bidding.

378
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,166
She could have... been useful.

379
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,750
Yes. Useful.

380
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:35,041
Good boy.

381
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,291
[groans]

382
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,666
[breathing heavily]

383
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,125
You, uh... you went
quite a bit harder that time.

384
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,666
Not too hard?

385
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:58,333
You always give me perspective. Clarity.

386
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:01,375
[groans] Thank you.

387
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,875
I need you to do something in return.

388
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,833
Radovid has surprisingly good instincts.

389
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:12,666
Perhaps he could help
keep Vizimir in line.

390
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:15,208
I don't need help.
I've been managing him for years.

391
00:22:15,291 --> 00:22:17,916
I've never seen
this Continent more divided.

392
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:22,875
Nilfgaard's not the only ones
who know it's ripe for the taking.

393
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:25,208
And if Radovid could be useful to us...

394
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,958
To Redania.

395
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,583
Speak to him. Hmm?

396
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,375
[whispers] For me.

397
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,458
[sighs]

398
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,750
Hmm.

399
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,875
We're done.

400
00:22:50,416 --> 00:22:52,416
[conversation and laughter]

401
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:57,916
Ahem.

402
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,583
[silence falls]

403
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,500
[man whispers] It's him. Jaskier.

404
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,958
[woman] It's the Dandelion.

405
00:23:05,666 --> 00:23:08,083
- [man] Can't believe it!
- My man said I had a visitor.

406
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,250
But this, I must say, is a nice surprise.

407
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:13,500
- Mmm.
- Have you come to sing us a pretty song?

408
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:17,166
Ha, ha! Uh, no. No, I don't, uh...
I don't do pretty.

409
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,375
I have information.

410
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:25,333
Those two detectives,
Codringher and Fenn, you've heard of them?

411
00:23:25,416 --> 00:23:26,416
No.

412
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:28,750
Regardless,

413
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,625
they know who Rience is working for.

414
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,541
- Trivia.
- Mm-hmm.

415
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,625
Oh, tell me.

416
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:38,333
Geralt is determined to solve it
in his Geralt way,

417
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:42,500
because he didn't have enough money
to pry their lips apart, but...

418
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,875
you do, I assume.

419
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,500
I appreciate the information,

420
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:52,083
I do, but what I really want is a song.

421
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,000
Uh... [laughs]

422
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:56,125
No. No, I'm, uh...
not really in a singing mood.

423
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,583
- Oh, go on.
- No. Uh...

424
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,833
Your clientele look like they're having
a very lovely time without me...

425
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:03,083
Pick your favorite. Please.

426
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,916
They'd love a song
about your white-haired witcher.

427
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:08,833
All right.

428
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,291
[man whispers] I'm so excited!

429
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,291
[crow cawing]

430
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:22,125
[ominous music]

431
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,708
[Roach snorts]

432
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,041
- It's probably a trap.
- [neighs]

433
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,500
Mm-hmm.

434
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:48,000
[sighs]

435
00:24:50,291 --> 00:24:52,291
[bats squeaking]

436
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:04,541
[water dripping]

437
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,333
[sighs]

438
00:25:33,333 --> 00:25:34,750
[croaking]

439
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,833
[deep rumbling]

440
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,541
[whispering voices]

441
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,583
Definitely a trap.

442
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:07,250
[Ciri] May as well talk about it.

443
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:10,333
I know you're angry.

444
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:13,791
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.

445
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,916
I did say we needed
to avoid unwanted attention.

446
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I know.

447
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,245
[Yennefer] This one's on me.

448
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,083
In all those lessons,
I should have taught you

449
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,791
that sometimes,
discretion is more important than valor.

450
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:31,708
You sound like Geralt.

451
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,416
Well, he isn't always wrong.

452
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:38,500
One day, I may be queen,
and I'll need to use what I've got.

453
00:26:38,583 --> 00:26:43,208
And what I've got is a sense of justice,
a dagger and quick reflexes.

454
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:47,458
- You and Geralt taught me those things.
- Then our teachings were incomplete.

455
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:49,583
We should have taught you
about consequences.

456
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:52,208
Consequences are just
an excuse not to act.

457
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,416
Even when someone's going to be killed.

458
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,625
You didn't see that child's eyes.

459
00:26:56,708 --> 00:26:59,833
- I had to do what I did...
- No, you chose to interfere.

460
00:27:02,125 --> 00:27:05,166
That messenger in Ellander,
his fate is a mystery.

461
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,916
But I know what will happen here.

462
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:11,208
Dominik Houvenaghel will send
his cousin Leo Bonhart here

463
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:13,958
to recuperate his losses
with money or with blood.

464
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,416
The townspeople who do survive
will be conscripted to fight

465
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,416
against the war
that's looming on the horizon,

466
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,708
where they'll die on the battlefield.

467
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,708
If disease or starvation
doesn't claim them first.

468
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:26,750
You saved one,

469
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:30,291
and the consequence has likely
damned a hundred others in exchange.

470
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,666
What is the point in me seeing the future
if I can't do anything to change it?

471
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:44,083
Well, why would you understand?
You see what you want, you make it happen.

472
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:46,791
You snap your fingers, mountains move.

473
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,833
Men bend to your will.

474
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:53,291
How would you know what it's like
to fight for control of your life?

475
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,083
Where are you going?

476
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,625
More shopping?

477
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:08,125
No, my ugly one.

478
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:09,541
We're taking a detour.

479
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,166
Why do you call me that?

480
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:15,958
Because I promised

- [Cahir chuckles]
- I believe in facts.

The fact is, Francesca's <i>Hen Ichaer</i>
is a girl from Cintra.

- [Gallatin] Aye.
- [both grunt]

You. You were Emhyr's top general.

If he's a wise man, as you say,

why the hell's he wasting

Lied to him.

528
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:58,791
He trusted me to fulfill
his most sacred mission, and I failed.

529
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:03,833
So your plan is to keep paying penance
until you're killed by Northern troops?

He must be quite a man
to inspire such cock-eyed loyalty.

Oh, friend,
your men hold you in the same regard,

even if you are
an old, ugly, arrogant prick.

Well, if I agree to your proposal,

what does overthrowing Francesca
say about my loyalty?

Gallatin,

537
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,791
you are one of the finest soldiers
I've ever fought beside.

538
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,125
The White Flame will see it.

539
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:34,750
You will help him take the North,
not Francesca.

540

He earned my loyalty.

than most could comprehend.

00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,125

[heartbeat speeds up]

645
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:07,708
- Please. Come help us.
- He'll come back for us. He always does.

646
00:38:07,791 --> 00:38:09,166
- Help us!
- Please, just once!

647
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,666
[girl] Help me!

648
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,500
[gasping]

649
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,750
Help me, please! Please!

650
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:16,875
- Can you help us?
- Please, he'll be back soon.

651
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:18,500
- I can't feel anything.
- Please.

652
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,416
- I can't...
- Please. Come back.

653
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,125
- Help us. Please, please.
- I don't want to die here...

654
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:25,625
[girl whimpering] Help me!

655
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:26,708
Help me!

00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:33,583
- Help! [gasping]
- I won't hurt you.

658
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:35,708
Are you all right?

[whimpering]

660
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:39,583
Are there any more like you here?

[crying]

662
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,541
So many.

663
00:38:43,583 --> 00:38:44,708
More and more.

- Please...

666
00:38:51,083 --> 00:38:52,291
He comes for us.

667
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,083
In the night.

668
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:56,291
- [head 1] Stop him.
- [head 2] He has to be stopped!

669
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,625
- Make him stop, please.
- [Geralt] The man you're speaking of...

670
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:02,416
[girl 3] Make him... come back...

671
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,125
Was his name Rience?

672
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:07,250
Elven scum.

673
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:08,583
[mutters]

674
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:10,833

[heads screaming]

684
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,166
Why are you hurting us?

- [head 2] Make him stop!

688
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:04,041
Don't let him kill us!

689
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:13,708
[head 2] Don't kill us!

690
00:40:15,083 --> 00:40:16,916
It's too late. Go!

[sighs]

714
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:32,041
They all thought the baker
was an innocent bystander,

715
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:34,250
but I told them,
he was the contortionist's aim

716
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:35,875
right from the beginning! [chortling]

717
00:42:35,958 --> 00:42:37,583
[courtiers laugh loudly]

718

[lively music]

719
00:42:38,916 --> 00:42:41,916
Uh... but speaking of things
that go bump in the night,

720
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,041
did I ever tell you about the time I saw
a young elf leaving Virfuril's bedchamber?

721
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:49,208
- Darling, Virfuril is a frivolous fool.
- Hmm.

722
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:53,166
- What would I do without you, darling?
- Well, clearly not much, darling.

723
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,208
- Eva, more meat.
- Yes, m'lady.

724
00:42:55,791 --> 00:42:58,500
He said that he was there
for an interrogation.

725
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:01,458
Well, torture would explain
the sounds I heard.

726
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:03,000
[laughter]

727
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,188
I just had the most intriguing visit
from the witcher's friend.

728
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:11,041
He seems to think those old farts
Codringher and Fenn

729
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,791
might have some info about Rience.

730
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:13,875
And?

731
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,583
And I'm wondering if perhaps
our methods of obtaining the girl

732
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:19,958
would be more easily achieved
with a carrot than a stick.

733
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:21,791
How very interesting.

734
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:25,416
Perhaps I need
to pay those old farts a visit too, hmm?

735
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,958
- [Vizimir] Passing me, same passage!
- [laughter]

736
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:30,625
Picture the elf,
standing in the snow, belt unbuckled,

737
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,916
a delicious look of guilt across his face.

738
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,541
Now, being the fair-minded king that I am,
I said, "I'll give you a head start,

739
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,291
but you are due an arrow in the bum."

740
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:40,041
Now, I yell "Go,"

741
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,125
he scuttles off like a wounded deer,

742
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:44,041
and then I shot the elf, like this.

743
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:45,166
Hold still, I say.

744
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:48,041
- [courtiers cheer and applaud]
- [Vizimir] Yeah!

745
00:43:48,791 --> 00:43:50,666
Aplegatt! You lucky bastard!

746
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,833
- Ah.
- [Vizimir] What word do you bring?

747
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:56,666
Now, have I ever told you
about the first time...

748
00:43:57,416 --> 00:44:00,416
You don't seem to be enjoying
my brother's epic tales of derring-do.

749
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,458
- [Vizimir] Aplegatt was...
- Hmm. I've heard this tale before.

750
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:06,351
- It doesn't improve by repetition.
- [Vizimir] But that's another story!

751
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:08,541
Alas, my brother's not renowned
for his wit.

752
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:12,875
Philippa seems to think that you might
have more wit than meets the eye.

753
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:15,628
[Vizimir] ...when, through the branches,
I see...

754
00:44:15,708 --> 00:44:17,958
- Or not.
- [Vizimir] ...dark-furred...

755
00:44:18,666 --> 00:44:20,041
Surely, as Redania's spymaster,

756
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:23,166
you must realize that everyone
in this room's hiding something.

757
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:27,083
Even those like my brother,
who seem to be witless.

758
00:44:27,166 --> 00:44:29,208
Vizimir has no secrets from me.

759
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,541
Then you do know
about his meeting last night?

760
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:35,083
With Nilfgaard.

761
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:46,291
[cat yowls]

762
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:48,500
Did you hear something?

763
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:49,916
- No.
- Really?

764
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:51,666
- Nothing.
- [cat growls]

765
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,166
Why am I even asking? You're going deaf.

766
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:56,250
I'll have you...

767
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,916
- Heard you had a visitor.
- We have lots of... [cries out]

768
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,640
- [groans]
- [Rience] You know who I mean.

769
00:45:02,708 --> 00:45:03,750
The witcher was here.

770
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:06,125
I can still smell his stench.
What did you tell him?

771
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:11,000
Don't worry. We didn't mention
anything about your employer.

772
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:15,291
Or what he's really got planned
for Cirilla of Cintra.

773
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:18,166
What do you know about his plans?

774
00:45:24,416 --> 00:45:25,458
Huh.

775
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:30,833
[meowing]

776
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:32,583

777
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:34,041
[Fenn] Please. Not the cat!

778
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:35,416
Tell me everything.

- [heavy rainfall]

782
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:04,791
So... are you going to let
Yennefer come home?

783
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:07,833
[sighs] Let her? She's already on her way.

784
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,208
[Vilgefortz] Of course she is.

785
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,000
With an agenda, no doubt.

786
00:46:16,916 --> 00:46:18,208
- [Tissaia sighs]
- Hmm?

787
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:20,083
[chuckles]

788
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:23,708
Oh, she's as fair-weathered
as the fog over this island.

789
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:27,958
Triss is right.

790
00:46:29,666 --> 00:46:31,291
Gods forbid, Stregobor too.

791
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:35,000
We need to get the Northern kings
to listen to us and work together.

792
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,403
The last thing they'd want to see

793
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:39,083
is the woman
who set their execution party ablaze.

794
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:42,708
[sighs shakily]

795
00:46:43,458 --> 00:46:44,458
But you love her.

796
00:46:48,708 --> 00:46:50,875
I think your mind
is struggling to catch up

797
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:53,666
with the decision
your heart's already made.

798
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,208
[wistful music]

799
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:57,000
You head the Council with me.

800
00:46:57,833 --> 00:46:59,125
How do you feel?

801
00:47:00,791 --> 00:47:03,208
- Gods know you weren't fond of her.
- [chuckles]

802
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,666
That's only because
we have too much in common.

803
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:09,958
- Bad tempers.
- Hmm.

804
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,208
Impetuousness.

805
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:15,416
The overwhelming need to win an argument.

806
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,791
[laughs]

807
00:47:21,041 --> 00:47:22,958
And we have one other thing in common.

808
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:27,166
Our love

809
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:29,875
for you.

810
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:47,125
If Yennefer can let go of the past,

811
00:47:48,333 --> 00:47:49,333
so can I.

812
00:47:53,291 --> 00:47:55,041
[gentle ringing]

813
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:58,958
- What's this?
- An old superstition.

814
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:02,500
The stones are rumored
to have protective abilities.

815
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:07,375
You could just tell me
you were thinking of me.

816
00:48:07,458 --> 00:48:08,583
[Vilgefortz chuckles]

817
00:48:11,375 --> 00:48:13,125
[wistful music builds]

818
00:48:13,208 --> 00:48:15,208
[gentle ringing continues]

819
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:17,833
[thunder rumbling]

820
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:21,166
I'll meet Yennefer at Gors Velen.

821
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:23,708
Make sure she's not bringing trouble.

822
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,250
[crows cawing]

823
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:40,000
[poignant music]

824
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,458
Our detour was to a field.

825
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:56,166
A house used to stand here.

826
00:48:58,166 --> 00:48:59,291
My house.

827
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:03,833
This is where I grew up.

828
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:16,096
[Yennefer's father]
<i>Get out of there, girl!</i>

829
00:49:16,125 --> 00:49:17,708
[Yennefer] <i>I can do it! </i>[grunts]

830
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:19,041
[Tissaia] <i>How much for a pig?</i>

831
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:20,291
How much for this beast?

832
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:21,666
[mother] <i>She's our daughter!</i>

833
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,250
[father] <i>She's no daughter of mine.</i>

834
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:24,666
[Yennefer] <i>You can't take me!</i>

835
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,291
- [screams]
- I won't go.

836
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:29,416
Don't you dare take your eyes off me.

837
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,833
[screaming]

838
00:49:30,916 --> 00:49:33,875
You do not have a choice.

839
00:49:39,416 --> 00:49:43,333
- [gasps]
- My whole life I've had so much power.

840
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,375
But I've never been perfect.

841
00:49:47,875 --> 00:49:50,250
I fought with Tissaia
every step of the way.

842
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:53,375
I wanted to do things my way.

843
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:55,916
That letter?

844
00:49:57,291 --> 00:50:00,083
I don't know
if I'll be welcomed back to Aretuza.

845
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:03,083
Like you, I once chose to interfere.

846
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:06,125
I set a prisoner free.

847
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:10,958
And in doing so, I set the entire North
against the Brotherhood.

848
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,958
And the Brotherhood against each other.

849
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:19,083
Those bodies hanging at the tavern.

850
00:50:21,666 --> 00:50:23,041
All those executions.

851
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:25,750
The whole Continent
is paying the consequences.

852
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
And you.

853
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:31,166
Because of me.

854
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:35,416
It's not enough to possess Chaos.

855
00:50:35,916 --> 00:50:36,916
You and I,

856
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,791
we must learn to control it.

857
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:41,750
That is the essence of power.

858
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,750
That is how we will move mountains.

859
00:50:47,916 --> 00:50:48,916
Together.

860
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:52,916
Come along,

861
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:55,791
Ciri.

862
00:51:09,833 --> 00:51:11,875
[echoing howling]

863
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:26,333
[wind whistling]

864
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,041
[crows cawing]

865
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:33,583
Hmm.

866
00:51:34,833 --> 00:51:36,208
- Hello?
- [gasps]

867
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,541
You're out of that place now. You're safe.

868
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:49,166
Are you all right?

869
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,916
I knew you'd come for me.

870
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,125
And how'd you know that?

871
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,750
Because you always do.

872
00:52:04,916 --> 00:52:06,708
We're tied by destiny.

873
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:11,666
Who are you?

874
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:14,250
Don't be silly, Geralt.

875
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,375
You know who I am.

876
00:52:18,166 --> 00:52:19,375
I'm Ciri.

877
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:20,958
[dramatic music]
