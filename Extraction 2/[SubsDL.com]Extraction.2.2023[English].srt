00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:33,958
[Nik] Tyler!

[girl shouting in Bengali]

4
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,708
[indistinct shouting]

5
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:53,666
[man] He's breathing, he's breathing.

6
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:22,791
[speaking indistinctly]

7
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,791
Multiple gunshot wounds.

8
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,250
Airway's secured.

9
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,541
[doctor, in Arabic]
We've done everything we can.

10
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:57,333
It would be wise to consider a threshold.

11
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,333
[Yaz, in French] Sis... it's not fair
to leave him like this.

12
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,166
[Nik] I'm not giving up on him.

13
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,125
[Tyler grunts softly]

14
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,750
[in English] What was that?

15
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,791
- Fuck off.
- [chuckles]

16
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,875
- [Tyler exhales weakly]
- [buzzer sounds]

17
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:24,166
[machine whirring]

18
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,333
And we're going to hold for five.

19
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:32,666
- [grunting]
- Four, three, two...

20
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,250
Keep it slow.

21
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,625
[breathing heavily]

22
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,875
Just go home, would ya?

23
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:07,125
Or what? You'll run over my foot?

24
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,833
That's about all I could do.

25
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,875
Thanks, Nik. For keeping me around.

26
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,875
Really excited about
this next chapter of my life.

27
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,500
[chuckles]

28
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,750
Believe it or not,

29
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,833
it's pretty difficult
to let someone you care about die.

30
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:32,750
But you fought your way back.

31
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:37,291
You just have to find out why.

32
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
[goats bleating]

33
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:13,541
[man] Zurab.

34
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,791
[in Georgian]
I just heard from the prison.

35
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,958
They're extending your brother's
prison sentence by ten years.

36
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,541
[men yelling in Georgian]

[cows mooing]

39
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,958
[Zurab] Governor.

40
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,208
[chuckles]

41
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,833
Zurab. Always wonderful to see you.

42
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:23,583
How are you, my friend?

43
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,291
I've been better.

44
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,250
One of our prize bulls is sick.

45
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:31,125
We have to kill him.
Bury him before he infects the others.

46
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,166
You asked me here to commiserate?

47
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,000
Walk with me, would you?

48
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,875
You said it was urgent.

49
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,875
I just heard that this morning
you signed off on

50
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:52,916
extending my brother's prison sentence
by ten years.

51
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,583
Your brother threw a DEA agent off a roof.

52
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,125
The Americans are all over us.

53
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,833
When Davit and I were young,

54
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,333
I was to protect my brother at all costs.

55
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,083
My father would never let me forget it.

56
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:17,333
I contested his extradition to the States.

57
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,583
Kept him in a Georgian prison.

58
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,708
I even allowed his family
to be housed in prison with him.

59
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:29,250
Let's not forget who put you
in this office. And why.

60
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:33,333
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

61
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,041
One of our prize bulls is sick.

62
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,833
I told you.

63
00:08:57,916 --> 00:09:00,125
[guns firing]

64
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:18,916
My man! Looking good. Look at this.

65
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What's with the shirt?
You lose a bet or something?

66
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,208
- Don't you like it?
- No.

67
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:26,125
I'll get you one.
What's your size, 44 regular?

68
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,125
I mean, you're little bit slimmer, no?

69
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,291
Shut up.

70
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,625
I missed you, too.

71
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,375
He wanted to pull the plug.

72
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,375
Nah, that's not true. She lies.

73
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,333
You would have been doing me a favor.

74
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,833
Next time. You have my word.

75
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,708
[scoffs] It's funny,
your sister said the same thing.

76
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,791
[Tyler grunting]

77
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,500
What the hell's this?

78
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,500
[Nik] A gift.

79
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:03,250
You're welcome.

80
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:05,750
You bring my chickens?

81
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:06,875
[Nik] We ate them.

82
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,208
- What about my dog?
- [Yaz] Oh, we ate her, too.

83
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,000
Jesus, Yaz.

84
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,958
[Yaz] I'm joking. She's in the house.

85
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,791
- What am I supposed to do now?
- Anything you want.

86
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:23,000
I mean, you could go on hikes,
learn to knit.

87
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,541
You know, try to reach mindfulness.

88
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,250
You're gonna like it here.

89
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,958
All right, brother.
I'll send you that shirt.

90
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:35,875
What's this?

91
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:39,208
We packed up your house.
This is all we found.

92
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:43,041
Your entire life fits in one little box.

93
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,708
Maybe it's time to change that.

94
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,541
When am I going to see you again?

95
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,791
When we have something to celebrate.

96
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,333
Enjoy retirement!

97
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,666
Yeah, piss off.

98
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:15,416

- [whining]
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

101
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,833
I wouldn't let 'em eat you, mate.

102

- [woman speaking German]
- [Tyler chuckles]

112
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,291
[in English] Fucking right.

113
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,083
[speaking softly in Georgian]

114
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:50,458
[Ketevan] Don't wake them.
It's hard for them to fall asleep in here.

115
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,083
Come.

116
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,416
No.

117
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,125
No?

118
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,125
Not tonight.

119
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,875
It's been weeks
since they've seen the sun.

120
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:06,125
They can't survive like this.
It's hard on them.

121
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,375
Hard?

122
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:09,875
He needs to grow up hard.

123
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:12,291
There are other places to hide.

124
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,125
Sure, in here your brother protects us.

125
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,458
But I don't want my son
to become a <i>Nagazi.</i>

126
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,041
The last thing I need is your fat mouth.

127
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,500
What are you going to do?

128
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,333
Drag me into your cell?

129
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,083
You forgetting you're my wife?

130
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,333
Not your property.

131
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:33,125
Maybe I raise them on my own, huh?

132
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,875
You would not be missed.

133
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,791

136
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:06,041
Mom, you okay?

137
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,000
I thought you were sleeping.

138
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:23,125
- Are you sure you are okay?
- I'm fine.

139
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,666
I'm sorry.

140
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,291
It's okay, my love.

141
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,291
Don't worry. It'll be okay.

142
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,666
Maybe Dad is right.

143
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,166
I do need to grow up hard.

144
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,916
So I can become a <i>Nagazi.</i>

145
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,833
This is beautiful, honestly, but the tea?

146
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,000
Not so much.

147
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,375
You're out of milk, by the way.

148
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:28,958
You lost, mate?

149
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,833
Are you Rake?

150
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:34,750
I asked you first.

151
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,375
Yeah, but my answer depends on yours.

152
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,666
See, if you are Rake,
then you are the myth of Mumbai.

153
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,166
The legend that got
the journalist out of Congo,

154
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,125
that took down the two gangs
to save the mayor of Rio.

155
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:47,625
The honor would be all mine.

156
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:50,250
But I have to say, mate,
you're not living up to the hype.

157
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,666
What happened? You fall off a bridge?

158
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,416
How about you put my cup down,
hop in your car, and fuck off?

159
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,500
That's not very nice, is it?

160
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:04,750
Not when we've got a mutual friend
who's offered you a job.

161
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,125
I don't have any friends.

162
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,541
Yeah, well, this particular individual
seems to think

163
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,708
you're the only one that can do it.

164
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:16,625
Me? I'm not so convinced.
Can you even pull the trigger like that?

165
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:17,708
[gunshot]

166
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,375
Now that's why
you haven't got any friends.

167
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,333
Why don't you go back and tell
whoever sent you that I'm not interested.

168
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,291
Yeah?

169
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:34,958
What if it was your ex-wife? Mia.

170
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,666
Is that dog wearing a Valentino shirt?

171
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,791
[Tyler] Yeah. A friend gave it to me.

172
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,333
So, Mia in trouble?

173
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,166
No. But her sister is.

174
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,541
What's she caught up in?

175
00:17:55,625 --> 00:17:58,875
Well, she's currently in a Georgian prison
with her two kids.

176
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,750
Her husband's locked her in there.
Can you imagine that?

177
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,583
- His name's, uh, Davit...
- Davit Radiani. I remember him.

178
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,416
Probably the last time you saw him,

179
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,750
he and his brother Zurab were pushing
dime bags on the streets of Georgia.

180
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,458
But eight years later,
they've built quite an empire.

181
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,458
Call themselves the <i>Nagazi.</i>

182
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,125
It means shepherd, apparently.

183
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,000
The brothers were born into war.

184
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,375
<i>Raised in it. Hardened by it.</i>

185
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,833
<i>When they were kids,
they fled the civil war in Georgia,</i>

186
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,458
<i>with only their lives</i>

187
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,000
<i>and escaped to Armenia.</i>

188
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,750
<i>Their uncle, Avtandil, took them in.</i>

189
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,125
<i>To this day, he runs operations for them.</i>

190
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:39,416
<i>But in Armenia,
they faced a new kind of war.</i>

191
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:44,333
<i>To survive the streets of Yerevan,
they turned to a life of crime.</i>

192
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,958
<i>Started running drugs in their teens,
graduated to murder for hire.</i>

193
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:53,000
<i>They believed they were soldiers,
chosen by God.</i>

194
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:55,666
<i>By the time they returned to Georgia,</i>

195
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,625
<i>they were folk heroes.</i>

196
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:02,666
<i>They offered their recruits
a very powerful thing... family.</i>

197
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:06,291
<i>And so the brothers gained
a cult-like loyalty.</i>

198
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:09,208
And with that,
they basically built themselves

199
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,833
a billion-dollar heroin
and weapons operation.

200
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,750
These brothers have got
all the politicians in their pockets.

201
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,791
They practically run the country.

202
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,791
If it wasn't for the Americans,
Davit would be free.

203
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:20,791
Location?

204
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,458
They're in the Tkachiri Prison.

205
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,916
Now listen to me, pal,
and listen to me really good.

206
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,666
In my expert opinion,
the problem isn't Davit or the guards,

207
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:32,541
it's the two warring gangs
that are imprisoned in there,

208
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:36,375
one of which would just wanna kill her,
but both of which'll wanna kill you.

209
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,000
Now, if I were you,
which I'm obviously not,

210
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,291
I'd want to get in there nice and quiet,
keep my head down,

211
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,208
because the moment Davit finds out
that his family's been taken,

212
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:48,833
you can rest assured that his brother
is gonna wanna throw everything at you,

213
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,166
and I'm talking
about the whole <i>Nagazi </i>army.

214
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,500
Sounds fun.

215
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,583
[sighs]

216
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,541
Job starts in six weeks. We take our cut,

217
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:06,250
and for, uh, political considerations,
you're on your own.

218
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,833
If all goes well,
you don't get caught or shot in the face,

219
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,291
I'll meet you on the other side
and give you a kiss.

220
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,333
Failing that? It's been a pleasure.

221
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,708
[Nik, in French] We can get a shipment
of weapons to Seoul by tomorrow night.

222
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:27,833
And my brother Yaz
will fly there to deliver it personally.

223
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,666
[exclaims softly]
I have tickets to the game tomorrow.

224
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,333
[cell phone buzzing]

225
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,125
Sorry, I have to call you back.

226
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,291
[sighs]

227
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,541
Tyler.

228
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,583
[in English] <i>Yeah, hey, Nik. So listen,</i>

229
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,708
the whole retirement thing
is not gonna work out.

230
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,083
<i>Job came in.</i>

231
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,250
You were clinically dead nine months ago.

232
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:57,125
Yeah, well, I'm not now. Money should be
in your account pretty soon.

233
00:20:57,208 --> 00:21:00,291
What are you talking about?
Why did they come to you?

234
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,375
Haven't you heard, Nik?
I'm a bit of a legend now.

235
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,791
I think being in a coma
must have messed with your memory.

236
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:11,125
<i>I </i>tell you what the job is
and when and how you do it.

237
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:14,416
Yeah, you also told me to find the reason
I fought my way back.

238
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:18,458
Let's find out.

239
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,934
[in French] You're gonna miss the game.

240
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,666

[Nik, on radio] <i>One minute to target.</i>

244
00:22:47,916 --> 00:22:50,500
[Yaz] You know,
my hands are super sweaty lately.

245
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:53,458
I don't like it.
Probably, have low blood sugar.

246
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:54,833
How do you know that?

247
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,833
- Saw it on TikTok.
- You need to get off medical TikTok.

248
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,083
- [in French] You're already edgy.
- I need to talk.

249
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:02,416
[in English] Every time I talk,
the phone hears me,

250
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,083
and I get more medical TikToks.

251
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,375
Then you should delete TikTok.

252
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:08,000
Well, that's a terrible idea.

253
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,708
- [in French] Are you ready?
- Let's go.

Yaz, secure the family. We got no brakes.

481
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,625
- We're almost there.
- [Nik] Hold on.

482
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:13,000
My team's waiting for us
at the end of the line.

483
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,708
Gonna be a rough landing, hold on tight.

- [in Georgian] What's going on?
- [in English] Figure it out later.

485
00:48:31,791 --> 00:48:33,000
[in Georgian] I'm sorry.

486
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,541
[man] This was deeply resourced.

487
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:39,750
Lead operative was A-plus.

488
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,500
There's maybe four or five guys
who could've done this to us.

489
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:44,833
Was this the Chechens?

490
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:46,708
It's not their style.

491
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:48,625
They don't organize like this.

492
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,958
Someone wanted revenge.

493
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,500
With your brother, that's no short list.

494
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,250
No.

495
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,583
This wasn't revenge.

496
00:49:02,791 --> 00:49:04,125
This was something else.

- Got it.

[in Georgian] Where's Father?

501
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,416
There isn't time for this.
Your sister needs help.

502
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,625
I'm not leaving without him.

503
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:45,083
- Come on. Your sister needs help.
- I'm not going.

504

Your father isn't coming.

Is he dead?

506
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:00,166
[in English] Did you kill him?

507
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:02,541
Huh?

00:50:22,583 --> 00:50:25,208
Listen to me!
He was gonna kill your mother. Okay?

515
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:26,500
It was him or her.

516
00:50:31,416 --> 00:50:32,500

- I tried to protect him.
- [Zurab's father] Is this protection?

522

I need you to meet us

I know how to take care of my child.

537

[in Georgian] Calm down.
She's just trying to help.

538

Don't patronize me.

539
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:49,750
A doctor will be there when we land.
Try to rest.

[in English]
Since when do you speak Georgian?

541

Since always.

[Ketevan] She doesn't know?

543

He was married to my sister.

Thanks for the heads-up.

It's not unusual.

552
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:50,208
I should have stayed behind.

My children would be safer with me dead.

00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:34,833
Was my father going to kill my mother?

Sandro...

Answer me!

Don't listen to anything your mother says,
you understand me?

She did this.

568
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:50,375
She had your father killed. Understand?

569
00:54:52,625 --> 00:54:55,583
She has wanted to take you away
from your father for years.

You're a <i>Nagazi. </i>Be your father's son.

Yeah, you had your boy with you.

I was 19.

He was just a baby. So was I.

580
00:55:43,458 --> 00:55:45,875
Listen, I know what your sister
must think of me.

581
00:55:45,958 --> 00:55:49,416
There's nothing I can do to fix that.
I just want you to know that...

582
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,916
It's the most awful thing

My mother hired you to kill him.
Didn't she?

613

No, what your mother did was risk
everything to protect you and your sister.

Save you from that prison
that your father put you in.

He didn't want to.
They'd have killed us on the outside.

- The enemies of the <i>Nagazi.</i>

They'd have come for us and killed us.

He brought us there,
so he could watch over us.

- He brought you there to control you.
- No. He just didn't trust my mother.

Wake up, kid.

621
00:59:56,416 --> 00:59:58,958
He knew she would take you and your sister

622
00:59:59,041 --> 01:00:01,958
and give you a life outside of all that,
not stay trapped with him.

I don't know if you remember.

642
01:02:16,291 --> 01:02:18,250
He'd nearly be as old as you are now.

643
01:02:23,375 --> 01:02:24,416
Last time I saw him,

644
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:26,916
he was sitting in a hospital bed
and drawing.

645
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,708
He had papers and crayons
spread out everywhere.

646
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:31,083
He used to love to draw.

647
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:36,583
I came to say goodbye
'cause I was shipping out to Afghanistan,

648
01:02:37,208 --> 01:02:41,083
and I knew I might not see him again,
he might not be alive when I got back.

649
01:02:43,791 --> 01:02:47,208
So I came to the hospital,
and there he was on the bed, drawing.

650
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:54,250
And you're right, I...

651
01:03:00,416 --> 01:03:01,416
And I left.

652
01:03:06,875 --> 01:03:09,708
Last thing my kid remembers
is me walking out on him.

653
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:15,416
But your mom, she stayed.

654
01:03:17,125 --> 01:03:19,833
She stayed with your father for years
to keep you safe.

655
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:23,625
Even after all the things he did to her,
what you did and didn't see.

656
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:26,875
She stayed to keep you
and your sister safe.

657
01:03:28,375 --> 01:03:31,125
I'm not gonna lie to you, mate,
shit's gonna get harder,

658
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:33,489
but you'll have to take care of her.
She's gonna need you.

659
01:03:34,958 --> 01:03:37,375
So you can be there for her
like she was for you.

660
01:03:38,833 --> 01:03:41,041
Or let your father's lies consume you.

661
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:46,958
It's on you, mate.

662
01:03:52,375 --> 01:03:54,458
[voice breaking]
He wasn't always like this.

663
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:01,625
I'm sorry.

664
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:04,125
- Nah, it's okay.
- No.

665
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:06,875

- We gotta move.
- What's going on?

671

They found us.

672

Take the elevator down.
Walk calmly out the front door.

673
01:05:01,916 --> 01:05:05,125
I'll get to the garage,

[door squeaks softly]

968
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:21,958
[in English] Put the gun down.
Put the gun down.

969
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:26,625
Oh, you can exact retribution
for your brother,

970
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,666
but it will be at the cost
of <i>his </i>life right now.

971
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:32,166
So put the gun down!

972
01:41:34,791 --> 01:41:37,125
[in French]
I'm going to blow his asshole face off.

973
01:41:38,583 --> 01:41:39,791
[Tyler, in English] Nik,

974
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:42,125
the boy.

975
01:41:43,208 --> 01:41:44,250
[breathes heavily]

976
01:41:57,583 --> 01:41:58,583
Good girl.

977
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:00,125
Fuck you.

978
01:42:05,875 --> 01:42:07,666
[both grunt]

979
01:42:08,916 --> 01:42:09,916
[groans]

980
01:42:12,416 --> 01:42:14,000
[both grunting]

981
01:42:31,625 --> 01:42:33,208
- [straining]

01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:43,041
[yelling]

984
01:42:47,125 --> 01:42:48,416
[Tyler groans]

985
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:50,458
[bomb beeping]

986
01:42:54,541 --> 01:42:56,750

01:43:12,541 --> 01:43:14,041
- [yells]
- [Tyler screams]

988
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:29,875
[Nik groans]

989
01:43:35,416 --> 01:43:36,583
[beeping continues]

990
01:43:39,541 --> 01:43:41,500
[Tyler grunting]

991
01:43:43,833 --> 01:43:44,833
[grunts]

992
01:43:47,625 --> 01:43:48,750
I'm... I'm sorry.

993
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:50,750
I'm so sorry.

994
01:44:00,125 --> 01:44:01,125
[grunts]

995
01:44:02,125 --> 01:44:03,541
[grunts, groans]

996
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:05,041
[panting]

997
01:44:10,083 --> 01:44:11,416
[screaming]

998
01:44:31,916 --> 01:44:33,916
[both panting]

999
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:47,041
I will not...

1000
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:49,000
stop.

1001
01:47:22,208 --> 01:47:24,500
- Hey.
- Hey.

1002
01:47:24,583 --> 01:47:25,583
How are they?

1003
01:47:26,125 --> 01:47:27,708
Good. Safe.

1004
01:47:28,708 --> 01:47:30,291
They're in witness protection.

1005
01:47:30,375 --> 01:47:33,000
I helped her broker a deal
with the Americans.

1006
01:47:33,083 --> 01:47:36,625
She gave them trade routes,
bank accounts, names.

1007
01:47:37,500 --> 01:47:41,333
The Americans froze their assets though.
Took it all.

1008
01:47:42,291 --> 01:47:45,291
If you go to my cabin in the third
floorboard back from the fireplace,

1009
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:47,958
there's a million in cash.
You can give it to them.

1010
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:56,583
I... I came here because I wanted...

1011
01:47:56,666 --> 01:47:57,791
Thank you, Mia.

1012
01:48:00,041 --> 01:48:01,375
I know, I never said that.

1013
01:48:01,458 --> 01:48:04,666
I never said "thank you"
for doing what I... couldn't.

1014
01:48:11,250 --> 01:48:14,208
His last image of you
wasn't you walking out on him.

1015
01:48:15,375 --> 01:48:17,791
It was you going off to save people.

1016
01:48:20,208 --> 01:48:22,750
And he was so brave, Tyler, when it ended.

1017
01:48:24,166 --> 01:48:27,875
He said, "I want to be brave like Dad."

1018
01:48:37,041 --> 01:48:38,750
That's how he saw you.

1019
01:48:47,625 --> 01:48:48,708
Goodbye, Tyler.

1020
01:49:47,541 --> 01:49:50,750
[man] It's like the goddamn
<i>Sound of Music </i>out here. Isn't it?

1021
01:49:56,958 --> 01:49:58,333
Told you not to get caught.

1022
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Shit happens, eh?

1023
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,416
What if I could get you out?

1024
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:04,250
How does that work?

1025
01:50:05,041 --> 01:50:06,916
Come and do another job for us.

1026
01:50:07,791 --> 01:50:10,166
Not without my team.
I'm not leaving her behind.

1027
01:50:10,250 --> 01:50:11,250
[chuckles]

1028
01:50:11,833 --> 01:50:13,791
Yeah. Thought you might say that.

1029
01:50:13,875 --> 01:50:14,875
[car approaching]

1030
01:50:34,625 --> 01:50:35,625
[man] Rake.

1031
01:50:36,125 --> 01:50:39,083
Rake. That's such a fun name to say.

1032
01:50:39,916 --> 01:50:42,333
You never told me your name.
Is it as much fun?

1033
01:50:43,166 --> 01:50:44,375
My name doesn't matter.

1034
01:50:44,458 --> 01:50:45,875
Yeah? What does?

1035
01:50:46,541 --> 01:50:47,750
Who I work for.

1036
01:50:48,583 --> 01:50:49,791
Who's that?

1037
01:50:50,375 --> 01:50:52,208
A gnarly motherfucker.

1038
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:55,750
You'll love him.
