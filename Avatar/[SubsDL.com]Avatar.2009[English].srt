1
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:42,042
<i>When I was lying there
in the VA hospital,</i>

2
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,671
<i>with a big hole blown
through the middle of my life,</i>

3
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,716
<i>I started having
these dreams of flying.</i>

4
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:51,301
<i>I was free.</i>

5
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:58,518
<i>Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.</i>

6
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:15,409
<i>In cryo, you don't
dream at all.</i>

7
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,371
<i>It doesn't feel
like six years.</i>

8
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,500
<i>More like a fifth of tequila
and an ass-kicking.</i>

9
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,009
<i>Tommy was the scientist, not me.</i>

10
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:33,552
<i>He was the one who wanted to
get shot light-years out in space</i>

11
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,388
<i>to find the answers.</i>

12
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,472
Are we there yet?

13
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,600
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

14
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:41,561
We're there.

15
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:42,978
<i>It's about your brother.</i>

16
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:50,986
<i>So, a week before Tommy's gonna ship
out, a guy with a gun ends his journey</i>

17
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,115
<i>for the paper in his wallet.</i>

18
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,536
You've been in cryo for five years,
nine months and 22 days.

19
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:01,414
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

20
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:04,000
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks...

21
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,168
<i>Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.</i>

22
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,838
<i>Me, I'm just another dumb grunt
going someplace he's gonna regret.</i>

23
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,937
<i>Up ahead was Pandora.</i>

24
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:31,818
<i>You grew up hearing about it, but
I never figured I'd be going there.</i>

25
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:43,747
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

26
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,668
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

27
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:52,715
And since your genome is identical
to his, you could step into his shoes,

28
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:55,093
so to speak.

29
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,850
<i>It'd be a fresh start
on a new world.</i>

30
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:13,068
<i>And the pay is good.</i>

31
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,780
Very good.

32
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:40,847
- Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!
- Exo-packs on! Let's go!

33
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:42,389
Remember, people,
you lose that mask,

34
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,018
you're unconscious in 20 seconds,
you're dead in four minutes!

35
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:47,645
Let's nobody be dead today!

36
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,479
Looks very bad on my report.

37
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,776
Hell's Gate tower, this
is TAV 1-6 on approach.

38
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,944
Crossing outer marker.
Mine is in sight.

39
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,358
<i>One life ends,</i>

40
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,903
<i>another begins.</i>

41
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,413
Harnesses off!
Get your packs!

42
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:49,790
- Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
- Harnesses off! One minute!

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,920
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

44
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,382
Go straight inside.
Wait for my mark!

45
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,100
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

46
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,690
<i>There's no such thing
as an ex-Marine.</i>

47
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,237
<i>You may be out, but you
never lose the attitude.</i>

48
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:23,115
<i>I told myself I could pass
any test a man could pass.</i>

49
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:30,790
<i>They can fix a spinal,
if you got the money,</i>

50
00:05:30,915 --> 00:05:34,334
<i>but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy.</i>

51
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,255
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

52
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,591
Well, well, ladies.

53
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:45,012
Look at all this fresh meat!

54
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:53,603
<i>Back on Earth, these guys
were Army dogs, Marines,</i>

55
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,730
<i>fighting for freedom.</i>

56
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,990
<i>Look out, hot rod!</i>

57
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,742
<i>But out here
they're just hired guns,</i>

58
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:09,704
<i>taking the money,
working for the company.</i>

59
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:11,622
Check this out, man.

60
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,665
Meals on wheels.

61
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,752
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

62
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,422
I got two guys free
in about 20 minutes!

63
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:21,673
Got it! Need them!

64
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:32,768
<i>You're not in Kansas anymore.</i>

65
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:37,564
You are on Pandora,
ladies and gentlemen.

66
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:43,028
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

67
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,199
If there is a hell,

68
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,913
you might want to go there for
some R&R after a tour on Pandora.

69
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,372
Out there,
beyond that fence,

70
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:59,461
every living thing that crawls,
flies or squats in the mud

71
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:03,214
wants to kill you and
eat your eyes for Jujubes.

72
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:09,430
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

73
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,807
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

74
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,435
that'll stop your heart
in one minute.

75
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:19,523
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

76
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,483
They are very hard to kill.

77
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,362
As head of security,

78
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:27,238
it is my job to keep you alive.

79
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,951
I will not succeed.

80
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,329
Not with all of you.

81
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,040
If you wish to survive,

82
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:40,168
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

83
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,463
You've got to obey the rules.

84
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,966
Pandora rules.

85
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,052
Rule number one...

86
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:53,432
<i>There's nothing like an old-school
safety brief to put your mind at ease.</i>

87
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,103
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!

88
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,146
You're Jake, right?

89
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,064
Tom's brother.

90
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,401
Wow! You lookjust like him.

91
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:07,278
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman. lwent
through avatar training with him.

92
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,406
...into the
bio-lab.

93
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,617
We're gonna spend
a lot of time up here.

94
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,577
Hey! How you doing?
Norm, avatar driver.

95
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:15,913
- Hi.
- Hey.

96
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:20,209
Link... Here's the link room right here. This
is where we're connecting to the avatar.

97
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:27,091
<i>Me and Norm are here to drive these
remotely controlled bodies called avatars.</i>

98
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:32,178
<i>And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.</i>

99
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,347
- Hey. Welcome.
- Hey.

100
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,018
- Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.
- Thanks.

101
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,604
Damn! They got big.

102
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:43,274
Yeah, they fully mature
on the flight out.

103
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:45,567
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

104
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,610
Yeah, they've got
great muscle tone.

105
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,404
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

106
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:51,157
but you guys can take
them out tomorrow.

107
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,325
There's yours.

108
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:56,578
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

109
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,623
- Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
- Good to meet you, yeah.

110
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,024
Looks like him.

111
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,943
No, it looks like you.

112
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,489
This is your
avatar now, Jake.

113
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:39,413
<i>And the concept is that every driver
is matched to his own avatar,</i>

114
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,165
so that their nervous
systems are in tune,

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,543
or something.

116
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,421
Which is why they offered me the gig,

117
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:50,381
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

118
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,885
which is insanely expensive.

119
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:57,472
Is this right? I just say
whatever to the video log?

120
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,682
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

121
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,812
You know, what we see, what
we feel. It's all part of the science.

122
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:04,647
And good science
is good observation.

123
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:07,107
Plus it'll help to keep you
sane for the next six years.

124
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,485
All right. Whatever.

125
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,738
So...

126
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,075
Well, here I am,

127
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,078
doing science.

128
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,913
They're coming out!

129
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,582
<i>Attention. Drivers
coming out of link.</i>

130
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,424
Oh, God.

131
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:36,971
Where's the lab coat?
Where's the lab coat?

132
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:39,639
Who's got my
goddamn cigarette?

133
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,475
Guys!

134
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:44,352
What's wrong with this picture?

135
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,687
Thank you!

136
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,648
Grace Augustine
is a legend.

137
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:50,525
She's the head of the Avatar
Program. She wrote the book,

138
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:53,278
I mean, literally wrote the
book on Pandoran botany.

139
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,739
Well, that's 'cause she likes
plants better than people.

140
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,075
Here she is, Cinderella
back from the ball.

141
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,660
Grace, I'd like you to
meet Norm Spellman

142
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,078
and Jake Sully.

143
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,042
Norm. I hear good things
about you. How's your Na'vi?

144
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,671
May the. A" Mother"---...

145
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,881
...smilc upon our First meeting.

146
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:16,092
Not bad.
You sound a little Formal.

147
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,554
I studied For Five Hears...

148
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,764
“but there is much to learn.

149
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,518
Grace? This
is Jake Sully.

150
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,811
Ma'am.

151
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,313
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,
and I don't need you.

152
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,648
I need your brother.

153
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:32,192
You know, the PhD who trained

154
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,735
for three years for this mission?

155
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:37,865
He's dead. I know it's a big
inconvenience for everyone.

156
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,076
How much lab training have you had?

157
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,912
I dissected a frog once.

158
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:44,663
You see?

159
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,207
You see? I mean,
they're just pissing on us

160
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,918
without even the courtesy
of calling it rain.

161
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,336
- I'm going to Selfridge.
- No, Grace,

162
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:53,880
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- No, man, this is such bullshit!

163
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,090
I'm gonna kick
his corporate butt.

164
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,259
He has no business sticking
his nose in my department.

165
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:02,764
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

166
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:15,068
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.

167
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,489
Hover taxi, Delta
runway. Squawk ident.

168
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:25,120
- You see that?
- Yes, sir.

169
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,705
No, you didn't. You were
looking at the monitor.

170
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,749
I love this putter, Ronnie!

171
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,000
I love this putter.

172
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:37,383
Parker, you know, I used to
think it was benign neglect,

173
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:40,385
but now I see that you're
intentionally screwing me.

174
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:44,181
Grace, you know,
I enjoy our little talks.

175
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:51,772
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

176
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,649
Well, actually, I thought
we got lucky with him.

177
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,234
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

178
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,278
How is this in any way lucky?

179
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,196
Lucky your guy
had a twin brother,

180
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:02,198
and lucky that brother wasn't
some oral hygienist or something.

181
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,077
A Marine we can use. I'm assigning
him to your team as security escort.

182
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:09,664
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there!

183
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,750
Look, look, you're supposed to be winning
the hearts and the minds of the natives.

184
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,711
Isn't that the whole point
of your little puppet show?

185
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,048
If you look like them and you talk
like them, then they'll start trusting us.

186
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,091
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

187
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,219
but after, what, how many years?

188
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:23,803
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

189
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,597
Yeah, that tends to happen when
you use machine guns on them.

190
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,643
Right. Come here.

191
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,145
I can't...
I can't...

192
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:38,818
This is why we're
here. Unobtanium.

193
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,572
Because this little gray rock
sells for 20 million a kilo.

194
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:44,866
That's the only reason. It's
what pays for the whole party.

195
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,951
It's what pays for your science.

196
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,331
Now, those savages are
threatening our whole operation,

197
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,665
we're on the brink of war,

198
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,128
and you're supposed to be
finding a diplomatic solution.

199
00:13:56,128 --> 00:14:00,256
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

200
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:15,147
- So, how much link time have you logged?
- About 520 hours.

201
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,356
That's good.

202
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,317
You're in there.

203
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:21,903
- You're here. How much have you logged?
- Zip.

204
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,822
But I read a manual.

205
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:26,075
Tell me you're joking.

206
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,327
This is cool.

207
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,580
Let's go.

208
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,336
Don't.
I got this.

209
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,716
So you just figured
you'd come out here,

210
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:47,053
to the most hostile
environment known to man,

211
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,432
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

212
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,975
What was going through your head?

213
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:56,855
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

214
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,607
- Biometrics are good.
- Link three is ready.

215
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,652
Keep your arms in, hands in,

216
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,114
head down.

217
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:09,033
Down. Just relax and
let your mind go blank.

218
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,285
That shouldn't
be hard for you.

219
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,621
Kiss the darkest part
of my lily white...

220
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,039
Initiate link.

221
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,251
Run sequence
unit three. Go.

222
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,961
Launching.

223
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:26,927
I have the first congruency.

224
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:37,895
That's a gorgeous
brain. Nice activity.

225
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,399
Go figure.

226
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,650
Phase-lock 40%.

227
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:49,073
All right. Going in.

228
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,868
I'm going in in four.

229
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,414
Phase-lock 99%.
Link is stable.

230
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,681
He's in.

231
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:16,184
Jake, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Jake?

232
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,604
Pupillary reflex
is good.

233
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,442
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

234
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,320
Hey, guys.

235
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,447
Welcome to your
new body, Jake.

236
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,323
Good!

237
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,033
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

238
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,076
- And touch your thumb to your fingers.
- Yeah.

239
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:35,703
- Thumb to your fingers.
- No problem.

240
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,371
That's good. I can see
you can remember that one.

241
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,625
- Got it.
- Well, if you want to sit up,

242
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:40,959
-that's fine.
- Okay, good. Just take it

243
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,046
nice and slow, Jake. Good. Okay,
well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

244
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,215
Are you feeling lightheaded
or dizzy at all?

245
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,633
You're wiggling your toes!

246
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:49,927
- Good. Good, Jake.
- That's great.

247
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:54,056
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

248
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,767
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

249
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,937
That's great, Jake.
Hold on, now.

250
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,480
Take it easy. Don't get
ahead of yourself, okay?

251
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,357
There's a few more sensory
motor reflex tests we need to run,

252
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,276
-so take it easy.
- Wait.

253
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,153
- Jake.
- Sit down, Jake.

254
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,278
Jake! Listen to me.

255
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,824
- Jake! I need you to sit down. Jake!
-It's okay.

256
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,035
- Buddy, listen to me.
-It's all good. I got this.

257
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:16,953
Jake, you need to
sit down right now.

258
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,622
Guys, get him back
on the gurney now.

259
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,707
Listen to me. For your own
safety, you need to sit down.

260
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,626
You need time to adjust to
the avatar... Whoa! Jake!

261
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,711
- God, Jake, watch your tail.
- Yeah!

262
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,423
Sedate! Sedate him! A thousand
milligrams of Supitocam! Stat!

263
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:32,469
Guys! Guys!
Whoa! Whoa!

264
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:33,595
<i>By the numbers.</i>

265
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:35,221
- Jake. Come on.
- Jake! Listen to me.

266
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,682
You're not used to
your avatar body.

267
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,517
<i>- This is dangerous.
- This</i> is <i>great.</i>

268
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:41,060
<i>- Jake? Jake, listen to me.
- Come on. They're</i> gonna <i>put you out.</i>

269
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,025
- Norm, sit down.
- No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

270
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,443
God damn it! Bring them home!

271
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,029
- Norm! Do not leave control!
- You're not ready for it!

272
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:56,951
- Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.
- So close!

273
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,787
I don't even have to
play defense on it.

274
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,329
Hey, guys. Hey.

275
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,664
It's okay,
I'll get him.

276
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:02,833
Jake, you have to come back!

277
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,835
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

278
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,797
- Watch it!
- Sorry!

279
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,257
Come on!

280
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,137
Jake! We're not
supposed to be running!

281
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:25,188
Jeez! Sorry.

282
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,856
<i>Watch it!</i>

283
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,086
Hey, Marine!

284
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,339
Damn.

285
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,471
- Grace?
- Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

286
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,765
Think fast.

287
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,518
Motor control's looking good.

288
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,113
Come on, everybody, quiet down!

289
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,907
All right, gang,
lights out.

290
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,492
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

291
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,369
Hey, hey, hey!

292
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,913
Don't play with that,
you'll go blind.

293
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,790
That's kind of freaky.

294
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,000
Come on. Scat.

295
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,420
Good night.

296
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,592
Lights out! See you
at dinner, kiddies.

297
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,366
Welcome back.

298
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,459
You okay? You all right?

299
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,127
Yeah, I'm okay.

300
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,422
<i>I'm Trudy.</i>

301
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:17,634
I fly all the science sorties.
And this here is my baby.

302
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,136
Hold on a second.

303
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,847
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

304
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:27,102
- We bounce at zero-nine.
- Yeah, I'm on it, <i>capitaine!</i>

305
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,355
Vine strike's still loose.

306
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,606
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

307
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,151
Watch it!

308
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,362
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not the
only thing flying around out there.

309
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,239
Or the biggest.

310
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,159
I'm gonna need you on a
door gun. I'm a man short.

311
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,661
I thought you'd never ask.

312
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,329
There's your man.

313
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,249
See you on the flight line.

314
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:01,260
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

315
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,513
This low gravity'll
make you soft.

316
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,726
You get soft,

317
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:14,607
Pandora will shit you out
dead with zero warning.

318
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,527
I pulled your record, Corporal.

319
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:20,404
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

320
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,742
Nothing like this here, though.

321
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:29,413
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

322
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,833
I figured it's just
another hellhole.

323
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,294
I was First Recon myself.

324
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,507
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

325
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,550
Three tours Nigeria,
not a scratch.

326
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,302
I come out here?

327
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:48,057
Day one. Think I felt
like a shavetail louie?

328
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,102
Yeah. Oh, they could fix
me up, if I rotated back.

329
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,815
Yeah, and make me pretty again.

330
00:21:54,815 --> 00:21:57,483
But you know what?
I kind of like it.

331
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,193
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

332
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:04,990
The Avatar Program
is a bad joke.

333
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,411
Bunch of limp-dick
science majors.

334
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:12,624
However, it does present an opportunity

335
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:15,460
both timely and unique.

336
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,671
- Clear!
- Clear!

337
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:27,556
A recon gyrene in an avatar
body. That's a potent mix.

338
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:30,683
Give me the goose bumps.
Such a Marine

339
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,563
could provide the intel I need,
right on the ground.

340
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,273
Right in the hostiles' camp.

341
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:41,443
Look, Sully. I want you

342
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:45,490
to learn these savages from the inside.
I want you to gain their trust.

343
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,491
I need to know how to
force their cooperation

344
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,327
or hammer them
hard if they won't.

345
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,498
- Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

346
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:58,377
Yeah, you walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,

347
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,506
but you report to me.

348
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:03,758
Can you do that for me, son?

349
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:07,596
Hell, yeah, sir.

350
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,598
Well, all right, then.

351
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,944
Son, I take care of my own.

352
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:28,282
You get me what I need, I'll see to it you
get your legs back when you rotate home.

353
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,536
Your real legs.

354
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,040
That sounds real good, sir.

355
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:45,133
- Link's ready!
- Phase-lock 40%.

356
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:48,677
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

357
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:52,307
I have five congruencies.
Phase-lock 90%.

358
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,308
Link three ready.

359
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,478
All right, I'm going in.

360
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,173
Shut it down. We're
gonna stay a while.

361
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:15,848
- Norm! Your pack.
- Pack.

362
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,227
Stay with the ship.

363
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:21,813
One idiot with a gun is enough.

364
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,567
You the man, Doc.

365
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,521
Prolemuris.

366
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,398
They're not aggressive.

367
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:12,821
Relax, Marine. You're
making me nervous.

368
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:20,329
So, how will they
know we're here?

369
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,083
I'm sure they're
watching us right now.

370
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,753
- Keep moving, Norm.
- Keep up, guys!

371
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:32,717
- And here I go.
- Scanning.

372
00:26:35,845 --> 00:26:38,972
Oh, wow! It's that fast?

373
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,353
- Amazing, isn't it?
- Yeah.

374
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,315
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

375
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:51,027
to the root of the tree next to it.
So, we should take a sample.

376
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:53,070
Okay. Sample.

377
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:58,992
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

378
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:03,580
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

379
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,625
Right.

380
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,445
So, here I go.

381
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,515
Don't shoot.

382
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,767
Don't shoot,
you'll piss him off.

383
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:10,522
It's already pissed off.

384
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,567
Jake, that armor's
too thick. Trust me.

385
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:20,657
It's a territorial threat display.

386
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,036
Do not run,
or he'll charge.

387
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,913
So, what do I do, dance with it?

388
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:28,750
Just hold your ground.

389
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,684
Yeah? Come on!
What you got?

390
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,355
Oh, yeah. Who's
bad? That's right.

391
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,398
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

392
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:57,153
That's right, get your
punk ass back to mommy.

393
00:28:57,153 --> 00:29:00,323
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

394
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:03,284
Yeah, and why don't you bring
back some of your friends, huh?

395
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,413
Oh, shit.

396
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,009
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

397
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:24,763
Run! Definitely run!

398
00:33:11,699 --> 00:33:16,412
I'm gonna have to call it, guys. We're not
allowed to run night ops. Colonel's orders.

399
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,748
<i>I'm sorry, Doc,</i>

400
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:20,708
<i>he's just gonna have to
hang on till morning.</i>

401
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,627
He won't make it till morning.

402
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,242
I don't have all goddamn night.

403
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:20,702
Come on! Come on!

404
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,570
Hey, wait. Don't!

405
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,782
Great.

406
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:42,010
Look, I know you probably
don't understand this,

407
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,309
but thank you.

408
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:55,775
Thank you.

409
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,280
That was pretty impressive.

410
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,827
I would have been screwed if
you hadn't come along. It was...

411
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,541
Hey, wait a second.

412
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:14,126
Hey, where you going?

413
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:15,168
Wait up!

414
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,588
Just... Hey, slow down.

415
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,757
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say
thanks for killing those things.

416
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,260
Damn!

417
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,054
Don't thank.

418
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,724
You don't thank for this.

419
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:33,061
This is sad.

420
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,980
Very sad only.

421
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,275
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

422
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,485
Whatever I did,
I am sorry.

423
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:47,242
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

424
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:49,786
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

425
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:52,039
- Your fault!
- Whoa!

426
00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:55,458
- Your fault!
- Easy. Easy.

427
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,211
You're like a baby. Making noise,
don't know what to do.

428
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,380
Easy.

429
00:39:02,215 --> 00:39:03,384
Fine.

430
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,510
Fine.

431
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,304
If you love your
little forest friends,

432
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,351
why not let them
just kill my ass?

433
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:13,936
What's the thinking?

434
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:16,313
Why save you?

435
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:18,065
Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

436
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,280
You have a strong heart.

437
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,449
No fear.

438
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:35,498
But stupid!
Ignorant like a child.

439
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:44,340
Well, if I'm like
a child, then...

440
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,635
Look, maybe you should teach me.

441
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:49,387
Sky People cannot learn.
You do not See.

442
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,889
Well, then teach me how to See.

443
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,976
- No one can teach you to See.
- Whoa.

444
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:57,478
Look, come on,
can't we talk?

445
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:02,483
Say, where'd you learn to speak
English? Dr. Augustine's school?

446
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,532
You're like a baby.

447
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:16,916
I need your help.

448
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,335
You should not be here.

449
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,380
- Okay, take me with you.
- No! Go back.

450
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:26,550
No.

451
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,137
Go back.

452
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,534
No!

453
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,224
What...

454
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,478
What are they?

455
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,648
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

456
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:26,860
Very pure spirits.

457
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,927
What was that all about?

458
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,639
Come.

459
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,766
Come!

460
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,186
Where are we going?

461
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:12,864
Come.

462
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:19,163
What's your name?

463
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:20,956
Shit!

464
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,150
Okay.

465
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:53,405
Calm People, calm.

466
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,954
What are Hou doing, Tswtcg?

467
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:07,418
These demons are Forbidden here-.

468
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:10,463
There has been a sign.

469
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,840
This is a matter For the Tsahik.

470
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:18,639
Bring him.

471
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,141
What's going on?

472
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:25,686
Wait.

473
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:29,690
What's happening?

474
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:31,652
Hey!

475
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:43,181
Father...

476
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:45,851
---I sec 501.1-.

477
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,030
This creature...

478
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:02,409
- ~~Wh9 do Hou bring him here?

479
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,204
I was going to kill him...

480
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:07,331
“but there was a sign From Egwa.

481
00:45:07,456 --> 00:45:09,541
I have said...

482
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:12,251
...HO drcamwalkcr COITKi here.

483
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:13,085
What's he saying?

484
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,465
His alien smell Fills m9 nose.

485
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:19,842
- Hey, what's he saying?
- My father is deciding whether to kill you.

486
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,681
Your father.
It's nice to meet you, sir.

487
00:45:28,143 --> 00:45:29,603
Step back!

488
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:35,192
I will look at this alien.

489
00:45:35,192 --> 00:45:38,110
<i>That is Mother.
She is Tsahik.</i>

490
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,780
The one who interprets
the will of Eywa.

491
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:42,699
Who's Eywa?

492
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:51,625
What are you called?

493
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,710
Jake Sully.

494
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,846
Why did you come to us?

495
00:46:05,514 --> 00:46:06,764
I came to learn.

496
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:10,686
We have tried to teach
other Sky People.

497
00:46:10,686 --> 00:46:14,690
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

498
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:18,402
Well, my cup is
empty, trust me.

499
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:21,445
Just ask Dr. Augustine.
I'm no scientist.

500
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,532
What are you?

501
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:28,829
I was a Marine. A...

502
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:32,916
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

503
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:34,208
A warrior!

504
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,793

505
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,086
Icould him casilg!

506
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:41,717
This is the First warrior drcamwalkcr...

<i>...W€ have</i> 566T] .

508
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:46,596
We need to learn more about him.

509
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:50,934
My Daughter...

510
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:55,313
“-5014 teach him our wag---...

511
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:58,775
...to speak and walk as we do.

512
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:02,445
Why me'? That's not Fair...

513
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,405
It is decided.

514
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,744
My daughter will teach you
our ways. Learn well,

515
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:10,954
Jakesully.

516
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:16,083
Then we will see if your
insanity can be cured.

517
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:36,271
Good evening.

518
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,983
Please don't get up.

519
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:43,027
Excuse me.

520
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:46,782
Sorry.

521
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,079
Hey, how you doing?

522
00:48:35,664 --> 00:48:37,873
<i>- Jake. Jake!
- He's in alpha.</i>

523
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,208
He's coming out right now.

524
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,585
Jake.Jake!

525
00:48:42,838 --> 00:48:46,257
Come on back, kid.
Come on. That's it.

526
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:50,344
There you go. There you go, there you go.

527
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,806
You're okay. You're okay.

528
00:48:52,806 --> 00:48:55,766
Damn! You were
dug in like a tick.

529
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,148
- Is the avatar safe?
- Yeah, Doc.

530
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,775
And you are not gonna
believe where I am.

531
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:09,322
The last thing we see
is this Marine's ass

532
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:12,284
disappearing into the brush with
this angry thanator coming after him.

533
00:49:13,452 --> 00:49:16,413
- Hey, it's not something you can teach.
- That is awesome.

534
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:21,126
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,
the Omaticaya have chosen you.

535
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:22,418
God help us all.

536
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,838
"Jarhead clan"?

537
00:49:26,755 --> 00:49:28,007
And it worked?

538
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,509
Hey, I'm
practically family.

539
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:34,389
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.

540
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:37,391
That's called taking the initiative,
son. lwish I had 10 more like you.

541
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:42,271
Look, Sully. Sully. Just find out
what the blue monkeys want.

542
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:44,398
You know, I mean,
we try to give them

543
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:48,652
medicine, education, roads.

544
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,155
But no, no, no, they like mud.

545
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:54,742
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're...

546
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:57,286
Hey, can you... Can somebodyjust...

547
00:49:57,286 --> 00:49:58,746
Sector 12.

548
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,376
Go: go! go'
stop. Stop...

549
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:05,336
Rich, stop!
That's... Jesus!

550
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:08,047
Their damn village
happens to be resting

551
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:11,510
on the richest
unobtanium deposit

552
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:15,137
within 200 klicks in
any direction. I mean,

553
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,181
look at all that cheddar!

554
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,228
Well, who gets them
to move?

555
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,396
Guess.

556
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:27,150
What if they won't go?

557
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:29,777
Oh, I'm betting that they will.

558
00:50:29,777 --> 00:50:32,614
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, hey. Look. Look.

559
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:34,740
Killing the indigenous
looks bad,

560
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:37,786
but there's one thing
that shareholders hate

561
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:39,246
more than
bad press,

562
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,164
and that's a bad
quarterly statement.

563
00:50:41,289 --> 00:50:42,541
I didn't make up the rules.

564
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:45,918
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

565
00:50:46,545 --> 00:50:49,672
otherwise it's gonna have
to be all stick. Okay?

566
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,969
You got three months. That's
when the 'dozers get there.

567
00:50:53,969 --> 00:50:56,137
Well, we're wasting time.

568
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,431
I like this guy.

569
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,226
- Guys, right now...
- Okay, let's run through them again.

570
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:02,851
<i>Mo' at.</i>

571
00:51:03,353 --> 00:51:04,813
Dragon lady.

572
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:08,400
- Eytucan.
- Eytukan.

573
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,445
He's the clan leader. But she's
the spiritual leader. Like a shaman.

574
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:13,280
Got it.

575
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,449
- T'su'tey.
- Tsu'tey.

576
00:51:16,449 --> 00:51:19,369
- Tsu'tey.
- He'll be the next clan leader.

577
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:22,371
Neytiri.

578
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:25,708
She'll be the next Tsahik.
They become a mated pair.

579
00:51:26,668 --> 00:51:27,918
So who's this Eywa?

580
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,378
Who's Eywa?

581
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,172
Only their deity.

582
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:34,800
Their goddess, made up of all
living things. Everything they know!

583
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,344
You'd know this if you had
any training whatsoever.

584
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,929
Who's got a date with
the chief's daughter?

585
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,599
- Come on. That's...
- All right, knock it off, you two.

586
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:41,807
Let's go. Village
life starts early.

587
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:47,856
Don't do anything
unusually stupid.

588
00:52:06,708 --> 00:52:08,293
Easy, DOV-

589
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:10,878
Pale is female.

590
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,175
Okay.

591
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,510
Easy, girl.

592
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:47,956
<i>That</i> is <i>tsaheylu.</i>

593
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:49,291
The bond.

594
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,503
Feelhen

595
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,425
Feel her heartbeat.

596
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,469
Her breath.

597
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,264
Feel her strong legs.

598
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,436
You may tell her
what to do.

599
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:10,230
Inside.

600
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,606
For now,

601
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:14,900
say where to go.

602
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,862
Forward!

603
00:53:36,047 --> 00:53:38,132
You should go away.

604
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,509
No, you'd miss me.

605
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,804
I knew you could speak English.

606
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,766
This alien will learn nothing...

607
00:53:48,184 --> 00:53:49,853
“.8 FOCk S665 more...

608
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:52,105
...lool< at him.

609
00:54:01,197 --> 00:54:02,489
Again.

610
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,869
If you want to hit this thing,
it's gonna be complicated.

611
00:54:05,869 --> 00:54:08,036
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

612
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:10,581
There's an outer
row of columns.

613
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:14,753
Real heavy duty. There's a secondary
ring here, and an inner ring.

614
00:54:14,753 --> 00:54:20,215
There's a core structure like a spiral.
That's how they move up and down.

615
00:54:20,215 --> 00:54:22,427
We're gonna need accurate
scans on every column.

616
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:23,762
Roger that.

617
00:54:23,762 --> 00:54:26,472
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

618
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:28,891
I'm guessing this
secondary ring,

619
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:29,768
that's also load-bearing.

620
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:36,231
So where are we going?

621
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,777
Getting out of Dodge.

622
00:54:38,902 --> 00:54:42,697
I'm not about to let Selfridge and
Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

623
00:54:43,782 --> 00:54:47,994
There's a mobile link up at Site 26 we can
work out of, way up in the mountains.

624
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:51,039
The Hallelujah Mountains?

625
00:54:51,623 --> 00:54:53,875
- That's right.
- Are you serious?

626
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,043
- Yeah.
- Yes!

627
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:03,384
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora. Heard of them?

628
00:55:16,648 --> 00:55:19,025
We're getting close.

629
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:20,860
Yeah, look at
my instruments.

630
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,239
Yep. We're in
the Flux Vortex.

631
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:26,657
We're VFR
from here on.

632
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,492
What's VF R?

633
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,954
Means you gotta see
where you're going.

634
00:55:31,079 --> 00:55:32,789
You can't see anything.

635
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:35,791
Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

636
00:55:53,476 --> 00:55:56,646
Oh, my God.

637
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:08,824
You should see your faces.

638
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,688
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

639
00:56:56,664 --> 00:56:58,291
Welcome to camp.

640
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,253
So,

641
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:05,547
this is my bunk.

642
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,090
This stuff is nasty.

643
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,052
- Norm, go under.
- All right.

644
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,512
<i>- Grace didn't miss</i> a <i>thing.
- Trudy, you'll</i> take <i>the top one.</i>

645
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:16,099
<i>She knew I was talking
to the Colonel.</i>

646
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,811
<i>But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,</i>

647
00:57:19,938 --> 00:57:22,065
<i>so she's playing nice.</i>

648
00:57:22,065 --> 00:57:25,193
All right. Jake, hang a left.

649
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:27,695
You'll be in the
link at the end.

650
00:57:29,072 --> 00:57:30,322
Unit one.

651
00:57:31,032 --> 00:57:34,869
Beulah. She's
the least glitchy.

652
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,960
Holy shit!

653
00:58:25,128 --> 00:58:26,628
Do not look in her eye.

654
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,347
Ikran is not horse.

655
00:58:38,391 --> 00:58:40,809
<i>Once tsaheylu is made,</i>

656
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:48,443
ikran will fly with only one
hunter in the whole life.

657
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:01,289
<i>To become taronyu, hunter,</i>

658
00:59:01,289 --> 00:59:05,835
you must choose your own ikran
and he must choose you.

659
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,630
- When?
- When you are ready.

660
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,306
Okay.

661
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,893
This is video log 12.

662
01:00:04,018 --> 01:00:06,561
Time's 2132.

663
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:10,608
Do I have to do this now?
I really need to get some rack.

664
01:00:10,733 --> 01:00:14,070
No, now.
When it's fresh.

665
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:18,907
Okay, location, shack,

666
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,744
and the days are starting
to blur together.

667
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,083
<i>The language is a
pain, but, you know,</i>

668
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:29,418
<i>I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Just repetition, repetition.</i>

669
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,878
<i>- Na vi.
-"Nari. "</i>

670
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,965
<i>- Nari.
-"Narrri"!</i>

671
01:00:33,965 --> 01:00:35,675
<i>Narrri!</i>

672
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,552
<i>Txur ni'ul. Stronger.</i>

673
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:47,144
<i>Neytiri calls me skxawng.
It means moron.</i>

674
01:00:48,855 --> 01:00:50,313
This is a very
important part of it.

675
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,108
<i>Norm's attitude
has improved lately.</i>

676
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:54,025
- I see you. I see you.
- But it's not just,

677
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,862
"I'm seeing you in front of me,"
it's "I see into you. I See you."

678
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:59,574
<i>It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.</i>

679
01:00:59,574 --> 01:01:02,117
"I'm accepting you. I understand you."
So you gotta get this, okay?

680
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:05,454
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

681
01:01:05,913 --> 01:01:08,708
<i>My feet are
getting tougher.</i>

682
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:11,626
<i>I can run farther
every day.</i>

683
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:14,213
<i>I have to trust my body
to know what to do.</i>

684
01:01:19,635 --> 01:01:21,429
Yeah! Check it out!

685
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:23,222
Oh, crap!

686
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:32,523
<i>Every day it's reading the trails,
the tracks at the waterhole,</i>

687
01:01:32,648 --> 01:01:35,108
<i>the tiniest scents and sounds.</i>

688
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:43,034
<i>She's always going on
about the flow of energy,</i>

689
01:01:43,034 --> 01:01:45,994
<i>the spirits of animals.</i>

690
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:48,664
<i>I really hope this tree-hugger
crap isn't on the final.</i>

691
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:52,501
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there, you know.

692
01:01:52,501 --> 01:01:55,170
You need to listen to what she says.

693
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:58,340
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

694
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:01,635
Excuse me.
This is my video log here.

695
01:02:16,943 --> 01:02:20,237
<i>With Neytiri, it's
learn fast or die.</i>

696
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:21,947
You gotta be kidding me.

697
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,896
<i>I talked Mo 'at into letting
Grace into the village.</i>

698
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:56,606
Look how biggou are.

699
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,650
<i>It's the first time since
her school was closed down.</i>

700
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:59,485
You are <i>so</i> Prcttg.

701
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:03,322
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, you don't.
Come back here.

702
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:06,826
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

703
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,771
Come on, Marine.

704
01:04:01,422 --> 01:04:06,427
<i>I'm trying to understand this deep
connection the people have to the forest.</i>

705
01:04:06,427 --> 01:04:09,597
<i>She talks about a network of energy</i>

706
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,559
<i>that flows through all living things.</i>

707
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:17,646
<i>She says all energy
is only borrowed,</i>

708
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:21,317
<i>and one day you have to give it back.</i>

709
01:04:43,505 --> 01:04:44,672

Wand thankgou.

712
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:54,557
Your spirit goes with Egwa.

713
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,936
Your body 51:22:55 behind---...

714
01:04:57,228 --> 01:04:59,938
...to become Part 0F The People.

715
01:05:03,442 --> 01:05:05,443
A clean kill.

716
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:09,989
You are ready.

717
01:05:35,349 --> 01:05:36,641
<i>Learning to ride an 'man,</i>

718
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:41,063
<i>we call them banshees, is the test
every young hunter has to pass.</i>

719
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:47,820
<i>But to do that, you gotta go
where the banshees are.</i>

720
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,612
<i>Oo-rah.</i>

721
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:21,811
Now what?

722
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:54,237
Jakesully will go first.

723
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:29,189
Now you choose
yourfiaan.

724
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,358
This you must feel inside.

725
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:34,110
If he also chooses you,
move quick like I showed.

726
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:36,904
You will have one chance, Jake.

727
01:08:37,448 --> 01:08:39,574
How will I know
if he chooses me?

728
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:41,702
He will try to kill you.

729
01:08:42,828 --> 01:08:44,496
Outstanding.

730
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,225
Let's dance.

731
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:54,149
That moron's going to die.

732
01:10:17,965 --> 01:10:19,841
Don't be aFraid, warrior.

733
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,217
Make the bond!

734
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,430
No!

735
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:31,060
Jake!

736
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:46,618
<i>Tsaheylu,</i> Jake.

737
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:49,537
<i>Tsaheylu!</i>

738
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:00,923
Stop!

739
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:13,479
Yeah, that's right.
You're mine. Huh?

740
01:11:28,202 --> 01:11:29,703
First flight seals the bond.

741
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:31,497
You cannot wait.

742
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,457
Think, "Fly!"

743
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:35,375
Fly?

744
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:44,717
God damn!

745
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:50,056
Oh, shit!

746
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:01,693
Shut up and fly straight!

747
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:15,332
That's it.
Bank left!

748
01:12:23,841 --> 01:12:26,092
Leveloufl
That's it.

749
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,390
Jakesully!

750
01:12:56,998 --> 01:12:58,166
Hey!

751
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,673
<i>Let's gm!</i>

752
01:13:18,103 --> 01:13:19,813
Yeah, baby, I got this!

753
01:13:20,814 --> 01:13:22,481
Oh, shit!

754
01:13:27,404 --> 01:13:31,365
<i>I may not be much of a horse
guy, but I was born to do this.</i>

755
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:33,493
Yeah!

756
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:37,079
- I came like this. This you.
- Yeah, yeah.

757
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:40,667
I turn. I feel the wind.
I turn very strong.

758
01:13:40,667 --> 01:13:42,461
Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard...

759
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:46,817
<i>The Tree of Souls.</i>

760
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:52,572
It's their most sacred place.

761
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:56,158
See the Flux Vortex in
these false color images?

762
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,743
Yeah, that's what
messes up my instruments.

763
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:02,623
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

764
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,211
I would die
to get samples.

765
01:15:06,336 --> 01:15:08,337
Outsiders are
strictly forbidden.

766
01:15:09,131 --> 01:15:10,841
You lucky swine.

767
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,600
<i>I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.</i>

768
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,185
<i>Death from above.</i>

769
01:15:22,978 --> 01:15:25,521
<i>Only problem is,
you're not the only one.</i>

770
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:30,527
Dive!

771
01:15:54,176 --> 01:15:55,969
Go, go!

772
01:16:02,725 --> 01:16:03,518
Follow me!

773
01:16:50,899 --> 01:16:53,568
Our guys call it a
Great Leonopteryx.

774
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,154
<i>It is Toruk.</i>

775
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,280
Last Shadow.

776
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:00,826
Yeah, right.

777
01:17:00,951 --> 01:17:03,662
It's the last one you ever see.

778
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:11,377
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Macto.

779
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:13,630
Rider of Last Shadow.

780
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:16,716
He rode this?

781
01:17:17,634 --> 01:17:19,469
<i>Toruk chose mm.</i>

782
01:17:19,594 --> 01:17:23,722
It has only happened five times
since the time of the First Songs.

783
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:26,768
- That's a long time.
- Yes.

784
01:17:26,768 --> 01:17:29,104
<i>Toruk Macto was mighty.</i>

785
01:17:29,938 --> 01:17:32,983
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

786
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:36,862
All Na'vi people
know the story.

787
01:17:42,868 --> 01:17:46,037
<i>Everything is backwards now.</i>

788
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:48,206
<i>Like out there is
the true world</i>

789
01:17:48,206 --> 01:17:50,292
<i>and in here is the dream.</i>

790
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,523
<i>It's hard to believe it's
only been three months.</i>

791
01:18:16,568 --> 01:18:19,069
I can barely remember
my old life.

792
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:24,492
I don't know who I am anymore.

793
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:46,055
Haven't gotten lost in
the woods, have you?

794
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:52,229
Your last report was
more than two weeks ago.

795
01:18:54,314 --> 01:18:56,858
I'm starting to doubt
your resolve!

796
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:01,863
The way I see it, it's time
to terminate the mission.

797
01:19:01,988 --> 01:19:03,323
No, I can do this.

798
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:05,617
You already have.

799
01:19:06,493 --> 01:19:11,413
You give me good, usable intel.
This Tree of Souls place.

800
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,792
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that
when this turns into a shit fight,

801
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,711
which it will.
Yeah.

802
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:19,631
Now it's time
to come in.

803
01:19:21,091 --> 01:19:23,009
By the way,

804
01:19:23,467 --> 01:19:26,220
you gonna get your legs back.

805
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:29,724
Yeah. I got your corporate
approval. It's a done deal.

806
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:32,560
Gonna have you
on a shuttle tonight.

807
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,354
I'm a man of my word.

808
01:19:37,274 --> 01:19:39,067
I gotta finish this.

809
01:19:41,278 --> 01:19:42,612
There's one more thing.

810
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:47,701
Ceremony. It's the final stage
of becoming a man.

811
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:53,206
If I do it, I'm one of them.

812
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,376
And they'll trust me.

813
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:03,716
And I can negotiate the
terms of their relocation.

814
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:19,440
Well, then, you'd better
get it done, Corporal.

815
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:40,712
<i>The Na 'vi say that every
person is born twice.</i>

816
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,923
<i>The second time</i>

817
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:47,426
<i>is when you earn your place
among The People</i>

818
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:48,720
<i>forever.</i>

819
01:20:53,891 --> 01:20:58,188
You are now a son 0F the Omaticaga.

820
01:20:59,396 --> 01:21:02,609
You are Part 0F The People.

821
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:50,030
Come.

822
01:21:50,448 --> 01:21:51,573
Come.

823
01:22:08,341 --> 01:22:11,927
This is a place for
prayers to be heard.

824
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,721
And sometimes answered.

825
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:25,692
We call these trees
Utraya <i>Mokri.</i>

826
01:22:26,234 --> 01:22:27,985
The Tree of Voices.

827
01:22:30,113 --> 01:22:32,364
The voices of our ancestors.

828
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,797
I can hear them.

829
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:54,970
They live, Jake,

830
01:22:57,347 --> 01:22:59,350
within Eywa.

831
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:04,855
You are Omaticaya now.

832
01:23:06,231 --> 01:23:09,527
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

833
01:23:14,073 --> 01:23:16,117
And you may choose a woman.

834
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:20,497
We have many fine women.

835
01:23:21,663 --> 01:23:23,707
Ninat is the best singer.

836
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:28,462
But I don't want Ninat.

837
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:34,719
Peyral is a good hunter.

838
01:23:36,179 --> 01:23:38,347
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

839
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,560
I've already chosen.

840
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:48,858
But this woman
must also choose me.

841
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:53,947
She already has.

842
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:26,479
I am with you now, Jake.

843
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:29,940
<i>We are mated for life.</i>

844
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:38,283
<i>What the hell are you doing, Jake?</i>

845
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:09,939
Ma Jake!

846
01:25:09,939 --> 01:25:11,315
Don't forget your
phase integration.

847
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:12,609
- Jake!
- No, no, the middle button.

848
01:25:12,734 --> 01:25:15,028
- You gotta eat something.
- Yeah, there you go.

849
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:25,037
Jake!Jake.

850
01:25:25,371 --> 01:25:28,041
Wake up! Jake, please!

851
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:30,752
Don't make me
force-feed a cripple.

852
01:25:32,462 --> 01:25:33,755
Grace, I don't want... Hey!

853
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,926
Jake!

854
01:25:47,769 --> 01:25:49,103
Okay.

855
01:25:59,947 --> 01:26:01,948
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

856
01:26:02,074 --> 01:26:04,284
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

857
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:06,371
- I don't need a shower.
- Jesus, Marine.

858
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:11,833
Jake!

859
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:23,930
Jake! Wake up!

860
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:28,685
Hey!

861
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:31,938
Stop! Stop!

862
01:26:31,938 --> 01:26:34,189
- Jake!
- Go back, stop!

863
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:39,695
Hey, boss.

864
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:41,905
Hey!

865
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:44,533
What?

866
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,077
I got a native doing
the funky chicken here.

867
01:26:46,077 --> 01:26:49,079
He's blocking my blade.

868
01:26:49,079 --> 01:26:51,289
Well, keep going.
He'll move.

869
01:26:51,666 --> 01:26:54,961
These people have to learn that we
don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

870
01:26:57,255 --> 01:26:59,506
Stop! Hey!

871
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:02,342
Go! Go!

872
01:27:02,801 --> 01:27:04,761
There, see? He moved.

873
01:27:16,733 --> 01:27:18,525
Dude, dude. Whoa,
dude! Dude, no!

874
01:27:18,525 --> 01:27:20,153
Oh! I'm blind.

875
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:34,708
- Jake!
- Neyfifl!

876
01:27:36,252 --> 01:27:37,962
Here, come on!

877
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:06,157
Freeze it right there.

878
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,493
Scale up. Enhance.

879
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:12,622
Son of a bitch.

880
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:15,707
Unbelievable.

881
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:18,920
- Get me a pilot.
- Yes, sir.

882
01:28:25,717 --> 01:28:27,929
Tsufitcy will lead the war Part9.

883
01:28:34,519 --> 01:28:35,811
Stop Please!

884
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:39,398
This will onlg make it worse.

885
01:28:39,524 --> 01:28:41,442
You do not speak here!

886
01:28:42,359 --> 01:28:44,153
We will strike them in the heart.

887
01:28:52,118 --> 01:28:53,954
Tsu'tey!
Don't do this.

888
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:57,792
<i>'(om</i>

889
01:28:57,792 --> 01:28:59,085
Listen.
Brother...

890
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,091
You mated
with this woman?

891
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:07,426
Oh, shit.

892
01:29:08,594 --> 01:29:11,389
Is this true?

893
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:13,932
We are mated before Eywa.

894
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:15,393
It is done.

895
01:29:16,519 --> 01:29:20,021
Brother, please. Do not
attack the Sky People.

896
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:21,106
Many Omaticaya

897
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:23,568
-will die if you do.
- You are not my brother!

898
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:29,073
And I am not your enemy!

899
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:34,036
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

900
01:29:36,122 --> 01:29:37,747
Go! Go! Go!

901
01:29:40,585 --> 01:29:43,337
- I can talk to them.
- No more talk.

902
01:29:43,337 --> 01:29:44,796
TSUTey!

903
01:29:50,927 --> 01:29:53,096
I am Omaticaya.
I am one of you.

904
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:57,475
And I have the right to speak.

905
01:30:01,605 --> 01:30:03,481
I have something to sag...

906
01:30:05,775 --> 01:30:07,360
...to a" 0F Hou.

907
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:12,742
The words are like
stones in my heart.

908
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:21,583
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

909
01:30:23,127 --> 01:30:24,545
It's very dangerous!

910
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:28,298
Grace!

911
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,010
Oh, no.

912
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,636
- Wait!
- Stay down, sir.

913
01:30:34,512 --> 01:30:37,182
Okay. Look...

914
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:39,435
I was sent here to...

915
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:44,230
You sec?

916
01:30:44,356 --> 01:30:46,900
It is a demon in a False bodg.

917
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:08,213
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

918
01:31:08,213 --> 01:31:10,216
You crossed the line.

919
01:31:13,469 --> 01:31:15,680
Wheel this meat
out of here.

920
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:20,309
Jake! What the hell
is going on here?

921
01:31:23,145 --> 01:31:25,398
You let me down, son.

922
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:28,525
So, what,

923
01:31:29,694 --> 01:31:31,194
you find yourself
some local tail

924
01:31:31,779 --> 01:31:34,990
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

925
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:37,283
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

926
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:39,828
- Parker...
- Shut your pie hole!

927
01:31:40,246 --> 01:31:43,623
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

928
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,418
I could do that.

929
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:47,377
You need to
muzzle your dog.

930
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:50,171
Yeah, can we just take this down
a couple of notches, please?

931
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:51,340
You say you want to
keep your people alive?

932
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,885
You start by
listening to her.

933
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:58,264
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya
in a way you can't imagine.

934
01:31:58,264 --> 01:32:01,475
You know what? You throw
a stick in the air around here,

935
01:32:01,475 --> 01:32:05,145
it's gonna land on some
sacred fern, for Christ's sake!

936
01:32:05,563 --> 01:32:09,024
I'm not talking about some
kind of pagan voodoo here.

937
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:10,484
I'm talking about something real,

938
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:12,819
something measurable in
the biology of the forest.

939
01:32:13,237 --> 01:32:15,573
Which is what, exactly?

940
01:32:15,573 --> 01:32:17,033
What we think
we know

941
01:32:17,158 --> 01:32:20,618
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

942
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:24,873
between the roots of the trees,
like the synapses between neurons.

943
01:32:24,873 --> 01:32:28,752
And each tree has
ten-to-the-fourth connections

944
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:32,840
to the trees around it. And there are
ten-to-the-twelfth trees on Pandora.

945
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:35,926
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

946
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:38,595
It's more connections
than the human brain.

947
01:32:39,721 --> 01:32:42,057
Get it? It's
a network.

948
01:32:42,057 --> 01:32:45,478
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

949
01:32:45,478 --> 01:32:49,023
They can upload and
download data. Memories.

950
01:32:49,023 --> 01:32:52,068
At sites like the one
you just destroyed.

951
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:53,444
Yes!

952
01:32:54,612 --> 01:32:58,239
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

953
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:00,868
They're just goddamn trees!

954
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:06,832
- You need to wake up, Parker.
- No. You need to wake up.

955
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:09,667
The wealth of this world isn't
in the ground. It's all around us.

956
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:13,963
The Na'vi know that, and
they are fighting to defend it.

957
01:33:15,173 --> 01:33:18,344
If you want to share this world with
them, you need to understand them.

958
01:33:18,761 --> 01:33:23,640
I'd say we understand them
just fine, thanks to Jake here.

959
01:33:25,141 --> 01:33:27,560
Hey, Doc,
come take a look.

960
01:33:27,770 --> 01:33:30,021
<i>They're not gonna
give up their home.</i>

961
01:33:31,774 --> 01:33:34,025
<i>They're not gonna make a deal.</i>

962
01:33:34,484 --> 01:33:36,820
<i>For what? Lite beer?</i>

963
01:33:37,404 --> 01:33:38,823
<i>And blue jeans?</i>

964
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:45,787
<i>There's nothing that
we have that they want.</i>

965
01:33:46,956 --> 01:33:50,792
<i>Everything they sent me out here
to do is a waste of time.</i>

966
01:33:54,963 --> 01:33:56,715
<i>They're never gonna
leave Hometree.</i>

967
01:33:58,634 --> 01:34:00,010
So,

968
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:05,349
since a deal can't be made,
I guess things get real simple.

969
01:34:05,349 --> 01:34:08,144
Jake, thanks.

970
01:34:08,726 --> 01:34:11,396
I'm getting all emotional.
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

971
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:23,033
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

972
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:24,702
I'll drive them out with gas first.

973
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,289
It'll be humane.

974
01:34:30,498 --> 01:34:31,792
More or less.

975
01:34:34,002 --> 01:34:36,421
All right, let's
pull the trigger.

976
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:41,385
- Come on, people.
- Oh, man.

977
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:43,011
Let's pack it
up, let's go.

978
01:34:44,054 --> 01:34:45,972
This is how it's done.

979
01:34:48,184 --> 01:34:51,520
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

980
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:53,521
you make them your enemy.

981
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,690
Then you're justified
in taking it.

982
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:58,819
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.

983
01:34:59,235 --> 01:35:00,404
My God.

984
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:09,829
Dr. Augustine! You
cannot be up here!

985
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:11,832
Back off! Parker.

986
01:35:11,957 --> 01:35:14,501
Wait. Stop. These are
people you're about to...

987
01:35:14,627 --> 01:35:15,668
- No. No, no, no, no.
- I said back off!

988
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:20,632
They're fly-bitten savages that live
in a tree! All right? Look around!

989
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:24,345
I don't know about you, but I see
a lot of trees! They can move!

990
01:35:24,886 --> 01:35:26,305
- Can you guys just please...
- Yes, sir.

991
01:35:26,430 --> 01:35:28,890
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

992
01:35:29,015 --> 01:35:30,266
Are you gonna kill children?

993
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:34,354
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands. Believe me.

994
01:35:35,605 --> 01:35:37,565
Just let me try
to talk them out.

995
01:35:37,565 --> 01:35:39,609
They trust me.

996
01:35:42,363 --> 01:35:44,739
Calibrate fast. We're
going in, right now.

997
01:35:44,864 --> 01:35:47,076
Calibrating
three and four.

998
01:35:47,076 --> 01:35:50,078
- Run sequence.
-lnitiating. Thirty seconds.

999
01:35:54,207 --> 01:35:56,085
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

1000
01:35:56,085 --> 01:35:58,671
Unless you want your girlfriend
in there when the ax comes down,

1001
01:35:58,671 --> 01:36:01,340
you get them to evacuate.
One hour.

1002
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,514
Father!

1003
01:36:08,764 --> 01:36:09,806
Mother!

1004
01:36:09,806 --> 01:36:13,143
Egtukan, I have something to 5:59.

1005
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:14,520
Listen!

1006
01:36:15,604 --> 01:36:17,105
Speak, Jakcsully.

1007
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:21,402
Agrcat evil is upon us...

1008
01:36:21,694 --> 01:36:23,654
The 5149 People are coming...

1009
01:36:23,862 --> 01:36:26,448
---i:o destroy f-Iomctrcc-.

1010
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:30,202
Look, tell them they're
gonna be here soon.

1011
01:36:33,413 --> 01:36:35,541
You have to leave,
or you're gonna die.

1012
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:37,917
Are you certain of this?

1013
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:46,092
Look, they sent me here
to learn your ways

1014
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:49,512
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

1015
01:36:52,015 --> 01:36:55,644
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?

1016
01:36:58,855 --> 01:37:00,106
Yes.

1017
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,777
Look, at first it
was just orders,

1018
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:08,657
and then everything changed.
Okay? I fell in love.

1019
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:12,368
I fell in love
with the forest

1020
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:13,996
and with the Omaticaya people.

1021
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:16,372
And with you.

1022
01:37:17,875 --> 01:37:19,126
I trusted you.

1023
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:21,462
- With you. With you.
- I trusted you!

1024
01:37:21,462 --> 01:37:22,253
Trust me now, please.

1025
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:32,347
You will never be one of The People!

1026
01:37:32,765 --> 01:37:34,640
- I shouldn't have...
- We tried to stop them!

1027
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,516
Neytiri, please! Please.

1028
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:42,815
Bind them.

1029
01:37:44,443 --> 01:37:45,610
Leave now!

1030
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:47,237
You have to go.

1031
01:37:47,237 --> 01:37:48,654
They're coming!

1032
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:05,005
<i>Time on target, one mike.</i>

1033
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:07,048
<i>Copy. We have a visual.</i>

1034
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:10,301
<i>Roger that. Stay
on heading 030.</i>

1035
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:11,720
<i>Roger, 030.</i>

1036
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,610
- Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

1037
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,447
They will destroy this place.

1038
01:38:30,447 --> 01:38:32,698
Neytiri, you must go now!

1039
01:38:37,246 --> 01:38:39,122
Run to the forest! Run!

1040
01:38:40,582 --> 01:38:41,667
Run! Run!

1041
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:46,505
Have no Fear.

1042
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:06,649
No! God damn it, run!

1043
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:08,819
Take the ikran...

1044
01:39:08,819 --> 01:39:10,445
mattack From above.

1045
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:16,827
That is one
big damn tree.

1046
01:39:24,292 --> 01:39:26,377
Well, well, well.

1047
01:39:26,377 --> 01:39:28,671
I'd say diplomacy
has failed.

1048
01:39:30,466 --> 01:39:32,634
All right, people,
let's get this done!

1049
01:39:32,634 --> 01:39:36,054
I want every gas round you
got right in the front door.

1050
01:39:36,054 --> 01:39:37,139
Roger. CS .40's going hot.

1051
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:39,224
- Fire.
- Firing.

1052
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:52,945
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

1053
01:40:00,662 --> 01:40:02,247
Sir, they've
opened fire.

1054
01:40:04,123 --> 01:40:05,876
You've got to be kidding me!

1055
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:20,806
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

1056
01:40:20,806 --> 01:40:24,019
All right, let's turn up the
heat. Switch incendiaries!

1057
01:40:24,019 --> 01:40:25,770
Switching incendiaries.

1058
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:27,814
<i>Fire.</i>

1059
01:40:30,192 --> 01:40:31,484
No!

1060
01:40:44,581 --> 01:40:46,375
Get everyone to the Forest.

1061
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:51,880
And that's how you
scatter the roaches.

1062
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:56,592
Neytiri!

1063
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:06,144
We gotta move!

1064
01:41:06,144 --> 01:41:07,938
He's gonna blow the columns!

1065
01:41:08,564 --> 01:41:09,981
My God!

1066
01:41:28,292 --> 01:41:30,167
Mo'at! No!

1067
01:41:30,167 --> 01:41:31,837
If you are one of us,

1068
01:41:33,296 --> 01:41:34,631
help us.

1069
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,390
All call signs,
switch missiles.

1070
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:47,060
<i>Give me HE's at the base
of the west columns.</i>

1071
01:41:48,895 --> 01:41:50,146

1075
01:41:56,194 --> 01:41:57,988
Yeah, baby, get some!

1076
01:41:58,447 --> 01:41:59,905
<i>Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.</i>

1077

Head down!

1081
01:42:17,798 --> 01:42:20,510

1083

Screw this.

1084
01:42:29,144 --> 01:42:31,145
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

1085
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:33,564
I didn't sign up
for this shit!

1086
01:42:42,658 --> 01:42:44,868

No, no, get back! Back!

1089
01:44:24,259 --> 01:44:26,970
Come on! Come on,

1090
01:45:11,806 --> 01:45:15,519
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

1091
01:45:15,976 --> 01:45:17,270
Let's boogie.

1092

Neytiri!

1100
01:46:23,587 --> 01:46:25,337
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1101
01:46:25,462 --> 01:46:28,132
Get away.

1102
01:46:28,132 --> 01:46:29,426
Get away!

1103
01:46:30,551 --> 01:46:33,095
Get away from here!

1104
01:46:33,596 --> 01:46:35,222
Never come back!

1105
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:54,658
Pull the plug.

1106
01:46:54,951 --> 01:46:57,537
- No, you can't do that!
- You can't do that!

1107
01:46:57,662 --> 01:46:59,997
- Calm down! Calm down!
- No! Please!

Put him down!

1112
01:47:40,788 --> 01:47:43,541
You murderer!

1113
01:48:29,878 --> 01:48:31,006
What's going on, brother?

1114
01:48:31,006 --> 01:48:32,340
Long time no see.

1115
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:33,591
Hey.

1116
01:48:34,759 --> 01:48:37,720
Personally, I don't feel these
tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1117
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:40,265
They get steak? That's
bullshit. Let me see that.

1118
01:48:42,016 --> 01:48:44,185
Yeah. You know
what that is. Down.

1119
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:45,561
Trudy!

1120
01:48:45,811 --> 01:48:47,021
All the way down.

1121
01:48:50,358 --> 01:48:51,650
Max!

1122
01:49:01,744 --> 01:49:04,204
Trudy, fire up
the ship! Go!

1123
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:05,998
Here.

1124
01:49:18,136 --> 01:49:19,511
Clear. Come on.

1125
01:49:19,511 --> 01:49:20,637
Here you go.

1126
01:49:36,154 --> 01:49:37,988
Max, stay here.

1127
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:39,783
I need someone
on the inside I can trust.

1128
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:41,367
Okay. Go.

1129
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:56,591
Clear.

1130
01:49:58,342 --> 01:49:59,551
Come on, baby.

1131
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:02,889
Colonel? Sir? I got
a situation here.

1132
01:50:05,934 --> 01:50:09,020
It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.

1133
01:50:12,064 --> 01:50:14,024
Three!

1134

Come on!

1135
01:50:19,363 --> 01:50:20,739
Mask on!

1136
01:50:23,743 --> 01:50:24,911
Gas, gas, gas!

1137
01:50:26,746 --> 01:50:27,663
I'm taking fire!

1138
01:50:27,663 --> 01:50:29,582
<i>Let's gm!</i>

1141
01:50:35,587 --> 01:50:37,172
Come on, let's go!
Let's go, go!

1142
01:50:49,810 --> 01:50:51,186
Colonel!

1143
01:50:58,069 --> 01:50:59,444
Yeah! Yeah!

1144
01:50:59,444 --> 01:51:01,072
All right! Yes!

1145
01:51:04,449 --> 01:51:05,451
Crap.

1146
01:51:05,577 --> 01:51:09,122
- Everybody all right back there?
- Oh, yeah, baby!

1147
01:51:09,122 --> 01:51:11,291
- Norm, you good?
- Yeah!

1148
01:51:11,666 --> 01:51:13,542
This is gonna ruin
my whole day.

1149
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:15,252
Grace is hit!

1150
01:51:15,252 --> 01:51:16,171
What?

1151
01:51:17,255 --> 01:51:18,922
- Get the trauma kit.
- Trauma kit!

1152
01:51:18,922 --> 01:51:20,300
Keep the pressure on, Grace.

1153
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:21,885
Trauma kit's forward,
on the bulkhead.

1154
01:51:22,510 --> 01:51:23,886
Hang on, Grace.

1155
01:51:23,886 --> 01:51:25,387
Doesn't matter.

1156
01:51:25,846 --> 01:51:27,140
It's fine.

1157
01:51:30,350 --> 01:51:31,728
<i>You're good to go.</i>

1158
01:51:31,853 --> 01:51:33,145
Take it up!

1159
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:36,356
<i>Hold on. I'm
pulling pitch.</i>

1160
01:51:40,194 --> 01:51:41,738
You're clear!

1161
01:51:49,703 --> 01:51:52,457
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

1162
01:51:52,457 --> 01:51:53,957
<i>Copy that.</i>

1163
01:52:00,756 --> 01:52:01,882
Norm, you all good up there?

1164
01:52:02,507 --> 01:52:04,176
<i>Yep! Still here.</i>

1165
01:52:06,637 --> 01:52:10,600
Well, at least they can't track us
up here. Not this far into the Vortex.

1166
01:52:10,600 --> 01:52:13,228
It's strongest at the
Tree of Souls, right?

1167
01:52:13,228 --> 01:52:14,354
<i>Yeah.</i>

1168
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:16,396
Good. 'Cause that's
where we're going.

1169
01:52:25,323 --> 01:52:26,532
Ouch.

1170
01:52:29,661 --> 01:52:30,869
You big baby.

1171
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:34,122
We're moving.

1172
01:52:34,666 --> 01:52:36,708
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1173
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:39,503
I'm a scientist, remember?

1174
01:52:40,796 --> 01:52:42,966
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1175
01:52:44,050 --> 01:52:47,720
The People can
help you. I know it.

1176
01:52:49,721 --> 01:52:52,475
Why would they help us?

1177
01:53:07,657 --> 01:53:10,702
<i>The People say
Ewva will provide.</i>

1178
01:53:12,703 --> 01:53:15,832
<i>With no home,
no hope,</i>

1179
01:53:16,457 --> 01:53:18,583
<i>there was only one place they could go.</i>

1180
01:53:33,056 --> 01:53:34,182
Link's
running.

1181
01:53:34,934 --> 01:53:37,895
- What's the plan here, Jake?
- There's no plan.

1182
01:53:39,021 --> 01:53:43,650
Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place.

1183
01:53:44,652 --> 01:53:46,029
gotta try-

1184
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:50,115
Launching.

1185
01:54:11,595 --> 01:54:12,805
<i>Outcast.</i>

1186
01:54:13,597 --> 01:54:14,849
<i>Betrayer.</i>

1187
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:17,060
<i>Alien.</i>

1188
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:20,270
<i>I was in the place
the eye does not see.</i>

1189
01:54:32,574 --> 01:54:36,412
<i>I needed their help,
and they needed mine.</i>

1190
01:54:37,246 --> 01:54:39,207
<i>But to ever face
them again,</i>

1191
01:54:39,332 --> 01:54:41,876
<i>I was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level.</i>

1192
01:54:50,467 --> 01:54:53,762
<i>Sometimes your whole life
boils down to one insane move.</i>

1193
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:58,393
There's something we gotta do.

1194
01:54:58,975 --> 01:55:00,269
You're not gonna like it.

1195
01:55:03,605 --> 01:55:05,358
<i>Yam!</i>

1196
01:55:10,738 --> 01:55:14,408
<i>The way I had it figured, Toruk
is the baddest cat in the sky.</i>

1197
01:55:14,533 --> 01:55:15,451
<i>Nothing attacks him.</i>

1198
01:55:16,786 --> 01:55:18,162
Easy, DOV-

1199
01:55:18,537 --> 01:55:20,539
<i>So Why would he
ever look up?</i>

1200
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:23,417
<i>But that was just a theory.</i>

1201
01:56:33,779 --> 01:56:35,948
<i>Toruk Macto?</i>

1202
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:16,530
I See you.

1203
01:57:19,867 --> 01:57:21,034
I See you.

1204
01:57:29,377 --> 01:57:31,170
I was afraid, Jake.

1205
01:57:32,546 --> 01:57:34,090
For my people.

1206
01:57:37,051 --> 01:57:38,677
I'm not anymore.

My friend is dying.

Grace is dying.

1216
01:58:36,569 --> 01:58:38,613
I beg the help of Eywa.

1217
01:58:50,291 --> 01:58:51,542
Look where we are, Grace.

1218
01:58:58,966 --> 01:59:01,385
I need to take some samples.

1219
01:59:24,824 --> 01:59:28,953
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

1220
01:59:30,747 --> 01:59:32,248
in this body.

1221
01:59:34,126 --> 01:59:35,711
Is that possible?

1222
01:59:35,711 --> 01:59:41,007
She must pass through
the eye of Eywa and return.

1223
01:59:41,509 --> 01:59:42,801
But, Jakesully,

1224
01:59:44,177 --> 01:59:45,470
she is very weak.

1225
01:59:47,264 --> 01:59:48,974
Hang on, Grace.

1226
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:51,226
They're gonna fix you up.

1227
01:59:53,395 --> 01:59:56,023
Hear us Please, A" Mother.

1228
01:59:56,564 --> 01:59:58,900
Egwa, help her.

1229
01:59:59,527 --> 02:00:01,779
Take this spirit into gou...

1230
02:00:05,282 --> 02:00:07,534
Wand breathe her back to us.

1231
02:00:11,372 --> 02:00:13,039
Let her walk among us...

1232
02:00:15,458 --> 02:00:17,545
...as one 0F The People.

1233
02:00:46,532 --> 02:00:47,574
Jake.

1234
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:51,746
Grace.

1235
02:00:53,163 --> 02:00:54,873
I'm with her, Jake.

1236
02:00:56,917 --> 02:00:58,252
She's real!

1237
02:01:01,337 --> 02:01:04,466
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

1238
02:01:05,676 --> 02:01:07,261
What's happening?

1239
02:01:08,261 --> 02:01:09,846
What's happening?

1240
02:01:14,225 --> 02:01:15,895
Grace!

1241
02:01:16,145 --> 02:01:17,270
Grace!

1242
02:01:19,355 --> 02:01:21,859
What's happening?

1243
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:28,657
Did it work?

1244
02:01:34,371 --> 02:01:38,792
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.

1245
02:01:40,085 --> 02:01:41,420
She is with Eywa now.

1246
02:02:15,621 --> 02:02:16,872
With your permission,

1247
02:02:17,206 --> 02:02:18,791
I will speak now.

1248
02:02:20,667 --> 02:02:22,920
You would honor
me by translating.

1249
02:02:30,261 --> 02:02:31,720
The Sky People have
sent us a message

1250
02:02:35,850 --> 02:02:38,226
that they can take
whatever they want

1251
02:02:40,061 --> 02:02:41,814
and no one can stop them.

1252
02:02:45,442 --> 02:02:47,194
Well, we will send
them a message.

1253
02:02:49,822 --> 02:02:52,157
You ride out as fast as
the wind can carry you.

1254
02:02:55,493 --> 02:02:56,953
You tell the other
clans to come.

1255
02:03:01,625 --> 02:03:04,545
You tell them <i>Toruk Macto</i> calls to them.

1256
02:03:05,880 --> 02:03:07,965
And you fly now with me!

1257
02:03:09,507 --> 02:03:10,551
My brothers!

1258
02:03:10,842 --> 02:03:12,261
Sisters!

1259
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:16,265
And we will show
the Sky People

1260
02:03:16,265 --> 02:03:18,100
that they cannot take
whatever they want,

1261
02:03:20,019 --> 02:03:21,353
and that this,

1262
02:03:21,353 --> 02:03:22,604
this is our land!

1263
02:03:46,086 --> 02:03:47,046
<i>Yam!</i>

1264
02:04:17,242 --> 02:04:18,452
<i>Yam!</i>

1265
02:04:36,095 --> 02:04:37,762
<i>We rode out
to the four winds.</i>

1266
02:04:40,349 --> 02:04:41,975
<i>To the horse clans of the plain.</i>

1267
02:04:45,813 --> 02:04:46,729
Back to the stars!

1268
02:04:46,939 --> 02:04:49,190
<i>To the 'man people
of the Eastern Sea.</i>

1269
02:04:49,190 --> 02:04:50,359
For our children's children!

1270
02:04:50,484 --> 02:04:53,069
<i>When Toruk Macks
called them, they came.</i>

1271
02:04:56,864 --> 02:04:58,658
<i>Yam!</i>

1272
02:05:34,528 --> 02:05:37,030
Everyone on this base,
every one of you,

1273
02:05:37,030 --> 02:05:39,240
is fighting for survival.

1274
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:40,701
That's a fact!

1275
02:05:41,368 --> 02:05:44,454
There's an aboriginal horde
out there massing for an attack.

1276
02:05:46,206 --> 02:05:50,043
Now, these orbital
images tell me

1277
02:05:50,502 --> 02:05:53,546
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

1278
02:05:53,671 --> 02:05:56,675
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1279
02:05:56,884 --> 02:05:58,801
And more are pouring in.

1280
02:06:01,345 --> 02:06:04,224
In a week's time, there
could be 20,000 of them.

1281
02:06:05,309 --> 02:06:10,314
At that point, they will overrun our
perimeter. Well, that's not gonna happen!

1282
02:06:11,023 --> 02:06:14,568
Our only security lies
in pre-emptive attack.

1283
02:06:14,777 --> 02:06:17,112
We will fight terror
with terror.

1284
02:06:21,492 --> 02:06:24,328
Now, the hostiles believe

1285
02:06:24,328 --> 02:06:25,703
that this mountain
stronghold of theirs

1286
02:06:25,703 --> 02:06:29,041
is protected by
their... Their deity.

1287
02:06:30,833 --> 02:06:32,836
And when we destroy it,

1288
02:06:32,961 --> 02:06:35,213
we will blast a crater in
their racial memory so deep

1289
02:06:35,338 --> 02:06:38,801
that they won't come within
1,000 klicks of this place ever again.

1290
02:06:38,926 --> 02:06:42,386
And that, too, is a fact.

1291
02:06:42,386 --> 02:06:43,971
Yeah! Yeah.

1292
02:06:54,649 --> 02:06:59,279
<i>Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.</i>

1293
02:06:59,279 --> 02:07:01,030
<i>They've got these huge
pallets of mine explosives.</i>

1294
02:07:01,030 --> 02:07:04,033
<i>It's for some kind of
shock-and-awe campaign.</i>

1295
02:07:04,033 --> 02:07:06,119
Fricking daisy cutters!

1296
02:07:07,287 --> 02:07:08,412
<i>Quaritch has taken over.</i>

1297
02:07:08,412 --> 02:07:10,373
<i>He's rolling, and there's
no stopping him.</i>

1298
02:07:10,373 --> 02:07:12,333
<i>- When?
-0600 tomorrow.</i>

1299
02:07:12,542 --> 02:07:13,836
<i>- Max! Max!
- I gotta gq</i>

1300
02:07:16,255 --> 02:07:17,713
We're screwed!

1301
02:07:19,257 --> 02:07:24,637
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical
plan that didn't involve martyrdom.

1302
02:07:25,221 --> 02:07:28,559
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1303
02:07:31,603 --> 02:07:33,564
I have 15 clans out there.

1304
02:07:34,314 --> 02:07:35,649
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1305
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:39,819
Now, we know these
mountains. We fly them.

1306
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:42,363
You fly them. They don't.

1307
02:07:43,448 --> 02:07:45,324
Their instruments won't work up here.

1308
02:07:45,449 --> 02:07:49,371
Missile tracking won't work.
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1309
02:07:49,496 --> 02:07:53,457
If they bring the fight to us, then
we have the home-field advantage.

1310
02:07:55,711 --> 02:07:58,796
You know he's gonna commit that
bomber straight to the Tree of Souls.

1311
02:07:59,256 --> 02:08:00,673
Yeah, I know.

1312
02:08:00,673 --> 02:08:02,967
If they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.

1313
02:08:03,135 --> 02:08:08,140
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors. It'll destroy them.

1314
02:08:09,182 --> 02:08:11,768
Then I guess
we'd better stop him.

1315
02:08:26,699 --> 02:08:29,661
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1316
02:08:32,122 --> 02:08:33,748
But if you're there,

1317
02:08:35,333 --> 02:08:38,170
I need to give you a heads-up.

1318
02:08:39,421 --> 02:08:41,131
If Grace is with you,

1319
02:08:42,423 --> 02:08:44,301
look into her memories.

1320
02:08:45,092 --> 02:08:47,011
See the world we come from.

1321
02:08:48,305 --> 02:08:50,140
There's no green there.

1322
02:08:51,600 --> 02:08:53,351
They killed their Mother.

1323
02:08:54,519 --> 02:08:56,979
And they're gonna do the same here.

1324
02:08:58,523 --> 02:09:00,900
More Sky People are gonna come.

1325
02:09:01,193 --> 02:09:04,738
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

1326
02:09:05,529 --> 02:09:07,240
Unless we stop them.

1327
02:09:09,868 --> 02:09:13,622
Look, you chose me
for something.

1328
02:09:14,372 --> 02:09:16,250
I will stand and fight.

1329
02:09:17,333 --> 02:09:19,543
You know I will.

1330
02:09:21,421 --> 02:09:23,966
But I need a little help here.

1331
02:09:29,805 --> 02:09:32,807
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

1332
02:09:35,226 --> 02:09:38,229
She protects only
the balance of life.

1333
02:09:49,908 --> 02:09:51,827
It was worth a try.

1334
02:10:22,274 --> 02:10:24,359
Yeah! Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about!

1335
02:10:24,359 --> 02:10:28,070
Yeah! Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about, man!

1336
02:10:39,791 --> 02:10:43,252
<i>This is Group Leader. We
are entering the Flux Vortex.</i>

1337
02:10:43,587 --> 02:10:46,131
<i>- Switch to manual flight mode.
- Copy. Manual flight mode.</i>

1338
02:11:22,083 --> 02:11:23,835
This is Papa Dragon.

1339
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:27,171
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

1340
02:11:34,845 --> 02:11:35,764
Suit Team, go.

1341
02:11:36,180 --> 02:11:38,350
<i>All right, ladies,
let's bring the pain!</i>

1342
02:11:49,194 --> 02:11:50,820
Move, move, move!

1343
02:11:56,201 --> 02:11:57,993
<i>Bravo 1-1 ,
move left.</i>

1344
02:11:58,537 --> 02:12:01,914
<i>Bravo 1-1 moving
left. Watch flank.</i>

1345
02:12:04,292 --> 02:12:07,753
<i>- Watch formation. Keep moving.
- Roger that.</i>

1346
02:12:07,962 --> 02:12:10,215
<i>Charlie 2-1,
watch your spacing.</i>

1347
02:12:10,215 --> 02:12:11,716
<i>Copy that. Over.</i>

1348
02:12:11,716 --> 02:12:14,051
Eyes up. Check
that overhead.

1349
02:12:14,761 --> 02:12:17,012
And watch those
thermal scans.

1350
02:12:17,012 --> 02:12:20,266
<i>All call signs, Papa has
lead, pushing to target.</i>

1351
02:12:21,435 --> 02:12:23,395
<i>Escorts, stay close
on my shuttle.</i>

1352
02:12:28,024 --> 02:12:30,609
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1353
02:12:31,528 --> 02:12:35,448
<i>Gun crews, keep your head on a
swivel. Make no mistake, people,</i>

1354
02:12:36,365 --> 02:12:38,702
<i>they're out there.</i>

1355
02:12:38,702 --> 02:12:41,997
All right, people, target
in sight. Range, four klicks.

1356
02:12:41,997 --> 02:12:44,373
Valkyrie 1-6, get
your payload ready.

1357
02:12:44,373 --> 02:12:45,625
Copy. Prepare
to offload.

1358
02:12:45,750 --> 02:12:46,667
Staff Sergeant,
stage the weapon.

1359
02:12:47,752 --> 02:12:49,753
Roll it to the ramp!
Let's go!

1360
02:12:52,047 --> 02:12:53,382
Hold!

1361
02:13:00,806 --> 02:13:02,391
<i>Charlie 2-1, got
big movement.</i>

1362
02:13:03,435 --> 02:13:05,395
<i>- Hold position.
- Hold up, hold up.</i>

1363
02:13:05,395 --> 02:13:09,524
<i>- We got movement out there, 500 meters.
- Charlie 2-1, hold position.</i>

1364
02:13:15,197 --> 02:13:16,530
Sir, ground has movement!

1365
02:13:17,032 --> 02:13:17,990
Fast approaching.

1366
02:13:18,115 --> 02:13:19,826
<i>Charlie Oscar, Rider section.</i>

1367
02:13:19,826 --> 02:13:20,868
Firing line!

1368
02:13:21,077 --> 02:13:23,121
<i>Targets closing.</i>

1369
02:13:23,121 --> 02:13:24,413
<i>Range, 400 meters.</i>

1370
02:13:24,413 --> 02:13:25,748
Can't you clean it up?

1371
02:13:25,748 --> 02:13:27,417
No, sir. It's the Flux.

1372
02:13:55,612 --> 02:13:57,905
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.

1373
02:14:40,030 --> 02:14:42,742
All aircraft, weapons
free! Weapons free!

1374
02:14:43,868 --> 02:14:45,161
Break right.
Come around.

1375
02:14:48,664 --> 02:14:50,583
Light them up!

1376
02:14:57,716 --> 02:15:00,092
Break formation,
engage all hostiles.

1377
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:08,810
Yeah! Get some!

1378
02:15:48,140 --> 02:15:50,018
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1379
02:16:00,779 --> 02:16:02,572
Jake!Jake!
You copy?

1380
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:05,908
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1381
02:16:05,908 --> 02:16:07,118
Copy. Get out of there.

1382
02:16:12,082 --> 02:16:13,625
That's him. Get after him!

1383
02:16:30,475 --> 02:16:31,434
Take him out!

1384
02:16:40,025 --> 02:16:41,152
Light her up!

1385
02:16:50,995 --> 02:16:52,371
Right there!

1386
02:16:52,371 --> 02:16:54,665
You're not the only one
with a gun, bitch.

1387
02:16:54,665 --> 02:16:56,584
- Keep her in your sights.
- Purging. Feeding the leak.

1388
02:16:56,584 --> 02:16:57,668
Arming all pods.

1389
02:17:03,216 --> 02:17:04,467
That's it!

1390
02:17:34,789 --> 02:17:35,957
Seze!

1391
02:18:40,146 --> 02:18:42,565
<i>Rogue One is hit.
I'm going in.</i>

1392
02:18:43,191 --> 02:18:44,566
Sorry, Jake.

1393
02:18:53,243 --> 02:18:54,576
Fire.

1394
02:19:12,637 --> 02:19:14,180
TSUTey!

1395
02:19:14,305 --> 02:19:15,932
Brother, do you read?

1396
02:19:17,891 --> 02:19:19,602
Rogue One,
you copy?

1397
02:19:21,563 --> 02:19:22,772
Trudy!

1398
02:19:33,657 --> 02:19:35,075
Time to target, two minutes.

1399
02:19:35,325 --> 02:19:37,912
Valkyrie 1-6, you are
cleared and hot.

1400
02:19:37,912 --> 02:19:40,122
Copy, Dragon. We are
starting our bomb run.

1401
02:19:45,836 --> 02:19:47,462
Arm number one!

1402
02:19:48,505 --> 02:19:50,632
Number one armed!

1403
02:19:51,049 --> 02:19:52,093
Ma Jake!

1404
02:19:54,177 --> 02:19:55,513
I read you.

1405
02:20:04,522 --> 02:20:05,565
<i>Neytiri!</i>

1406
02:20:05,690 --> 02:20:07,191
Seze's dead.

1407
02:20:07,191 --> 02:20:10,611
They are very close. They are many.

1408
02:20:11,029 --> 02:20:12,947
Do not attack.

1409
02:20:13,156 --> 02:20:15,074
<i>Do you read me, Neytiri?</i>

1410
02:20:17,659 --> 02:20:19,037
Do not attack!

1411
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:21,371
<i>Fall back now.
Get out of there!</i>

1412
02:20:21,371 --> 02:20:22,790
<i>That's an order!</i>

1413
02:20:30,048 --> 02:20:31,174
<i>Neytiri!</i>

1414
02:20:33,885 --> 02:20:35,802
<i>I got movement,
I got movement.</i>

1415
02:20:35,802 --> 02:20:37,013
Hold position.

1416
02:20:37,013 --> 02:20:38,138
Something's coming.

1417
02:20:38,138 --> 02:20:39,974
<i>Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.
Turn screens over.</i>

1418
02:20:39,974 --> 02:20:42,101
<i>- We got movement 200 meters.
- Hold your formation.</i>

1419
02:20:42,226 --> 02:20:44,102
<i>- Be ready.
- Watch your flanks.</i>

1420
02:20:49,149 --> 02:20:50,817
<i>Hundred meters and closing fast.</i>

1421
02:21:07,251 --> 02:21:09,211
We gotta get out of here!

1422
02:21:10,712 --> 02:21:11,673
Fall back! Fall back!

1423
02:21:11,673 --> 02:21:12,799
<i>Move! Move! Move!</i>

1424
02:21:12,799 --> 02:21:14,467
<i>Fall back! On the run!
On the run!</i>

1425
02:21:22,100 --> 02:21:24,727
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1426
02:21:31,609 --> 02:21:34,278
Eywa has heard you!

1427
02:21:43,704 --> 02:21:44,871
Come on!

1428
02:21:57,635 --> 02:21:59,469
Fall back! Move! Move!

1429
02:22:24,037 --> 02:22:26,747
Sir! All escorts are
down or falling back.

1430
02:22:26,747 --> 02:22:28,875
Let's get this done.

1431
02:22:28,875 --> 02:22:30,126
Valkyrie 1-6,

1432
02:22:30,126 --> 02:22:32,253
<i>this is Dragon.
Press to target.</i>

1433
02:22:32,670 --> 02:22:34,297
Copy. Pressing
to target.

1434
02:22:34,297 --> 02:22:36,006
Stand by to drop,
30 seconds.

1435
02:22:56,443 --> 02:22:58,279
On my mark.
Two, one, mark.

1436
02:22:58,279 --> 02:22:59,280
Drop! Drop! Drop!

1437
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:00,656
Go, go, g0, go!

1438
02:23:34,731 --> 02:23:35,941
Brace!

1439
02:23:52,250 --> 02:23:53,376
It's Sully.

1440
02:24:08,014 --> 02:24:10,893
- Mask on!
- Breach alarm!

1441
02:26:47,424 --> 02:26:49,260
Come on.
Come to papa.

1442
02:27:16,953 --> 02:27:17,788
Give it up, Quaritch!

1443
02:27:21,625 --> 02:27:22,834
It's all over.

1444
02:27:24,378 --> 02:27:26,588
<i>Nothing's over
while I'm breathing.</i>

1445
02:27:26,922 --> 02:27:29,342
I kind of hoped
you'd say that.

1446
02:28:24,939 --> 02:28:26,106
Come on!

1447
02:28:42,456 --> 02:28:43,623
Hey, Sully,

1448
02:28:44,375 --> 02:28:46,502
how's it feel to
betray your own race?

1449
02:28:51,215 --> 02:28:53,342
You think you're one of them?

1450
02:28:54,635 --> 02:28:56,512
Time to wake up.

1451
02:30:40,406 --> 02:30:41,617
Jake?

1452
02:30:55,255 --> 02:30:56,674
Jake.

1453
02:31:14,358 --> 02:31:16,360
Jake.

1454
02:31:31,500 --> 02:31:32,709
Jake!

1455
02:31:32,834 --> 02:31:34,586
Ma Jake!

1456
02:32:15,418 --> 02:32:16,711
I See you.

1457
02:32:22,425 --> 02:32:23,718
I See you.

1458
02:32:35,355 --> 02:32:38,149
<i>The aliens went back
to their dying world.</i>

1459
02:32:40,361 --> 02:32:41,904
<i>Only a few</i>

1460
02:32:42,111 --> 02:32:43,530
<i>were chosen to stay.</i>

1461
02:32:55,459 --> 02:32:57,920
<i>The time of great
sorrow was ending.</i>

1462
02:33:00,047 --> 02:33:02,424
<i>Toruk Masts was
nolongerneeded.</i>

1463
02:33:14,977 --> 02:33:18,856
<i>Well, I guess this is
my last video log.</i>

1464
02:33:20,734 --> 02:33:22,778
<i>'Cause whatever
happens tonight,</i>

1465
02:33:23,654 --> 02:33:25,030
<i>either way, I'm...</i>

1466
02:33:25,572 --> 02:33:28,367
<i>I'm not gonna be coming
back to this place.</i>

1467
02:33:31,995 --> 02:33:34,122
Well, I guess
I'd better go.

1468
02:33:36,709 --> 02:33:39,836
Yeah, I don't want to be
late for my own party.

1469
02:33:43,131 --> 02:33:46,468
Yeah, it's my
birthday, after all.

1470
02:33:48,094 --> 02:33:50,431
<i>This is Jake Sully signing off.</i>

1471
02:41:36,729 --> 02:41:37,814
