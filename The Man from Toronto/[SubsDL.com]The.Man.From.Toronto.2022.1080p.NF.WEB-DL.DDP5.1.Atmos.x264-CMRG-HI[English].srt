You can stretch it,
do whatever you want with it.

The best thing is
to get you some reps in there though.

"Teddy, what is it?"

34

I'll tell you exactly what it is.
It's an adjustable pull-up bar.

35
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,051
Why did I make it?

36
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,303
Because some pull-up bars
are just too high.

37

So this one adjusts to your comfort level.

to the right height and pull up all night.

Before we begin I'd like
to tell you a little about myself.

70
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,779
I was raised by my grandfather

71
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,867
on a frozen lake 50 miles from nowhere.

72
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,203
He was a kind man.

73
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,207
He taught me many useful things.

74
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:56,629
One brisk afternoon,
while we were fishing on the frozen lake,

75
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,757
we saw a large form approaching.

76
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,843
It was a grizzly.

77
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,762
My grandfather yelled at me to run,

78
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:08,683
so I took off as fast
as my little legs would carry me.

79
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,685
And when I looked back,

80
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,062
I learned the last thing

81
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,482
that my unfortunate grandfather
would ever teach me.

82
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:20,153
Bears have very sharp claws,

83
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:26,701
which they use to fillet the skin
off their still-breathing victims.

84

I share this with you
because when you beg for your life,

00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,340
Oh, you gonna take me on the tour.

321
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,261
What is it, a game room?
You got a ping-pong table down here?

322
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,637
[laughs]

323
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,682
Probably… Hey, how are you doing?
You with the rental team?

324
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,891
Good to see you.

325
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,643
Oh, my. Hold on. What the…

326
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,145
- No.
- Uh-uh.

327
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,354
Excuse me.

328
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,733
We have work to do.
You're not leaving until it's done.

329
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,401
We…

330
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:09,445
We got work to do? Oh. Uh…

331
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,070
Mr. Coughlin,

332
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,115
allow me to introduce

333
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,743
the Man from Toronto.

334
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,288
What? Hold on. Wait a second.

335
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,332
The Man from Toronto?
Just give me… Give a second. Give me…

336
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,416
Hmm.

337
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:24,918
Wait, hold on.

338
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,296
Just hold on a second.

339
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:32,468
I know a guy that knows a guy
that saw you do this once.

340
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,803
Said it was life-changing.

341
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,473
And now I get to witness it firsthand.

342
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,474
Mm.

343
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,225
Unless, of course, he talks.

344
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,855
"Unless, of course, he talks."

345
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,814
[grunts]

346
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,484
He said, if he talks,

347
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,195
then things can be different.

348
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,363
Because you, you know who I am.

349
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,823
You know me.

350
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,243
You guys all…
Everybody here must know who I am.

351
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,624
Now, if you know what I know,
that's that I love to communicate.

352
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,626
So let's figure out the best way to talk.

353
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,835
Right?

354
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,296
- Please.
- I hope you understand what I'm saying.

355
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:13,217
Last I checked,
communication is key to understanding.

356
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,426
[grunts]

357
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,678
Is it muggy? Are you guys… Is it a little…

358
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,514
The air, right? Back up. Back up.

359
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,642
Put the hammer down and back up.
You're crowding me, okay?

360
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:25,646
And I can't do whatever it is
I'm here to do with you on my ass.

361
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,523
Now, what you need to know

362
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,149
is that…

363
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,111
[whispers] I don't know what is going on.

364
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,654
I don't know what they want.

365
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,740
They called me the Man from Toronto.
I don't even know who that is.

366
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,451
- Give them what they want. Is it money?
- [whimpers] No.

367
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,286
He starts with the eyes.

368
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:42,704
[groans]

369
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,456
You said what? I start…

370
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,834
You start with the eyes.

371
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,918
Hmm.

372
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,878
- [whimpers]
- [Teddy] You're gonna listen.

373
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,796
I love eyes.

374
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,174
I would hate for your eyes
to be next on my activity list.

375
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,717
[mouthing] I don't wanna do this.

376
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,761
[whispering] I don't like none of this.

377
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,639
- I don't like nasty stuff.
- [sobs]

378
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,015
I don't like blood.

379
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,686
They say he filleted
an entire poker parlor in Minnesota.

380
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,147
I… I did what in Minnesota?

381
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,275
Filleted the entire poker parlor.

382
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,194
Goddamn right I did.
Don't nobody else say anything.

383
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,613
You know why?
Because at this point I'm getting angry.

384
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,782
I'm getting angry,
and I'm about to get real active.

385
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,827
Look at my thumbs. Because
it's the last thing you're gonna see.

386
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,163
Look at this. Look at me, I'm gonna do it.

387
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,957
- Oh, God, no.
- What? Do you want me to do it?

388
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,875
No!

389
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,209
- Do you want me...
- No!

390
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,210
- I'm gonna do it!
- No.

391
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,171
- [Teddy] Do you think I'm playing?
- [moans]

392
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,715
- I can't hear you! Is that what you want?
- Ah! No.

393
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,633
- Is that what you want? Then say it!
- No.

394
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,218
- Say it!
- Okay, I'll tell you!

395
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,302
Say it!

396
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,681
Okay, 4-4-5-0-8

[sobbing] I'm sorry, please don't.
Please don't hurt me.

00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,648
- Let me get myself together.
- Please…

401
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,734
Let me get myself together.

402
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,194
[man] Please. Don't hurt…

403
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,070
- [moans]
- Is that… Is that what you needed?

404
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,615
- Hey. It's me.
- [whispers] You saved our lives.

405
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,326
Yeah. Tell the colonel we got the codes.

406
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,535
And the Man from Toronto

407
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,996
is gonna continue on
to Washington, DC to meet.

430
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,794
We got him.

431
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,964
What'd I do?

432
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,049
[police radio chatter]

433
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:03,011
It was a low toner situation.
Me and my wife, we were going to a cabin.

434
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,889
But because of the low toner,
I couldn't make out the address.

435
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,350
I didn't know if it was a six or an eight.

436
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:12,104
Look, I'm not the Man from Toronto, okay?

437
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,064
I'm actually just an idiot from Yorktown.

438
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:17,693
- We're well aware, Mr. Jackson.
- So please guys, let me go.

439
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,277
Show him.

440
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,240
- This phone…
- [Teddy] Mm. That don't look good.

…was recovered on the scene
from the man who led you into the cabin.

442
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,831
Just before the attack, a text was sent
to the former Venezuelan colonel

443
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,124
Sebastián Marín.

444
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,044
Last year Marín staged a coup
to overthrow his own government.

445
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,754
He was stopped by US Intelligence,

446
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,632
but he and his wife escaped
before they were apprehended.

447
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,010
He swore revenge on us ever since.

448
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,512
- Marín has been planning an attack.
- We can't find him.

449
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,140
The Man from Toronto was our only way in.

450
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,268
And now Marín believes that
you are the Man from Toronto.

451
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,853
Our only way to find him

452
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:55,897
is if you continue
to be the Man from Toronto.

We all know what happened on the deck.

632
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,987
That's where I hit my head.

633
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,489
You heard what I said.

634
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,534
[Davis] What the hell is he doing?

635
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,119
I'm him. I'm Toronto.

636
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,538
What?

637
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,206
Daniela Marín.

638
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,834
Uh-uh.

639
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,172
My colleagues Luís and Andrés.

640
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,133
It is an honor for all of us.

641
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,349
I'm eager to meet the Colonel.

642
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,726
Once the next phase is done.

643
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,103
No, it's one phase, right?

644
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,939
I give you the numbers.
After that, I get the money.

645
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,232
It's a oner.

646
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,401
No, no. Always two.

647
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,944
No. That's not the deal.

648
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,027
The deal…

649
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:07,574
The deal was to meet the Colonel here.

650
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:08,657
They're on the move.

- Should I intercept?

Well, I am going now.
The Man from Toronto has left the scene.

Who would've thought it?

has ever sat bitch.

Davis, do you have a visual on Jackson?

670
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,917
[Toronto] "Negative."

671
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,335
- Negative.
- [Lawrence] <i>Negative?</i>

672
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,878
You were right behind him.

"He ditched the tracker."

[unmutes beep]

I think he ditched it.
Scared they were gonna find it on him.

What?

677

You have a visual.
Yellow truck headed south.

678
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,766
He's in the yellow truck headed south.
Assistance required.

You said, "Phase two." What is phase two?

683
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:29,739
The man you met in the cabin,
Mr. Coughlin, had a partner, Mr. Green.

684
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,033
Mr. Coughlin had half
of what the colonel needed.

685
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,035
Mr. Green has the other half.

686
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,995
You will bring him to the Colonel.

687

[Teddy] I'm sorry, but where are we going?

696
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,101
You're going to Puerto Rico.

697
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,147
Okay. All right.

How did we just lose him?

I thought that we were going commercial.

I don't know why
I thought I heard you say Delta.

Somebody popped the trunk on this one.

Y'all don't do a lot of talking, huh?

00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,008
My type of people.

712

I don't like to talk either.

Especially in the air.
What is there to talk about?

Nothing.

No.

And it's not about you guys.
We're on the same team.

It's about whoever this is.

This man is an imposter.

Objection. I mean, no. Stop.

I'm surprised at you gentlemen.

That you could actually believe
that this whiny little mosquito

is actually the Man from Toronto.

Gentlemen.

Trust me. <i>I'm </i>the Man from Toronto.

And I don't know where you're from either,

735
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:15,905
but I know that I come from a frozen lake
50 miles from nowhere.

736
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,282
Are you stealing my origin story?

737
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,827
Here's a little secret of mine.

738
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,955
I love 19th-century American poetry.

739
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,456
It's my hobby.

740
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,250
Let's hear some Keats.

You wanna hear

You got some sack on you
to come up here without gender etiquette.

He may not identify as a "he" anymore.

It's all about being gender-neutral.

Obviously, you didn't get the message.

You don't know who you're offending.

Now you okay?
Is anybody offended? Are you offended?

If so, this is the time to speak up.

You ain't the boss of me.

What you need to do is put your weapon up.

There is some sense in that.

757

we don't need to discharge a firearm

where I was in a situation

where somebody grabbed my backpack.

00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,821
And I turned around,
without knowing who it was,

882

And that's when the principal came.

What are we talking about right now?

00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,707
My marriage… Matter of fact, no, my life…

Okay. Honey, listen,
I know you made a reservation for us,

What does that mean
outside of being untrue?

Dogs don't eat other dogs.

So it can't be a dog-eat-dog world.

Naturally, a dog will sniff
another dog's butt.

One, two, three, four. There were six!

Two of them fell out the back,

You're responsible for that.

I'm scared.

1112
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:41,973
- I can't do it. I don't think I can do it.
- You can do this. And you will.

1116

I got an address, but I don't have
all the information I need.

1117
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,992
One time, one time only. Who is Green?

1118
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:07,124
Do you guys have any idea
who you're dealing with?

1119
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,209
The Man from Toronto!

1120
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:10,709
[Teddy] Shit.

1121
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:13,004
- Let me do my thing.
- Sorry.

1122

<i>Show 'em what you brought.</i>

1124

I got ways of getting my answers.

00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:24,099
And I'll get them.

1126

You dropped the knives?

1129

You want some help with that?

[Toronto] <i>Questions.</i>
<i>You're asking the questions.</i>

Are you familiar with reverse psychology?

1132
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,572
- No.
- That's right. The answer's no.

1133
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,116
If you did know
the tactic that I just employed,

1134
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,119
dropping my utensils on the floor,
making me seem incompetent,

1135
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,997
it was all just a ploy
to get into their heads.

1136
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:48,915
Mind games.

1137
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,001
And I got a lot of them.

1138
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,087
Mixing stuff up is what I love to do.

1139
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,299
Question is,
who am I gonna do it to first?

1140
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,968
[Toronto] <i>Eyes. Look him in the eyes.</i>

[whispering] Come on. I can't do this.

1142
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:13,356
We can't afford for you to Teddy this one.

1143
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,484
Get up from under that table.
Wave the knives around.

1144
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,861
Don't be a wuss.

1145

Oh…

1151

- You know what this is?
- Some kind of disemboweler.

1152
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,678
Some kind of disemboweler.

1153

'Cause I don't like bowels.

I… I don't know.

- I knew this wasn't gonna work.
- What do you want me to do with this?

1159
00:53:56,816 --> 00:54:00,779
- Hmm? I'll do this all over your face.
- Please, please, I'm not Green.

1160
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,256
- You're not Green?
- I'm not Green.

He say he not Green.

That's what he says.

- You can see.
- I can't see!

You're looking at me,

- Obviously.

Research Projects Agency.

That's not what I had. I had a ringworm.

1221
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,143
Coughlin and I worked there
in the early 2000s

[Teddy] Mm.

1225
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,571
Two years ago, our former boss
called General Hanson,

1226
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,659
he asked for help
with a top-secret project

<i>for an unnamed client.</i>

<i>I didn't get many of the details.</i>

1229
00:56:56,663 --> 00:57:00,291
We didn't know
Hanson had been hired by Marín.

1230
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:02,376
What for?

1231

When we realized what he was planning,
we built in two fail-safes.

1233

The remote detonator to the explosive,

1234
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:17,809
it needs both Coughlin's coded sequence

and my thumbprint.

1236

Of course we're not.

You don't need me anymore.

Actually, I do need you

You're gonna have to kill me

It's not me you need to worry about.

And I choose not to be you anymore.

No.

Not being able to follow through.

Not having the guts.

You know? You literally fight air.

The only thing you ever landed

01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,724
Yeah. I'm fine, I promise.

1423
01:05:36,807 --> 01:05:37,808
<i>Okay, then.</i>

1424
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:38,976
See you tonight.

1425
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,371
- [Annie] Get off the phone!
- Oh, and I just wanna make sure

1426
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,314
you got my message
about the new reservation.

1427
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:46,692
- 7:00 p.m., L'Ambassadeur.
- L'Ambassadeur, bitch!

1428
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:50,321
- <i>It's meant to be the most amazing place.</i>
- Yeah. I'll, um...

1429
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:51,405
[hangs up]

1430
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,366
What are you doing?
I didn't even say goodbye.

1431
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,159
- Hello? Hello?
- Let's get pre-lit!

1432
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:57,387
[woman on TV]
<i>This is an historic moment for Venezuela…</i>

1433
01:05:57,411 --> 01:06:00,623
Well, you can say hello
tonight at the L'Ambassadeur.

1434
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,636
Wait, the drop is supposed
to be at 9:00 p.m. You're gonna let me go?

1435
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:08,381
Oh, uh, yeah.
Not only am I gonna let you go,

1436
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,883
I'm gonna let her know
you're bringing an associate.

[woman on TV] <i>…of ups and downs.</i>

1440
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:23,854
By the way,
I've been waiting to check this place out.

1441
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:26,148
It's got durian sorbet on the menu.

1442
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:27,733
[Teddy] What the hell is durian?

1443
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:32,947
Yorktown is entering the restaurant
with an unidentified male. Do you copy?

1444
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,865
- Can we get an ID?
- Negative.

1445
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,909
This could be the Marín meeting.

1446
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:40,204
L'Ambassadeur security feed
coming up now, ma'am.

1447
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,874
Hey, you wanna hold on to the thumb
or you wanna check it?

1448
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,629
Okay, come here.
Let me talk to you. Please. Please.

1449
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:53,592
I want you to relax. Okay?

1450
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:56,971
Listen, you should...
Get your hands off of me like that.

1451
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:02,143
It's 'cause of the cameras.
Stop with the paranoia stuff.

1452
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:05,604
Somebody looks you in your eyes
and they smile, smile back.

1453
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,232
Make eye contact. Be a person.

1454
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,860
Perhaps you'd be
more comfortable in this, sir.

1455
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:15,031
That's not the type
of eye contact I'm talking about.

1456
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,952
- Thank you.
- [maître d'] My pleasure.

1457
01:07:20,036 --> 01:07:21,287
Oh, no problem.

1458
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:25,041
I'm just asking that you
make the most out of this, okay?

1459
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,126
How do I look?

1460
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:29,753
Who's she with?

1461
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,339
Her friend Anne. Why?

1462
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:35,092
You didn't tell me about Anne.

1463
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:37,762
I didn't know that
I had to tell you about Anne.

1464
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,014
- [sighs]
- What's the problem?

1465
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,724
I get uncomfortable…

1466
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:43,976
Around women.

1467
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:46,562
So, how do you deal with Debora?

1468
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:51,108
- Debora is different. Debora...
- Stop it. Why are you complicating this?

1469
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,943
- Same as you talking to Debora.
- Okay.

1470
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:55,821
- [Teddy] Hey.
- Hey! There you go.

1471
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:57,364
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.

1472
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:58,699
- Hey.
- Hi.

1473
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:01,786
Oh my God.
I thought I was never gonna see you again.

1474
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:03,411
Well, here I am.

1475
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,165
Who is this?

1476
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,584
This is the Man from…

1477
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:10,586
Equinox.

1478
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,254
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1479
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,174
- All right, let's sit down.
- Okay, great. Thank you.

1480
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:16,818
- Let's all sit down.
- [Anne] Hi, Teddy.

1481
01:08:16,842 --> 01:08:17,676
Hey, Anne!

1482
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,470
Who is this guy, Santoro?

1483
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:21,393
- Does he look like Colonel Marín?
<i>- No, ma'am.</i>

1484
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:24,141
<i>It must be the Man from Toronto.
This is our chance.</i>

1485
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,769
- Can we get a higher resolution?
- [tech] That's a negative.

1486
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,687
Get me another camera.

1487
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,689
When Teddy texted,

1488
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:33,150
I didn't want
the whole third-wheel dynamic,

1489
01:08:33,234 --> 01:08:34,360
so I brought you a date.

1490
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,487
Don't worry. It doesn't have to be a date.

1491
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,280
Anne's my best friend from college.

1492
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:41,325
It actually could be,
Mr. Tall, Dark and Scary.

1493
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:43,702
[Teddy] No. No.

1494
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:44,912
It can't.

1495
01:08:44,995 --> 01:08:48,874
All right, stop, don't even panic.
That's his way of telling you he's taken.

1496
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,918
- He's got a lady. Her name's Debora.
- All right.

1497
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,462
Well, actually, Debora is a…
[clears throat]

1498
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:57,091
1969 Dodge Charger 440 R/T.

1499
01:08:57,174 --> 01:08:58,801
Come again? What'd you say?

1500
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:00,344
Debora's a car?

1501
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:03,514
The 440 R/T is not just a car.

1502
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:08,894
With eight cylinders of big block,
high torque horsepower,

1503
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:10,478
it's a weapon.

1504
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:14,567
- I'm happy celebrating my wife's birthday.
- [Lori] Yes, my love.

1505
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,153
- Correctly.
- That's right. You look good.

1506
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,113
- And it's a man-size too.
- I love it.

1507
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:20,656
[Teddy] I got it in, uh…

1508
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,325
[Anne] It's some nice ink over there.

1509
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:25,452
Are you a chef or…

1510
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,580
Oh, well, yeah, I…

1511
01:09:27,663 --> 01:09:29,331
I wanted to be. Yeah.

1512
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,666
It's not too late.

1513
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,919
Well, you know,
I actually thought about that.

1514
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:38,132
I thought about opening my own place.
A great, great restaurant.

1515
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:43,012
But then I just remember everything,

1516
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:45,222
and it just doesn't seem…

1517
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,682
[clears throat]

1518
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:48,017
…realistic, you know?

1519
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,100
Really?

1520
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:50,435
Why not?

1521
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:51,896
Well, it's just,

1522
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:53,898
kinda scary.

1523
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:54,981
I mean, what if…

1524
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:56,734
Nobody came?

1525
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,570
I'd come.

1526
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:02,989
Really?

1527
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,034
Mm-hmm.

1528
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:07,203
It's gotta be him.
Do you want me to intercept?

1529
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,370
Wait for backup.

- Oh, come on, baby. Please?

We're gonna unlearn
whatever he taught you.

- I feel a bit self-conscious.

Loosen up a little bit.

Hey, we gotta go.

[Toronto] What is going on?

That guy… That guy is here, man.

- Who, the waiter?
- No, not the waiter.

1590
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:48,447
The guy from Puerto Rico
that tried to kill us. He's here.

- Do you think Anne likes me?
- What?

- I was dancing.

- Hey!
- I mean…

1594

Snap out of it, man!

1595
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,082
He's trying to kill us!

1596
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:00,376
I need you to go back
to being the killer you are

1597
01:13:00,459 --> 01:13:02,294
and to understand that we are in trouble!

1598
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,254
Are you not listening to what I'm saying?

1599

He's here!

- Me.

The Man from Miami.

1602
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,264
Give me the thumb.

1603
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:18,976
Now.

1604
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:27,277
Hand it to me. Just walk it over.

1605
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:29,947
Thumb. What are you…

1606
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:31,990
Why are you doing that? Stop.

1607
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,245
I still can't believe you stored
a human thumb in a Cheese Puffs bag.

1608
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,289
The Cheese Puffs bag
is what's throwing you off?

1609
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:40,374
Yeah.

1610
01:13:40,457 --> 01:13:43,085
If you think about it,
the preservatives are…

1611
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,254
Keeping the thumb intact.

1612

Nobody's thinking about that.

She was right. You're out of control.

"She"?

As in the Mrs. Man from Toronto,
your handler.

That means I got the big meats in the back

01:41:56,985 --> 01:41:59,363
He's over that frozen bear
on the lake thing.

2208
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:02,825
- Oh, totally over that bear thing.
- Question, did you guys like this?

2209
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:04,284
- Teddy.
- [Teddy] Do we…

2210
01:42:04,368 --> 01:42:06,328
- I don't know what it is.
- [Anne] Durian sorbet.

2211
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:09,331
I wanna be polite, so
I don't like it, but I'm gonna finish it.

2212
01:42:09,414 --> 01:42:12,126
- Congratulations on your new restaurant.
- Hello.

2213
01:42:12,209 --> 01:42:13,460
- Hey. [chuckles]
- There he is.

2214
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:17,798
Lori, you look fantastic.
How's that little loaf rising?

2215
01:42:17,881 --> 01:42:21,593
- What?
- I want to murder everyone all the time.

2216
01:42:21,677 --> 01:42:22,594
- So…
- Yeah.

2217
01:42:22,678 --> 01:42:25,013
- I've been there. Hey, baby.
- Hi.

2218
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:27,545
- Thank you.
- Oh, I'll get this.

2219
01:42:27,599 --> 01:42:29,309
- No, stop. I got it. I got it.
- No. I…

2220
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:30,936
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2221
01:42:31,019 --> 01:42:33,689
- [Toronto] Okay. That's very nice.
- Back off. No problem.

2222
01:42:33,772 --> 01:42:36,316
What is this?
Is this a three or an eight? I can't tell.

2223
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,443
- Can you see that?
- Oh God. Low toner.

2224
01:42:38,527 --> 01:42:41,155
Low toner. What type of man
doesn't have a spare toner?

2225
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:42,238
It's an eight.

2226
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:47,703
Well, thank you for a delicious meal, man.

2227
01:42:47,786 --> 01:42:50,539
We, uh, we appreciate it,
and we'll get the next one.

2228
01:42:50,622 --> 01:42:51,623
[chuckles]

2229
01:42:51,707 --> 01:42:54,042
- I got good news. Babe, give me a sec.
- Of course.

2230
01:42:54,126 --> 01:42:55,210
- You, come here.
- Yeah.

2231
01:42:55,294 --> 01:42:57,546
Come here. You ready for this one?

2232
01:42:58,297 --> 01:43:01,466
I took the liberty
of making you a partner in my online gym.

2233
01:43:01,550 --> 01:43:03,260
Big moment for us.

2234
01:43:03,343 --> 01:43:06,555
I'm celebrating, which means
I'm gonna let you celebrate too.

2235
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:11,602
What I have in my hand right now
is your first down payment for your car.

2236
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,605
[chuckling]

2237
01:43:15,647 --> 01:43:17,524
Is that a one or a seven?

2238
01:43:17,608 --> 01:43:19,234
- That's a one. Yeah.
- Hmm.

2239
01:43:19,318 --> 01:43:21,236
I want Debora back.

2240
01:43:21,904 --> 01:43:24,740
The chassis was cut in half.
The engine practically evaporated.

2241
01:43:24,823 --> 01:43:25,657
She's gone.

2242
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:27,409
- That's your problem.
- Cut the shit!

2243
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,620
Ow! I can't believe you actually did it!

2244
01:43:29,703 --> 01:43:32,164
[upbeat music playing]

2245
01:43:32,247 --> 01:43:33,832
[bell ringing]

2246
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:37,044
[gunshot sound effect]

2247
01:43:37,127 --> 01:43:39,838
{\an8}Yeah! Way to go, guys.

2248
01:43:39,922 --> 01:43:41,882
{\an8}Welcome. Welcome to Teddy box.

2249
01:43:41,965 --> 01:43:44,927
{\an8}I, of course, am Teddy Jackson,
and guess what?

2250
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:48,555
{\an8}Here, the only opponent is yourself.
Don't you forget it.

2251
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:51,558
{\an8}We're brick-and-mortar now, guys,
which means things are changing.

2252
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:53,185
{\an8}They're getting bigger and better!

2253
01:43:53,268 --> 01:43:55,729
{\an8}And we're bringing you
one online class per week!

2254
01:43:55,812 --> 01:43:57,689
{\an8}That means I can talk to you guys live.

2255
01:43:57,773 --> 01:44:01,151
{\an8}And today,
we got our first ever online call.

2256
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:03,612
{\an8}Uh, calling all the way from Toronto.

2257
01:44:03,695 --> 01:44:05,322
{\an8}Um, okay. [laughs]

2258
01:44:05,405 --> 01:44:06,405
{\an8}Talk to me.

2259
01:44:06,823 --> 01:44:08,909
{\an8}[Toronto]
<i>I had a dream about her last night.</i>

2260
01:44:10,494 --> 01:44:11,536
{\an8}That's graphic.

2261
01:44:11,620 --> 01:44:14,498
{\an8}That's… That's a lot, sir.
I wanna remind you that we're live.

2262
01:44:14,581 --> 01:44:18,001
{\an8}We got about 8,000 viewers
in here right now, not to mention kids.

2263
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:19,878
{\an8}- So we keep...
- <i>I miss her.</i>

2264
01:44:20,587 --> 01:44:23,715
{\an8}Quite sure you miss her
for good reason, sir. Whoever she is.

2265
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:25,759
{\an8}<i>You know damn well who.</i>

2266
01:44:25,842 --> 01:44:26,927
{\an8}<i>Debora.</i>

2267
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:28,010
{\an8}<i>You killed her.</i>

2268
01:44:28,053 --> 01:44:29,721
{\an8}Oh, stop that.

2269
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:31,014
{\an8}Not while we're live.

2270
01:44:31,098 --> 01:44:34,017
{\an8}You don't tell anybody they killed
somebody, especially without proof.

2271
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:36,103
{\an8}That's what we call a strong accusation.

2272
01:44:36,186 --> 01:44:37,186
{\an8}Not true at all.

2273
01:44:37,229 --> 01:44:40,774
{\an8}<i>Maybe I should come down there
and non-contact your face.</i>

2274
01:44:40,857 --> 01:44:41,900
{\an8}Or not, sir.

2275
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:45,362
{\an8}This is online, so you don't have to come
all the way from Toronto

2276
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:46,905
{\an8}when you can talk to me now.

2277
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:49,533
{\an8}- That's the beauty.
<i>- I'm not in Toronto, Teddy.</i>

2278
01:44:49,616 --> 01:44:51,910
What does that mean? What are you saying?

2279
01:44:52,494 --> 01:44:53,495
Where are you?

2280
01:44:53,578 --> 01:44:55,372
<i>I'm standing outside.</i>

2281
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:56,581
[hangs up]

2282
01:44:57,249 --> 01:44:58,333
Oh, [bleep]!

2283
01:44:58,417 --> 01:45:01,878
